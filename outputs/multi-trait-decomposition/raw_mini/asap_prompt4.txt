### Writing Quality Rubric

#### Dimension 1: Understanding of the Text (0-10 points)
This dimension assesses the writer's comprehension of the story's themes, characters, and events. A high-scoring response will demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the text, including its complexities and underlying messages.

- **10-8 points**: The response shows a deep understanding of the text, addressing the complexities of the characters and themes. It effectively analyzes the significance of the concluding paragraph in relation to the entire narrative.
- **7-5 points**: The response demonstrates a general understanding of the text, addressing key themes and characters but may lack depth in analysis. It connects the conclusion to the story but may not fully explore its implications.
- **4-2 points**: The response shows a limited understanding of the text, focusing on surface-level details without engaging with the deeper themes or complexities. Connections to the conclusion may be weak or unclear.
- **1-0 points**: The response indicates minimal or no understanding of the text, failing to address the prompt meaningfully.

#### Dimension 2: Use of Textual Evidence (0-10 points)
This dimension evaluates how well the writer incorporates evidence from the text to support their claims. A strong response will include specific examples and quotes that reinforce the analysis.

- **10-8 points**: The response effectively uses multiple relevant examples and quotes from the text to support its claims, enhancing the overall argument.
- **7-5 points**: The response includes some relevant examples and quotes, but may not fully integrate them into the analysis or may rely on fewer examples than necessary.
- **4-2 points**: The response provides minimal textual evidence, with examples that may not clearly support the claims made. Connections between evidence and analysis may be weak.
- **1-0 points**: The response lacks textual evidence or includes irrelevant information that does not support the analysis.

#### Dimension 3: Clarity and Coherence (0-10 points)
This dimension assesses the organization and clarity of the writing. A high-scoring response will present ideas logically and cohesively, making it easy for the reader to follow the argument.

- **10-8 points**: The response is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Ideas flow logically, and transitions between points are smooth.
- **7-5 points**: The response is generally organized but may have some unclear sections or awkward transitions. The main ideas are present but could be more clearly articulated.
- **4-2 points**: The response lacks clear organization, making it difficult to follow. Ideas may be presented in a disjointed manner, with little coherence between points.
- **1-0 points**: The response is poorly organized or incoherent, making it challenging for the reader to understand the argument.

#### Dimension 4: Language and Mechanics (0-10 points)
This dimension evaluates the writer's use of language, including grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary. A strong response will demonstrate a command of language and minimal errors.

- **10-8 points**: The response uses varied and appropriate vocabulary, with few to no grammatical or mechanical errors. Language enhances the argument.
- **7-5 points**: The response contains some errors in grammar or mechanics but does not significantly impede understanding. Vocabulary is generally appropriate.
- **4-2 points**: The response has frequent grammatical or mechanical errors that may distract the reader. Vocabulary may be limited or inappropriate for the context.
- **1-0 points**: The response is riddled with errors that severely hinder understanding, and vocabulary is inappropriate or overly simplistic.
