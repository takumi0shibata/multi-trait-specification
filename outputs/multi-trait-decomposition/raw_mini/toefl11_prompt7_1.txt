### Task Response Description
The 'Task Response' evaluates how well a response addresses the prompt, the clarity and development of the position taken, and the relevance and support of the ideas presented.

### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-1**: The response fails to address the task, is completely unrelated, or is a memorized answer with no relevance to the prompt.

- **Score 2-3**: The response barely engages with the task, lacks a clear position, and presents few ideas that are largely undeveloped or irrelevant.

- **Score 4-5**: The response partially addresses the task but may be tangential or unclear; it expresses a position that is not well developed, with limited main ideas and some irrelevant details.

- **Score 6-7**: The response addresses all parts of the task with a clear position, though some ideas may be inadequately developed or repetitive; it presents relevant main ideas but may lack focus in supporting details.

- **Score 8-9**: The response fully addresses all aspects of the task, presenting a well-developed position with relevant, extended, and well-supported ideas throughout.
