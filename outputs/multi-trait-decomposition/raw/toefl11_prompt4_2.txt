### Score Intervals and Characteristics

**Score 0-1:**

- The organization of ideas is very limited, with little to no logical progression. Cohesive devices are rarely used and do not effectively connect ideas.

**Score 4-5:**
- Information is presented with some organization, but overall progression is lacking. Cohesive devices may be used inaccurately or repetitively, and paragraphing may be inadequate or confusing.

**Score 6-7:**
- Ideas are arranged coherently with a clear overall progression. A range of cohesive devices is used effectively, although there may be occasional faults. Paragraphing is present but may not always be logical.

**Score 8-9:**
- Information and ideas are sequenced logically with skillful management of cohesion. Paragraphing is appropriate and enhances the clarity of the text, attracting no attention to itself.
