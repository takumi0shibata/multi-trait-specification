### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-2**: Extremely limited vocabulary with little to no control over word formation and spelling; communication is severely impaired or impossible.

- **Score 3-4**: Very basic vocabulary used repetitively or inappropriately; limited control over word formation and spelling, causing strain for the reader.

- **Score 5-6**: Adequate vocabulary that meets the task requirements; attempts to use less common words may be present, but inaccuracies and errors in spelling or word formation are noticeable yet do not impede communication.

- **Score 7-8**: Sufficient to wide range of vocabulary used flexibly and fluently; includes less common lexical items with some awareness of style, though occasional inaccuracies may occur.

- **Score 9-10**: Extensive and sophisticated vocabulary with natural control; conveys precise meanings effectively, with only rare minor errors that do not detract from overall communication.
