- **10-8 points:** The response shows a comprehensive understanding of the text, addressing all aspects of the prompt with insightful analysis. It effectively integrates both explicit and implicit details from the excerpt to support conclusions.
- **7-5 points:** The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, addressing most aspects of the prompt. It includes relevant details from the excerpt but may lack depth in analysis or connection to the conclusion.
- **4-2 points:** The response shows a partial understanding of the text, addressing some aspects of the prompt but lacking clarity or depth. It includes minimal details from the excerpt, which may not fully support the conclusions drawn.
- **1-0 points:** The response shows little to no understanding of the text. It may misinterpret the prompt or provide irrelevant information, lacking any meaningful connection to the excerpt.

#### Dimension 2: Use of Evidence (0-10 points)
This dimension assesses how effectively the writer uses evidence from the text to support their claims. It looks at the relevance and integration of quotes or examples from the excerpt.

- **10-8 points:** The response uses multiple, well-chosen examples from the text that are seamlessly integrated into the analysis. The evidence strongly supports the claims made and enhances the overall argument.
- **7-5 points:** The response includes relevant examples from the text, but they may not be as thoroughly integrated or may lack variety. The evidence supports the claims but could be more compelling.
- **4-2 points:** The response provides minimal evidence from the text, which may be vague or not directly relevant to the claims made. The connection between evidence and analysis is weak.
