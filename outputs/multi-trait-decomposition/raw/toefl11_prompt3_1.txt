### Task Response Description
The 'Task Response' evaluates how well a response addresses the prompt, the clarity and development of the position taken, and the relevance and support of the ideas presented.

### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-1**: The response fails to address the task or is completely unrelated, showing no attempt to engage with the prompt.

- **Score 2-3**: The response barely engages with the task, lacks a clear position, and presents few ideas that are largely undeveloped or irrelevant.

- **Score 4-5**: The response addresses the task only partially, with some main ideas presented but lacking clarity and sufficient development; the position may be unclear or poorly supported.

- **Score 6-7**: The response adequately addresses all parts of the task, presenting a clear position with relevant ideas, though some may be underdeveloped or overly generalized.

- **Score 8-9**: The response fully addresses all aspects of the task, presenting a well-developed position with relevant, extended, and well-supported ideas throughout.
