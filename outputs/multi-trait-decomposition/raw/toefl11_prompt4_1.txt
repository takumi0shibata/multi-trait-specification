### Task Response Description
The "Task Response" evaluates how effectively a response addresses the prompt, presents a clear position, and develops ideas with relevant support.

### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-1**: The response is completely unrelated to the task or does not attempt the task in any way, showing no understanding or engagement with the prompt.

- **Score 2-3**: The response barely addresses the task, lacks a clear position, and presents few ideas that are largely undeveloped or irrelevant.

- **Score 4-5**: The response partially addresses the task but may have an inappropriate format; it expresses a position that is unclear, with limited main ideas that are not sufficiently developed.

- **Score 6-7**: The response addresses all parts of the task, presents a clear position, and includes relevant main ideas, though some may be inadequately developed or overly generalized.

- **Score 8-9**: The response fully addresses all parts of the task, presents a well-developed position with relevant, extended, and well-supported ideas, demonstrating a strong understanding of the prompt.
