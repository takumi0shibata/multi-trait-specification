Task Response evaluates how well a response addresses the prompt, presents a clear position, and develops ideas with relevant support.

### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-1**: The response is completely unrelated to the task or does not attempt the task in any way, showing no understanding or engagement with the prompt.

- **Score 2-3**: The response barely addresses the task, lacks a clear position, and presents few ideas that are largely undeveloped or irrelevant.

- **Score 4-5**: The response partially addresses the task with some relevant ideas, but the position may be unclear, and the development of main ideas is limited or includes irrelevant details.

- **Score 6-7**: The response addresses all parts of the task with a clear position, presenting relevant main ideas that are generally supported, though some ideas may be inadequately developed or overly generalized.

- **Score 8-9**: The response fully addresses all parts of the task, presents a well-developed position with relevant, extended, and well-supported ideas, demonstrating a strong understanding of the prompt.
