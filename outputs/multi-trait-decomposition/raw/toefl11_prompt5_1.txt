### Task Response Description
The 'Task Response' evaluates how well a response addresses the prompt, presents a clear position, and develops ideas with relevant support.

### Score Intervals and Characteristics

- **Score 0-1**: The response is completely unrelated to the task or does not attempt the task in any way, showing no understanding or engagement with the prompt.

- **Score 2-3**: The response barely addresses the task, lacks a clear position, and presents few ideas that are largely undeveloped or irrelevant.

- **Score 4-5**: The response partially addresses the task but may be tangential or unclear; it expresses a position but lacks sufficient development and may include irrelevant details.

- **Score 6-7**: The response addresses all parts of the task with a clear position, presenting relevant main ideas, though some ideas may be inadequately developed or overly generalized.

- **Score 8-9**: The response fully addresses all parts of the task, presenting a well-developed position with relevant, extended, and well-supported ideas throughout.
