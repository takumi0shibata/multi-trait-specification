Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to respond to the prompt, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The writing is marred by numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The student's argument is also somewhat unclear, as they seem to be arguing that people should not take risks and try new things because it may lead to failure, but then they also mention the importance of humanization and the need for collaboration in achieving success. This confusion in the argument makes it difficult to fully understand the student's stance on the original statement.

The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simplistic phrases and sentences. For example, the phrase ""NO BODY SHOULD SUCCESS COUSING FAIL FOR SOME BODY ELS"" is grammatically incorrect and does not convey a clear message. Similarly, the sentence ""IF EVERY BODY DO THE SAME THING, THEN, WHERE IS THE HUMINATATION"" is unclear and contains several errors in spelling and punctuation.

However, the student has attempted to provide some examples to support their argument, such as the example of starting a company, which shows that they are trying to engage with the topic.

To improve, the student needs to work on developing a clear and coherent argument, using more complex vocabulary and sentence structures, and paying attention to grammar and punctuation.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt by presenting both sides of the argument and providing some relevant examples. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the topic and express a nuanced opinion. The student provides some interesting points, such as the importance of specialization in innovation and the role of experts in various fields. The use of examples from human evolution and art is also a good attempt to support the argument.

However, the essay suffers from several issues. Firstly, the writing is often unclear and lacks coherence. The student jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the transition from discussing the importance of specialization to the idea of having a broad knowledge base is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""acchieve"" instead of ""achieve,"" ""spezialize"" instead of ""specialize,"" and ""arrouses"" instead of ""arouses."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as ""you have the time and power to think about new ways and to be able to make experiments."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""you have the time and ability to think creatively and experiment.""

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and lacks a strong final statement. The idea of being a ""good expert"" who can concentrate on their strengths while still being aware of their limitations is a good point, but it is not fully developed.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic and provided specific reasons to support their disagreement with the statement. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of transitional phrases. The student has also provided concrete examples from their personal experience and cited a study from the Ministry of Education of Korea to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""It is often said that"" and ""In short"" are quite common and could be replaced with more complex expressions. Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the data from the Ministry of Education of Korea, rather than simply stating the statistics.

Furthermore, the student's use of grammar and sentence structure is generally good, but there are some minor errors, such as ""damaged ny huricane"" (should be ""damaged by hurricane"") and ""the young peoplebeing considered as virtuous"" (should be ""young people being considered virtuous""). These errors do not significantly detract from the overall coherence of the essay, but could be improved upon.

Evaluation:

The student has made a sincere effort to express their opinion on the given topic, and their writing demonstrates a basic understanding of the subject matter. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""mordern,"" ""dillemma,"" ""rending,"" ""galance,"" ""argurments,"" ""si,"" ""unerstanding,"" ""innate quality of understanding ideas,"" ""invisable,"" ""prist,"" and ""intellecgence."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of understanding ideas to listing reasons in support of this claim. A more logical and cohesive structure would have made the essay easier to follow.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples and supporting evidence is limited. While the example of the student's parents teaching them to understand ideas is a good start, it could be developed further to provide more insight into the benefits of understanding ideas.

Fourthly, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. The essay relies heavily on simplistic statements, such as ""understanding ideas is more interesting than learning facts"" and ""understanding ideas is easier for students to understand."" More complex and thought-provoking ideas would have added depth to the essay.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. A more effective conclusion would have tied together the various reasons and examples presented in the essay.

Evaluation:
The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a balanced argument. The writer presents both the advantages and disadvantages of specializing in one subject, using specific examples from Andrew Wiles's experience as a mathematician. The essay also acknowledges the potential drawbacks of specialization, such as boredom and the risk of missing out on other opportunities for growth and understanding.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. At times, the ideas seem to jump abruptly from one point to another, making it slightly difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

The student's use of vocabulary is generally good, with some impressive examples of complex sentences and phrases. However, there are a few instances of awkward phrasing and word choice, such as ""it is not contained in a box"" and ""one can get easily distracted."" These phrases, while attempting to convey a point, could be rephrased for greater clarity and effectiveness.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between different subjects and how they can be interconnected. The example of Andrew Wiles's work highlights the importance of having a broad knowledge base and being willing to explore new ideas and methods.

Overall, the student's essay shows a good attempt at addressing the prompt and providing a balanced argument. With some refinement in terms of structure, transitions, and sentence-level writing, the essay could be even stronger.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides specific reasons and examples to support this claim, showcasing the student's ability to think critically and connect their ideas to real-life scenarios.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a personal anecdote about the local Red Cross facility, which effectively illustrates the issue of decreasing membership and the lack of time among young people. The student also provides a valid point about the impact of new inventions on people's lifestyles, suggesting that the abundance of free time is not being utilized for community service.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as some ideas seem disconnected. Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""ohteres,"" ""sise,"" ""sceduals,"" ""telecomunications,"" ""waching,"" and ""do thomet."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion could be more impactful if it were more concise and directly tied to the main argument. The final sentence, ""In conclusion I agree to the statement but I think helping in communities could be easily improved if people try it,"" feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Evaluation:

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given prompt, and their essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks specificity. The statement ""I like to spend more time on the theories and I want others do the same thing as well"" is not a strong argument and does not directly address the prompt. A more effective thesis statement would be ""I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts because it leads to significant advancements in our world and contributes to a better future.""

Secondly, the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs is limited. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of theories to highlighting the problems in the world. To improve this, the student could use transitional phrases or sentences to connect the ideas and make the essay flow more smoothly.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the examples of Einstein, Edison, and genetically modified foods are relevant, they are not fully developed and lack analysis. The student could provide more depth and explanation of how these examples support their argument.

Lastly, the student's writing contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""i"" instead of ""I,"" ""fututre"" instead of ""future,"" and ""countinued"" instead of ""continued."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, effectively arguing that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student has provided relevant examples from various fields, such as electrical engineering and swimming, to support their argument.

Strengths:

1. The student has effectively used a Chinese proverb to introduce the topic and set the tone for the essay. This shows creativity and an attempt to engage the reader.
2. The examples provided are relevant and help to illustrate the point being made. The student has also attempted to explain the importance of understanding in each scenario.
3. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the concept of understanding and its application in real-life situations.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the concepts being discussed. At times, the student relies on general statements rather than providing specific examples or evidence to support their claims.
2. The writing could be more polished, with some sentences being wordy or awkwardly phrased. For example, the sentence ""It is obviously more important to understand things that it is to learn facts about them"" could be rephrased for clarity.

Evaluation: 

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three reasons to support their stance on specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The opening sentence is a paraphrased version of the prompt, and the student's opinion is not explicitly stated until the second paragraph. This creates confusion and makes it challenging to follow the student's argument.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""is it better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects,"" ""Ipefer,"" and ""e.t.c."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and lacks depth. While the example of Einstein is a good start, it is not fully developed, and the student fails to explain how Einstein's specialization led to his discoveries. Additionally, the student's statement ""all the people would not be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects"" is a vague and unsupported claim.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is a reiteration of their initial statement, which does not provide a satisfying conclusion to the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to demonstrate a more effective and coherent argument.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a clear and concise thesis statement, agreeing with the statement and offering reasons to support their answer.
2.  The essay attempts to address the prompt by providing three main points: the opportunity to make friends with the tour guide, the safety aspect, and the convenience of traveling with a group.
3.  The student has used transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, although they could be more varied and sophisticated.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and logical structure. The introduction does not provide a clear overview of the main points, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth.
2.  The student has used simple and basic vocabulary, which may not be suitable for a second-language learner. For example, ""Basically,"" ""not only people local cevilians,"" and ""neccesary"" are not grammatically correct.
3.  The student has not provided specific and detailed examples to support their arguments. For instance, the statement ""there is many advantage"" should be ""there are many advantages.""
4.  The student has not addressed potential counterarguments or opposing views, which is an essential aspect of a well-rounded essay.
5.  The conclusion is abrupt and does not summarize the main points effectively.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the introduction to provide a clear overview of the main points and a thesis statement that sets the tone for the essay.
2.  Use more sophisticated vocabulary and grammar to improve the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.
3.  Provide specific and detailed examples to support each argument, such as describing a personal experience or a real-life scenario.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. They provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, drawing from their mother's experiences and their own experiences as a junior high school student. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization, as well as more nuanced and detailed explanations of the reasons behind the decline in community involvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes, which provide a relatable and engaging perspective on the topic. The student's mother's stories about the community events she participated in when she was young offer a valuable contrast to the student's own experiences, highlighting the differences between past and present. Additionally, the student's experiences as a junior high school student, participating in volunteer work in other communities, demonstrate their awareness of the issue and their willingness to engage in community service.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as the ideas and examples seem to jump abruptly from one to another. For instance, the transition from the mother's stories to the student's own experiences could be smoother. Secondly, the student could provide more detailed explanations of the reasons behind the decline in community involvement, such as the impact of technology, changes in societal values, or the lack of opportunities for young people to engage with their communities. Finally, the student could provide more specific examples of how young people can be encouraged to participate in community service and build stronger relationships with their communities.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and supporting it with some reasons and examples. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and organization, which makes it challenging to follow the student's argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the presence of grammatical errors, such as ""pubblic transports"" instead of ""public transports,"" ""prefere"" instead of ""prefer,"" and ""addiction"" instead of ""addition."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

In terms of content, the student has identified some valid points, such as the negative impact of cars on the environment and the preference for public transportation. However, the student's argument is weakened by the inclusion of contradictory statements, such as the idea that people will not leave their cars at home because cars are a status symbol, and the expectation that technology will eliminate pollution. These statements undermine the student's initial claim that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student expresses a personal preference for using bicycles or public transportation but then states that they do not think this will be possible, which creates confusion about the student's stance on the issue.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main points to support their opinion that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. The sentence ""People are aware that those are main sources of TV broadcasting companies to get a lot of profit"" seems to be a non-sequitur and does not directly relate to the main topic. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear statement of the student's stance on the issue and a brief overview of the main points to be discussed.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate. For example, ""various media can be a good method to assure that producs are flawless"" should be ""various media can be a good method to assure that products are flawless"" (subject-verb agreement error). Additionally, ""nobody would be doubtful about the qualities of them"" is a bit awkwardly phrased and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Thirdly, the student's supporting examples are somewhat simplistic and lack concrete evidence. While the idea that famous people endorsing products can make them seem more appealing is a valid point, it would be more convincing if the student provided specific examples or statistics to support this claim. Similarly, the statement that companies don't mention the side effects of their products is a common criticism of advertising, but the student could have provided more nuanced analysis or evidence to support this claim.

Finally, the student's conclusion is very brief and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have provided a final thought or reflection on the issue and re-emphasized the student's stance on the topic.

Evaluation: 

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the statement, and the writer provides some relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes to illustrate the benefits of taking risks. The example of a student moving to a new city is a good way to show how trying new things can broaden one's horizons and lead to personal growth. Additionally, the writer's point about learning from mistakes and building a stronger personality is well-made and supported by a relatable example.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that taking risks improves one's chances of success, but they could have provided specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. Secondly, the writer's writing could be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""Many people associate sucess with monetary compensation, others with personal satisfaction"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

Furthermore, the writer could have addressed potential counterarguments to their stance, which would have added depth and nuance to their argument. Finally, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. They have provided specific reasons and examples to support their argument, which is a positive aspect of their essay.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the introduction could be more effective in grabbing the reader's attention and providing a clear thesis statement. The sentence ""It is a challenging question that whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"" is a good starting point, but it could be rephrased to make it more engaging.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The ideas presented in each paragraph are clear, but the connections between them are not always smooth. For instance, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph could be improved to make it clearer how the idea of specialization is related to the previous point about the limitations of broad knowledge.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the sentence ""this tells people that you are not a qualified person"" could be rephrased to ""this suggests that you are not a specialist in any particular area."" The use of ""spacialization"" instead of ""specialization"" is also an error.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The student's conclusion is a bit repetitive and could be condensed to make it more concise.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has also provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a key requirement of the prompt.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to present both sides of the argument, acknowledging the potential advantages and disadvantages of being young and old. This shows a good level of critical thinking and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. The student also uses transitional phrases and connecting words to link their ideas together, which helps to create a cohesive and easy-to-follow text.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, the phrase ""at first sight"" is a common expression that could be replaced with something more original, such as ""initially"" or ""at a glance."" Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""in few words at this age, people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want"" could be broken up into two separate sentences for clarity.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. While they provide some good points, they could delve deeper into the reasons why being young or old might be more enjoyable. For example, they mention that older people have more experience, but they could explain how this experience translates into a more enjoyable life.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be stronger. While they summarize their main points, they could also reiterate their thesis statement and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides some specific reasons and examples to support their answer, including the fact that young people prefer to party with friends, study, or play games instead of helping their community. The writer also mentions the importance of community support, citing examples of historical figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Guru Nanak.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are often inaccurate, with errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, ""Now a days"" should be ""Nowadays,"" ""the have"" should be ""they have,"" and ""He should therefore work for it to take his community to great heights"" is a convoluted sentence that could be rephrased for clarity.

Additionally, the writer's examples, while well-intentioned, are not always relevant or effectively integrated into the essay. The comparison between Mahatma Gandhi and Guru Nanak, for instance, feels tacked on and could be more smoothly incorporated into the discussion. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence or specific examples of how young people can help their communities, beyond general statements about the importance of community service.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can come across as somewhat didactic and prescriptive, with phrases like ""The should therefore wake up from their sleep"" and ""He should serve his community as best as he can.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the advantages of being young, such as having fewer responsibilities, better physical health, and a more positive mental attitude. The examples provided, such as paying bills and having energy to take on responsibilities, are relevant and easy to understand.

However, the student's argument is not entirely convincing, as they fail to consider the potential benefits of being older, such as life experience, wisdom, and a greater appreciation for life. The student also makes general statements about older people, such as ""they have a negative attitude towards life,"" which is not supported by evidence.

In terms of language, the student has made some grammatical errors, such as ""It is age what make our lives"" (should be ""It is age that makes our lives""), ""the responsabilities they have in their lives"" (should be ""the responsibilities they have in their lives""), and ""this Psycologic aspect"" (should be ""this psychological aspect""). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentence structures.

Thirdly, the student's supporting examples are somewhat relevant but lack depth and analysis. For instance, the example of Japan's traffic jams is interesting, but the student fails to provide a clear connection between the high number of cars and the traffic jams. A more in-depth analysis of the relationship between car usage and traffic congestion would strengthen the argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, supporting the idea that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The essay provides two main reasons for this stance: the plentiness and complexity of knowledge. 

The student starts by mentioning the accumulation of information since the 17th century, which is a valid point. However, the example of university departments and subdepartments is somewhat unclear and could be better explained. The student could have provided more specific details about how this affects the feasibility of acquiring broad knowledge. 

The second reason, the complexity of knowledge, is well-expressed, particularly in the example of curing AIDS. The student effectively illustrates how specializing in a specific subject, such as viruses, is more relevant to solving the problem than having a broad knowledge of various subjects like optics, psychology, and literature. This example demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the importance of specialization.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and a clearer conclusion that summarizes the main points. Additionally, some minor grammatical errors and typos are present throughout the essay, which may affect the overall clarity of the writing.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect word choices, and a lack of coherence. The student's writing is often unclear, making it challenging to follow their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's use of vocabulary. Words such as ""siginificant,"" ""raraly,"" ""successiful,"" ""learnd,"" ""well-liked,"" and ""momentous"" are not only misspelled but also do not accurately convey the intended meaning. For instance, the student uses ""siginificant"" instead of ""significant,"" which would have strengthened their argument. Similarly, ""raraly"" should be replaced with ""rarely"" to convey the intended meaning.

Furthermore, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety. The use of short, simple sentences, such as ""Many people would be propose that students are understanded ideas and concepts more siginificant than they are learned the facts. I can hardly agree with. The students learn facts are more beneficial for them,"" makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

In terms of content, the student attempts to provide reasons to support their argument, but these reasons are often vague and lack concrete examples. For instance, the student states that learning facts allows students to become well-developed adults, but they fail to provide a clear explanation of what this means or how it is achieved.

The student also struggles to address the counterargument, which is a crucial aspect of the prompt. The student's response to the opposing view is brief and lacks depth, making it seem like they have not fully considered the opposing perspective.

Despite these issues, the student attempts to provide some examples to support their argument, such as the example of computer skills being necessary for employment. However, this example is not fully developed and could be strengthened with more detail.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. They provide specific examples to support their argument, including a TV commercial for a cleaner and a weight loss drug. The student also attempts to explain the consequences of such advertising practices, stating that it can lead to a loss of credibility and financial difficulties for the company.

However, there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety. Additionally, the student uses some grammatical errors, such as ""misslead"" instead of ""mislead"" and ""terns"" instead of ""turns.""

Furthermore, the student's examples could be more effective if they were more detailed and nuanced. For example, the student could have provided more information about the specific cleaner and weight loss drug they are referring to, or explained how these products were misrepresented in the advertisements.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be stronger. While they mention the potential consequences of deceptive advertising, they do not fully develop this idea or provide a clear summary of their main points.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of transitional phrases to connect paragraphs. The student provides specific examples to support their argument, such as the use of misleading information in advertisements and the influence of famous actors and actresses on consumer perception.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""All the advertisements are aiming to attract as many customers as they can. And how can they obtain this achivement?"" should be ""All advertisements aim to attract as many customers as they can. And how can they achieve this achievement?"" Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""We may see a set of comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl. But how can we believe it's just the effection of the food?"" which should be rephrased as ""We often see a comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl in advertisements. However, how can we believe that the food is solely responsible for the difference?""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. While they mention the lack of scientific proof in advertisements, they do not delve deeper into the consequences of this lack of evidence. Additionally, the student could have explored the role of consumerism and the impact of advertisements on society.

The student's conclusion is clear and concise, reiterating the importance of critical thinking when evaluating advertisements. However, the final sentence, ""A clever customer should try to evaluate and judge a product by him/herself,"" feels somewhat abrupt and could be connected more smoothly to the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, but their essay lacks depth and coherence. The writing is simple and lacks variety in sentence structure, which makes it difficult to follow at times. The student has identified three reasons to support their opinion, but they are not well-developed and lack specific examples to illustrate their points.

The first reason, ""to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps people think widely,"" is a good starting point, but the student fails to provide concrete examples to demonstrate how this is achieved. The sentence ""We can think more carefully about possibilities"" is vague and does not provide any insight into the student's thinking.

The second reason, ""to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps people cooperate with each other,"" is also underdeveloped. The student mentions that ""We can know about each other more"" and ""We have to help others,"" but these statements are not supported by any evidence or examples.

The third reason, ""to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects help people look many diversities,"" contains a grammatical error and is unclear. The student seems to be trying to say that having broad knowledge helps people appreciate diversity, but the sentence is not well-written.

The student's writing also lacks cohesion and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another without connecting them logically. Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given statement, providing some relevant reasons and examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and mention various alternatives to car usage, such as public transport, trains, ships, and planes. They also provide a valid point about the increasing oil price and the industry's response to it. Additionally, the student highlights the issue of overcrowding in cities, using Japan as an example, and suggests car-sharing as a potential solution.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""The industry reacted to this problem by building engines which need less petrol but because of the eclectronical equipment the sum of needed petrol could not be reduced"" is unclear and seems to contradict the previous point about the industry's response to the oil price increase. Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate, with errors such as ""diffgerent"" instead of ""different"" and ""governmants"" instead of ""governments"".

Another area for improvement is the student's ability to provide more detailed and specific examples to support their arguments. While they mention Japan as an example of overcrowding, they do not provide any further details about the specific cities or regions in Japan that are experiencing this issue. Additionally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has provided a well-structured essay with a logical flow of ideas. The writer has taken a stance on the statement, arguing that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years, and has supported their opinion with various reasons and examples.

Strengths:

1. The student has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, making the essay easy to follow.
2. They have provided specific examples, such as carpool lanes in Los Angeles, to support their argument.
3. The writer has acknowledged the importance of transportation and the need for people to have a way to get from one place to another.
4. The essay covers both sides of the argument, discussing the benefits of having a car (convenience) and the drawbacks (pollution and traffic).

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, expressing a strong opinion that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay is well-structured, with three main points supporting the argument: the rapid evolution of technology, the reduction of toxic gases, and the awareness of future generations. 

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""The development of the car is an uncertain issue"" (should be ""The development of the car is an uncertain matter""), ""Actually, people used to live without cars but since it has been created"" (should be ""Actually, people used to live without cars, but since it was created""), and ""I trully believe"" (should be ""I truly believe""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""it will be easier and will save energy and time"" being overly simplistic. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""In a nutshell, even if I'm not sure that there will be more and more pedestrians, I'm trully convinced that cars don't belong to future but to past"" (should be rephrased for better clarity).

The student's use of examples is somewhat superficial, relying on vague notions of ""new technology"" and ""teleportation"" without providing concrete evidence or explanations. The mention of the Kyoto agreement is a good start, but it is not fully developed or connected to the main argument.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the rapid evolution of technology to the reduction of toxic gases, and then to the awareness of future generations. A clearer transition between these points would improve the essay's coherence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, but their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument. The student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of precise vocabulary. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's failure to provide a clear and concise thesis statement. The opening sentence, ""In my opinion in some cases it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, instead, in another cases, it's better to specialize in only one or two specific subjects,"" is vague and does not effectively convey the student's main argument. 

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is inadequate, resulting in a disjointed and hard-to-follow essay. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of broad knowledge in primary, secondary, and high school to the need for specialization in university. This lack of cohesion makes it challenging to understand the student's reasoning.

The student attempts to provide specific examples, such as the importance of being a ""very good professionist in one thing to be different from the mass,"" but these examples are not well-supported and lack concrete evidence. Additionally, the student's criticism of Italian universities and the job market is not relevant to the topic at hand and seems to be a tangent.

In terms of content, the student touches on some valid points, such as the value of broad knowledge and the need for specialization. However, these points are not developed thoroughly, and the student fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and well-structured essay. The writer has effectively used the phrase ""it depends on the situation"" to introduce the idea that the answer to the question is not a simple yes or no, but rather depends on the individual's circumstances. This is a good strategy for second language learners as it shows an awareness of the complexity of the issue.

The writer has also provided two clear and well-supported arguments for and against hiring a tour guide. The first argument, which suggests that a tour guide is beneficial for first-time visitors, is well-supported with examples of the benefits of having a guide, such as seeing the most important places, learning about the culture, and understanding the history of the region. The second argument, which suggests that hiring a tour guide is unnecessary for repeat visitors, is also well-supported with examples of the potential drawbacks of hiring a guide, such as the cost and the fact that the guide may take visitors to places they have already seen.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. For example, instead of simply stating that a tour guide can help visitors learn about the culture, the writer could have provided specific examples of cultural experiences that a tour guide could facilitate, such as attending a traditional festival or trying local cuisine. Additionally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claim that hiring a tour guide is a waste of money and time for repeat visitors.

The writer's language is generally clear and easy to understand, although there are some errors in grammar and vocabulary. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""it depends of the situation"" instead of ""it depends on the situation"" and ""I will absolutly recomend"" instead of ""I absolutely recommend"". The writer also uses some colloquial expressions, such as ""I think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal"", which could be rephrased for more formal tone.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""serve as a parth,"" ""broden,"" ""uniquness,"" ""oppurtunity,"" and ""acdemic."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. It is essential for the student to proofread their work more thoroughly to eliminate such mistakes.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For instance, the transition from the first to the second paragraph is abrupt, and the student could have used a more effective transition to connect the ideas. Similarly, the use of connecting words like ""Moreover"" and ""In conclusion"" is not consistent throughout the essay.

Thirdly, the student's examples and supporting evidence are not always convincing or well-integrated into the essay. For instance, the anecdote about the student's friend who specialized in science courses is not directly related to the main argument, and the student could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claim that having broad knowledge is essential for understanding the world around us.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat repetitive, restating the main argument without adding any new insights or perspectives. A more effective conclusion would summarize the main points and reiterate the thesis statement in a more nuanced and sophisticated way.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, providing three main points to support their disagreement with the statement. Their essay structure is generally coherent, and they have attempted to use examples to illustrate their points. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues is the lack of clarity and concision in sentence structure and vocabulary. Many sentences are wordy and contain grammatical errors, which can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For instance, in the first paragraph, the sentence ""If a person has a lot of experience on doing one job, he can usually make the best decision when a problem comes out"" could be rephrased to ""Having a lot of experience in a job helps a person make the best decision when faced with a problem.""

Additionally, the student could benefit from providing more specific and concrete examples to support their points. While they mention that experience, time, and the possibility of success are important factors, they do not provide concrete examples to illustrate how these factors contribute to success. For example, they could have discussed a historical figure or a real-life example of someone who achieved success through experience and familiarity with a particular job.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel somewhat disjointed. For instance, the transition from the second to the third point is abrupt, and the student could have used a connecting phrase to link the ideas more smoothly.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized their stance on the topic. Instead of simply restating their disagreement, they could have provided a final thought or a call to action.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey the writer's argument. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their disagreement with the statement, but there are some issues with grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's attempt to use specific examples to support their argument. For instance, the writer mentions their parents' travel experiences and their uncle's pension, which could be seen as evidence that older people have more opportunities to enjoy life. However, the writer fails to provide a clear connection between these examples and the main argument.

The writer also struggles with grammar and vocabulary. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""Our live become more and more wonderful and convinent"" should be ""Our lives become more and more wonderful and convenient."" Additionally, ""begain"" should be ""begin,"" and ""incridible"" should be ""incredible.""

Furthermore, the writer's argument is not well-organized, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the travel industry to mentioning their uncle's pension, which makes the essay feel disjointed.

The writer also fails to address the counterargument, which is a crucial aspect of a persuasive essay. The writer simply states that older people enjoy life more than young people without providing any evidence to support this claim.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. They provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the use of prominent sportsmen in advertisements for aerated drinks and the overexaggeration of beauty products. The student also attempts to address the potential effectiveness of these advertisements in persuading consumers, particularly teenagers.

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student provides concrete examples to support their argument, making their opinion more convincing.
- They attempt to address the potential impact of advertisements on consumers, particularly teenagers.
- The student demonstrates an understanding of the purpose of advertisements, which is to capture the audience and make a sale.

Weaknesses of the essay include:

- The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth in their analysis. For example, they state that ""everyone knows that having a drink wouldn't make them a star or play like one,"" but they do not elaborate on why this is the case or what the implications are.
- The student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The student's writing is riddled with errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure, making it challenging to understand their intended message. 

The student starts by stating their agreement with the statement but fails to provide a clear and logical explanation. The first reason provided is that people are not as healthy as they are today due to their reliance on cars. However, this is not a convincing argument, as it does not directly relate to the number of cars in use. The student also mentions that people will not walk as much in the future, which is a vague statement and lacks concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""i think"" instead of ""I think,"" ""futrue"" instead of ""future,"" ""is not as healthy as now becaus"" instead of ""is not as healthy as they are now because,"" and ""people is"" instead of ""people are."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to assess the student's understanding of the topic.

The student's conclusion is also unclear, as they mention that people will know it not far from today, which seems to be a non-sequitur.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" They provide some valid reasons to support their opinion, including the difficulties in deciding on a destination that suits everyone and the potential for stress in group travel. However, their writing could benefit from more coherence and organization.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use simple yet effective vocabulary to convey their ideas. For instance, they use phrases such as ""I think,"" ""I believe,"" and ""in my opinion"" to express their thoughts, which is a good practice for second language learners. Additionally, they attempt to provide specific examples to support their arguments, such as the ability to visit destinations they want to see and enjoy sights for longer periods.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas jumping abruptly from one point to another. For example, the student starts by mentioning the difficulties of group travel, then shifts to the benefits of solo travel without a clear connection between the two ideas. Furthermore, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""Travering definitely is not getting stress."" This suggests that the student may need to work on sentence-level grammar and vocabulary.

To improve their writing, the student could benefit from more practice in organizing their ideas and using transitional phrases to connect their thoughts. They should also focus on refining their sentence-level grammar and vocabulary to make their writing more polished and engaging.

The essay demonstrates a good effort from the student in addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but the writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherence in some paragraphs.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student seems to be arguing that both young and old people can enjoy life, but this is not explicitly stated in the introduction. The essay meanders through various points, including the differences between young and old people, the idea that young people's lives are centered around college, friends, and partying, and the importance of old people in society.

The student attempts to provide examples to support their points, but these are often vague and lack concrete evidence. For instance, the statement that ""young people are always getting in troubles"" is a generalization that is not supported by any specific examples. Similarly, the idea that old people's lives are centered around peace and family is not developed further.

The student also struggles with grammar and spelling, with numerous errors throughout the essay. For example, ""completly"" should be spelled ""completely,"" ""poeple"" should be spelled ""people,"" and ""defferences"" should be spelled ""differences."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student shows some potential in their writing. They attempt to provide a personal perspective on what it means to enjoy life, and they acknowledge that both young and old people can enjoy their lives. However, this potential is not fully realized due to the numerous errors and lack of coherence.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given topic, with the writer agreeing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides three main reasons to support this claim: lack of time, increased competition, and lack of awareness of responsibilities. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization, as the writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another without clear transitions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the mention of television actors and famous personalities who serve as role models. This adds depth to the writer's argument and makes it more convincing. Additionally, the writer attempts to provide a balanced view by acknowledging that there are some young people who do contribute to their communities.

However, the essay suffers from some grammatical errors, such as ""revolutoinary"" (should be ""revolutionary""), ""few choose of them"" (should be ""few of them""), and ""it is sad that few choose of them to remain so still"" (should be ""it is sad that few of them remain so still""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal examples and anecdotes to support the writer's argument. For instance, the writer states, ""A person with many interests will never renounce to the pleasure of knowing more and more different things."" This sentence effectively conveys the idea that having broad knowledge can bring personal satisfaction. Additionally, the writer provides a balanced view by acknowledging the advantages of both general and specialized education.

However, there are some grammatical and spelling errors that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""Me as many other students"" should be ""Like many other students,"" and ""renounce"" should be ""renounce"" (although the correct spelling is ""renounce"" in this context, it is more common to use ""renounce"" in the sense of giving up something, whereas the writer means ""renounce"" in the sense of not giving up, which is more commonly expressed as ""never give up""). Furthermore, the writer could have provided more specific examples to support their arguments, such as citing real-life scenarios or studies that demonstrate the benefits of general or specialized education.

The writer also uses some colloquial expressions, such as ""happier and happier,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing. Additionally, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claim that specialized education can make students ""much more rigid, unable to change and to handle with changes."" This statement seems to be based on a general assumption rather than specific evidence.

In terms of content, the writer raises an interesting point about the importance of considering one's personality and desires when choosing an educational path. However, this idea could have been explored more thoroughly, and the writer could have provided more concrete examples to support this claim.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic and provided some relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence, particularly in the transition between paragraphs. For instance, the sentence ""Let's say a teenager does live more on the riskier side of life and does take drugs from time to time or have more liberal sex habits than an adult would practice, this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and the society's limits"" seems disconnected from the rest of the essay. A more logical connection to the previous sentence would improve the flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of incorrect word usage. For example, ""behavoiur"" should be spelled as ""behavior,"" ""neccessary"" should be spelled as ""necessary,"" and ""todaz"" should be spelled as ""today."" Additionally, the student could benefit from using more precise and nuanced language to convey their ideas. For instance, instead of saying ""a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life,"" the student could say ""a more liberal lifestyle is often perceived as a hallmark of happiness.""

In terms of content, the student raises some interesting points about the differences in life satisfaction between young and old people. However, the essay could benefit from more concrete evidence and specific examples to support these claims. For instance, the student mentions that older people may have a ""quiet high level of life satisfaction,"" but it would be more convincing if they provided a specific example or statistic to back up this claim.

Additionally, ""we found many statues, parks, trees, trains and rivers"" should be ""we saw many statues, parks, trees, trains, and rivers.""

The writer provides several reasons to support their opinion, including the idea that young people have more time and energy to study, have more opportunities for entertainment, are generally healthier, and have more time to pursue their dreams.

However, there are several areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer jumps directly into providing reasons without a clear introduction that ties everything together.

Additionally, the writer's use of transitions between paragraphs is weak, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the use of computers among older people to stating that young people have more time and energy to have fun. A clearer connection between these ideas would make the essay flow better.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often informal and lacks precision. For example, the writer uses phrases such as ""Depending on personal experience, personality type and emotion concern"" and ""I am a young girl now, and I think I can do every thing if like."" These phrases are not grammatically correct and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Finally, the writer relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""Health is the basic of everything you want to do"" and ""young people have more chance and more time and more energy and more passion to lead a better life.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks a clear and direct answer to the question. The student seems to be arguing in favor of the statement, but the reasoning and examples provided are not well-organized and lack coherence.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating that enjoyment has different meanings, which is a valid point, but fails to connect it to the main topic of the essay. The student then jumps to discussing the characteristics of young people, such as being full of colors and ambitious, without providing a clear link to the statement.

The student also uses some relevant examples, such as the differences in behavior between young and old generations, but fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. The use of phrases like ""eventhough nowadays the younger generation is so competitive, career-oriented"" and ""their enjoyment levels and expressions directly corresponds with it"" is unclear and lacks specificity.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""avery different meanings,"" ""ma be,"" ""baame,"" ""generaation,"" ""opoosing,"" ""stioic,"" and ""imortant."" These errors make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

However, the student does attempt to provide some personal anecdotes, such as the example of celebrating festivals in a grand way, which shows some attempt to connect the topic to their personal experience.

The student has made a good effort to address the prompt and provide reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Strengths:

1.  The student has attempted to provide specific reasons and examples to support their argument, which is a crucial aspect of the prompt.
2.  They have made an effort to compare the past and present, which is a good approach to analyze the situation.
3.  The student has identified various factors that contribute to young people not investing time in helping their communities, such as the influence of social media, pressure to be successful, and the shift in focus from community to individualism.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The student has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims, relying heavily on general statements and vague examples.
3.  The writing is often unclear, with sentences that are wordy and difficult to follow.
4.  There are several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of articles.
5.  The student has not provided a clear conclusion that summarizes their main points and reiterates their opinion.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the thesis statement to clearly state the student's opinion and the main arguments that will be presented.
2.  Provide more specific and concrete evidence to support the claims, such as statistics, examples from personal experience, or quotes from experts.
3.  Revise the writing to make it clearer and more concise, avoiding wordy sentences and grammatical errors.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide specific reasons to support their answer. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the main issues is the presence of grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, the sentence ""I think to that there are famous companys"" should be ""I think that there are famous companies."" Additionally, the student often uses informal language and colloquial expressions, such as ""I show that I loose my money"" instead of ""I realized that I wasted my money.""

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences and basic phrases. For example, the sentence ""the trayectory and the knowledge of the company permits to identify if any product is better than other"" could be rephrased to ""the company's experience and knowledge enable us to identify which product is better.""

In terms of coherence, the student jumps between ideas and does not provide a clear structure to their essay. The introduction and conclusion are not well-connected, and the student fails to summarize their main points effectively. For instance, the final sentence ""There are products better than others jus in appareance, but people should say which product is better when they obtain it"" is unclear and does not provide a clear conclusion to the essay.

Despite these issues, the student attempts to provide specific examples to support their answer, such as the example of the oil and the toy company. However, these examples are not fully developed and could be improved with more detail and analysis.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. They have used a relevant example from Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani's life to illustrate the importance of taking risks and trying new things to achieve success. The student has also provided a clear thesis statement and has supported it with logical reasoning and examples.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For instance, the phrase ""add spice to life"" is a common idiom that could be replaced with a more nuanced expression. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific details about Mr. Ambani's experiences and the challenges he faced while taking risks.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and summarized the main points made in the essay. The final sentence, ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well,"" is a repetition of the thesis statement and could be omitted.

The student's grammar and sentence structure are generally clear, but there are some minor errors, such as the use of the phrase ""as we know"" which could be rephrased for more natural English.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides specific examples from their personal experiences in New York City and their studies in interior design to support their argument.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""hav broad knowlege,"" ""acadaic subjects,"" ""helful in society,"" and ""peolpe."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words like ""helpful"" and ""better."" The student could benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the topic is somewhat superficial. While they provide some specific examples, they do not fully explore the implications of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. For instance, they mention that every major is relative to each other, but they do not explain how this is the case or what specific benefits this has.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack variety, which makes the essay feel somewhat flat and unengaging.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, with numerous grammatical errors and typos throughout the essay. For instance, ""its"" should be ""it's,"" ""subjuct"" should be ""subject,"" ""knowege"" should be ""knowledge,"" and ""specefied"" should be ""specialized."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it challenging to understand the student's intended message.

In terms of content, the student has provided some relevant reasons to support their opinion, such as being able to discuss a subject in-depth and having better job opportunities. However, these points are not well-developed, and the student could have provided more specific examples and evidence to strengthen their arguments. For example, when discussing job opportunities, the student could have mentioned specific industries or companies that value specialized knowledge.

The student also attempts to address potential counterarguments, stating that broad knowledge is not necessarily bad, but this is not a convincing argument. A more effective approach would be to acknowledge the potential benefits of broad knowledge and then explain why they are outweighed by the benefits of specialization.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks organization and structure. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, providing both reasons for and against it. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The writer has effectively used specific examples to support their arguments, such as the example of the young person teaching older people how to use computers and the Internet. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of relevant examples to support the writer's arguments. For instance, the example of the young person teaching older people in the neighborhood is a concrete illustration of how young people can help their communities. The writer also shows an understanding of the impact of technology on young people's lives, highlighting how they may spend more time with machines than people.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""As I see it"" and ""In other words"" are overused and could be replaced with more complex sentence structures. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""usaing"" instead of ""using"" and ""neiborhood"" instead of ""neighborhood"".

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the statement. While the writer acknowledges that young people may not give enough time to helping their communities, they could have explored this idea further and provided more evidence to support their claim.

2. The writer tries to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""First of all,"" ""Second of all,"" and ""In short,"" which shows some attempt to organize their writing.
3. The writer attempts to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""satisfied,"" ""challenge,"" ""inventions,"" and ""fortunes,"" which shows some effort to use more complex vocabulary.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. They have provided some reasons and examples to support their answer, but there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has attempted to use specific examples from their own life to support their arguments. For instance, they mention that they were ""the richest"" when they were in high school, implying that they had more freedom and financial security at that time. They also mention their mother's health issues as an example of how older people may struggle with physical limitations.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow. The student jumps abruptly from discussing money to family to health, without providing a clear connection between the ideas. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Secondly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""Jobs may not be the prpfable ones but you still have to work for your family"" is unclear and contains a typo. Similarly, the sentence ""Just sitting at home won't be the best thing to do but what if there is no choice?"" is awkwardly phrased.

Thirdly, the student's arguments are not well-supported and often rely on generalizations. For example, they state that older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life, but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim. They also state that being young is a factor that older people cannot beat, but they do not explain why this is the case.

Finally, the student's conclusion is abrupt and does not summarize their main points effectively. They state that there will be times when older people can enjoy life, but they do not explain how this relates to their main argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two examples to support their opinion that it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. However, their argument is not well-structured, and the examples provided are not effectively linked to the main topic. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clarity in the thesis statement. The student starts by stating that it depends on the situation, which makes it difficult to understand their stance on the prompt. The essay then jumps to two examples, but they do not clearly explain how these examples support their initial statement. 

In the first example, the student mentions that soccer players from Brazil did not read textbooks in their childhood but still became good players. However, this example does not necessarily support the idea that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. In fact, it could be argued that these players developed their skills through experience and practice, which is a form of learning by doing.

The second example, about the student's experience with car engineering, is more relevant to the topic. However, the student's conclusion that understanding ideas is not enough is not well-supported. They mention that they thought they had enough knowledge of car engineering, but this does not necessarily mean that understanding ideas is not important. In fact, understanding the concepts of car engineering is crucial for safe and effective driving.

The student's writing also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, which makes it difficult to understand their intended meaning. For example, ""phycics"" should be spelled as ""physics,"" and ""thougt"" should be spelled as ""thought.""

The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, arguing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer presents two main reasons to support this claim: the heavy workload of students and the tendency of seeking personal benefits. The essay also acknowledges that there are some individuals who genuinely enjoy community service, but concludes that they are a minority.

Strengths:

1. The essay clearly states the thesis statement and supports it with two main reasons, which is a good structure for an essay.
2. The writer provides specific examples to illustrate the points, such as students having less leisure time due to heavy workload and preferring paid jobs over community service.
3. The essay attempts to acknowledge the counterargument that some individuals genuinely enjoy community service, showing a willingness to consider multiple perspectives.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""in this era of immense competition"" and ""sense of belonging has decreased over the years."" These phrases do not add much depth or originality to the argument.
2. The writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support the claims, such as statistics or specific examples of community service projects that have been affected by the decline in participation.
3. The essay could benefit from more nuanced language and sentence structure. For example, the writer often uses simple sentences and repetitive phrases, which can make the writing seem flat and unengaging.
4. The conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points or reiterate the thesis statement.

Evaluation:

The essay demonstrates a good effort from the student in addressing the prompt and providing some relevant points to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

Firstly, the student starts by acknowledging the vagueness of the terms ""young people"" and ""older people,"" which is a good point to make. However, the student then proceeds to define these terms in a somewhat arbitrary manner, which may not be universally accepted. For instance, the definition of ""young people"" as those in their teens may not be applicable to all cultures or contexts.

The student attempts to compare the advantages and disadvantages of young and old people, but the points made are not always well-supported or clearly linked to the topic. For example, the statement that young people have more time to develop their potential is a valid point, but it is not explicitly connected to the idea that young people enjoy life more. Similarly, the mention of physical ability as an advantage of young people is not clearly linked to the topic, and the example of physical strength is not a strong enough argument to support this point.

The student also raises a valid point about the experience and knowledge that older people accumulate over time, which is an important consideration when evaluating the enjoyment of life. However, this point is somewhat undermined by the student's later statement that they only have a ""view or taste"" of what it is to be young, which suggests a lack of consideration for the experiences and perspectives of older people.

The student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and relies on a somewhat vague statement about people's desire to stay young. This conclusion does not effectively tie together the various points made in the essay and does not provide a clear and convincing argument for why young people enjoy life more.

The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented in a logical order: making friends, being well-organized, and having more fun. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""In my personal experience, i agree"" (should be ""In my personal experience, I agree""), ""lots of friends"" (should be ""many friends""), ""commiuncate"" (should be ""communicate""), ""sarted"" (should be ""started""), and ""wil"" (should be ""will""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of phrases such as ""In this short essay"" and ""In my opinon."" Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""He/She could led you to the most popular and interesting place"" (should be ""He/She can lead you to the most popular and interesting places"").

Thirdly, the student's examples are somewhat anecdotal and lack depth. While the story about meeting a friend on a bus is relatable, it is not a strong argument for why traveling in a group is the best way to travel.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some relevant points about the impact of advertisements on people's perceptions of products. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow the argument.

One of the primary issues is the use of vague and grammatically incorrect sentences, which hinder the reader's understanding of the writer's intended message. For instance, the opening sentence, ""It is the reality that on one can change the reality. On the other hand, there is a good way to alter reality in our mind,"" is unclear and grammatically incorrect. The writer seems to be trying to make a point about the power of advertisements, but the sentence structure and vocabulary are not effective in conveying this idea.

The writer also struggles to provide specific examples to support their claims. While they mention that celebrities are used in advertisements, they fail to provide concrete evidence or statistics to back up this assertion. The example about Michael Jackson and Pepsi is an interesting one, but it is not well-developed or supported by any concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is often incorrect, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""withhout"" should be ""without,"" ""pejorative sepeciliaties"" should be ""negative specifications,"" and ""impoosible"" should be ""impossible.""

In terms of content, the writer touches on the idea that advertisements often hide negative aspects of products, but this point is not fully developed or supported. The writer mentions the example of microwave ovens, but fails to provide any concrete evidence or statistics to back up this claim.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. 

One of the primary issues is the student's writing style, which is often fragmented and lacks proper sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""Car companys pruducting a new car every year"" should be rewritten as ""Car companies are producing a new car every year."" This correction would improve the overall flow of the essay.

The student attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their disagreement with the statement. They mention the increasing population, the production of new cars, and the decreasing price of cars. However, these points are not well-developed or supported with concrete evidence. For example, the statement ""Government must solve this problem but nobody dont do anything"" is a vague assertion that lacks specific details or solutions.

The student also attempts to provide an example from Istanbul, but it is not well-integrated into the essay. The information about Istanbul's population and car ownership is interesting, but it is not clearly connected to the main argument. The student also makes a contradictory statement when they mention that ""electricity or wather is so free"" when discussing alternative energy sources for cars.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is also a concern. There are several spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, such as ""peoples"" instead of ""people,"" ""moch"" instead of ""much,"" and missing articles. Additionally, the student uses colloquial expressions like ""daily woks"" instead of ""daily work.""

In terms of content, the student touches on some relevant points, such as the need for alternative energy sources and the importance of public transportation. However, these ideas are not fully developed or supported with evidence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay lacks a clear and direct answer to the question, instead meandering through various points and examples. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by mentioning the changes in society due to historical events, but then shifts to the impact of capitalism and individualism on young people's behavior. While these points are relevant to the topic, they are not directly connected to the main question. The student also jumps between different ideas, such as the influence of the May 68 movement and the Tsunami, without a clear link between them.

The student's writing style is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""During the last years,"" instead of ""In recent years,"" and ""I will take for my exemple"" instead of ""I will use as an example."" Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, making the text difficult to follow at times.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and verb tense inconsistencies. For example, ""In the fast growing world job opportunities are growing"" should be ""In the fast-growing world, job opportunities are growing."" Additionally, ""Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well"" should be ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.""

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For instance, ""People always want money and reputation, at least one of them"" could be rephrased as ""People generally desire both financial gain and a good reputation."" Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. The example about the car mechanic is a good start, but it could be expanded upon to make it more convincing.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing earning money and reputation to people's attention, and then to being imaginative. A clearer transition between paragraphs would help to make the essay flow better.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some reasons and examples to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to make the essay more effective. 

Firstly, the introduction is somewhat unclear and lacks a direct response to the prompt. The student starts with a descriptive paragraph about children playing with toys, which, although related to the topic, does not directly address the statement. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's opinion and provided a thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, which affects the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. For instance, ""analize"" should be spelled as ""analyze,"" ""enyoy"" should be spelled as ""enjoy,"" and ""entusiastic"" should be spelled as ""enthusiastic."" Additionally, there are several instances of sentence fragments and run-on sentences, which make the text difficult to follow.

Thirdly, the student's analysis of the topic is somewhat superficial. While they mention some valid points, such as the worries of old people and the simplicity of children's lives, they do not provide a nuanced exploration of the topic. For example, they could have discussed the concept of happiness in more depth, considering factors such as personal fulfillment, relationships, and life experiences.

Lastly, the conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The student mentions that people often say they would like to be a child again, but this statement is not directly related to the main argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. They have used examples from mathematics and physics to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the transition from the mathematics example to the physics example is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentence structures. This results in a lack of sophistication in their writing. For example, the phrase ""If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth's surface, then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

Thirdly, the student's examples, although relevant, are not well-developed. The mathematics example is brief and lacks specific details, while the physics example is more detailed but still lacks a clear connection to the main argument. The student could have provided more concrete examples to support their claim.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear summary of their main points. They could have provided a more concise and effective conclusion that ties together their ideas.

2. They have provided a personal anecdote to support their argument, citing their own experience as a software engineer.
3. The student has attempted to use a quote to support their argument, although it is not directly related to the topic.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and logical flow. The student jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow their argument.
2. The writing is simplistic and lacks depth. The student relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""Jack of all, King of none.""
3. The student fails to provide concrete evidence to support their argument. While they mention the importance of specializing in one subject, they do not provide specific examples or data to back up this claim.
4. The essay lacks variety in sentence structure and vocabulary. The student relies on simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the writing seem flat and unengaging.
5. The student's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points.

Suggestions for improvement:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has taken a thoughtful approach to addressing the question. The essay begins with a valid point about the need to clarify the meaning of ""nowadays"" and ""helping their communities,"" which shows an attempt to address potential ambiguities in the prompt. However, the student's approach to addressing these issues is somewhat meandering and lacks focus.

The student provides a clear example of how living in a small town versus a big city can affect community involvement, which is a good attempt to provide specific reasons to support their answer. However, the example is not fully developed, and the student could have explored this idea further.

The student also raises a valid point about the meaning of ""helping their communities,"" but the explanation is somewhat unclear and could be more effectively developed. The student's conclusion is somewhat confusing, as they seem to be saying that young people give less time to helping their communities, but then attribute this to the society's selfishness rather than the young people themselves.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three main reasons in support of their agreement with the statement. However, the essay demonstrates some areas that require improvement in terms of language accuracy, coherence, and organization.

One of the primary concerns is the numerous grammatical errors and inaccuracies in sentence structure. For instance, ""we a very new to the place"" should be ""we are very new to the place,"" and ""if we a in a group there are very less change to get lost"" should be ""if we are in a group, there is very little chance to get lost."" Additionally, the use of ""preson"" instead of ""person"" and ""how is very familier"" instead of ""who is very familiar"" are examples of errors that detract from the overall clarity of the writing.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of traveling in a group to the importance of having a tour guide. A more logical connection between these ideas would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

The student also struggles to provide specific and detailed examples to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the benefits of having a tour guide, the writer simply states that the guide ""can help us to now the history of the place"" without providing any concrete examples or anecdotes.

Lastly, the essay could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. The writer relies heavily on simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the writing seem repetitive and lacking in depth.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and content. 

One of the major issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors, such as ""Nowsday,"" ""amny,"" ""o=in,"" and ""haver."" These errors make it challenging to understand the student's intended meaning, which negatively impacts the overall clarity of the essay. Furthermore, the student's writing lacks variety in sentence structure, resulting in a repetitive and monotonous tone.

In terms of content, the student has provided two main reasons to support their stance: the difficulty of studying multiple subjects and the ease of finding a job with specialized knowledge. However, the student's arguments are not well-supported with concrete examples or evidence. For instance, the example about the lack of people who know how to build cable in Canada is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a random statement.

The student also fails to address the potential benefits of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects, such as increased adaptability and a broader range of career opportunities. This omission makes their argument one-sided and less convincing.

To improve, the student should focus on revising their essay to address these issues. They should proofread their work to eliminate grammatical errors, vary their sentence structure, and provide more concrete examples to support their arguments.

These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's arguments are not well-supported by concrete examples.

For instance, the student states that understanding ideas and concepts helped them become a scientist, but they do not elaborate on how this occurred.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks cohesion and organization.

The examples given, such as traveling abroad and the ability to take risks, are relevant to the topic. However, the writer could have elaborated more on these points to provide a more comprehensive argument.

The student also fails to provide concrete examples to illustrate their points, relying on vague statements like ""Belief is good examples"" and ""Japanese students do not know real facts.""

The student's writing also lacks depth and nuance in their analysis. They oversimplify complex issues, such as the relationship between facts and understanding, and fail to consider alternative perspectives. For example, the student assumes that learning facts is the primary goal of education, without acknowledging the value of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

For instance, the student switches between the first person (""In my opinion"") and the third person (""companies try to reach so many people"") without a clear reason. This can make the essay seem disjointed and confusing.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, the phrase ""it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention"" could be rephrased to ""advertisements can be misleading for consumers who are not paying attention.""

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence are not always clear. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the ways companies attract consumers to discussing the role of big companies in world trade. A clearer transition between ideas would make the essay flow better.

However, the student does provide some good points, such as the use of famous people and illusions in advertisements, and the pressure on consumers to try products. They also mention that some advertisements reflect the true appearance and usage of a product, which is a valid point.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. However, the essay is marred by several grammatical and structural errors, which hinder the clarity and coherence of the argument.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the inconsistent use of verb tenses.

For instance, the student uses the present tense in the first sentence (""I am agree with the thing"") but then switches to the past tense in the next sentence (""To be successful mean you will success on every thing you try""). This inconsistency affects the overall flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic phrases and sentences. For example, the phrase ""I am good to play pianno"" is not a grammatically correct sentence, and the student could have used more descriptive language to convey their ideas. Additionally, the student's examples, although well-intentioned, are not particularly effective in supporting their argument. The examples are often vague and lack specific details, making it difficult to fully understand the student's point.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat unclear. They seem to be suggesting that trying new things and taking risks is essential for success, but they also imply that success is not solely dependent on trying new things. This ambiguity makes it challenging to fully understand the student's stance on the issue.

Despite these issues, the student has attempted to provide some supporting examples from their personal experiences, which shows a good effort to engage with the topic. However, these examples could be more effectively used to support the argument if they were presented in a clearer and more coherent manner.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, but their argument is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence. The essay starts by disagreeing with the statement, but the reasons provided are not well-supported and seem to be based on a personal preference rather than a logical analysis of the statement. The student's definition of success is narrow and focused on personal happiness and family life, which is not necessarily related to the original statement. The essay also contains several grammatical errors, such as ""for that one,"" ""one has to dedicate most of his or her time for that purpose,"" and ""make agood living out of it."" Additionally, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

The student does attempt to provide some examples, such as the idea that trying new things and taking risks might leave one with no time to enjoy success, but these examples are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence to support them. The student's conclusion is also somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points.

The student's writing style is also somewhat informal, with the use of colloquial expressions such as ""Definitely"" and ""instead of trying new things over and over again."" While this may be acceptable in informal writing, it is not suitable for an academic essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. They have provided two main reasons to support their opinion: the difficulty of navigating unfamiliar places and the importance of understanding historical context. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student has attempted to use specific examples to support their arguments, such as traveling to Latin American countries and visiting the Egyptian pyramids.
- They have demonstrated an understanding of the benefits of having a guide, including gaining a deeper understanding of local culture and history.
- The student has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""On the contrary"" and ""Having considered all the reasons given about.""

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""as we go to a new place, we may not be knowing how the place is"" (should be ""we may not know how the place is"") and ""you finnaly end up with the rocky structers you see there"" (should be ""you finally end up with the rocky structures you see there"").
- The student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""derive a lot of thrill and in turn a great happiness"" being overly simplistic.
- The student's use of examples could be more effective if they were more specific and detailed. For example, instead of simply stating that a guide can help you understand the history of the Egyptian pyramids, they could describe a specific instance where this was the case.

Strengths:

1.  The student has effectively used the definition of an advertisement to support their argument, highlighting its primary aim of increasing sales and making products more appealing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the statement. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has also provided various reasons and examples to support their answer, including the depletion of oil supplies, the need to reduce fuel consumption due to global warming, and the potential for alternative energy sources.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""to aspects,"" ""let say,"" ""alledge,"" and ""dicrease."" These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the overall coherence of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain unclear phrasing, such as ""the fact that a good part of the estimations we have tells us that the Earth oil supplies won't last forever."" A more precise and concise way to express this idea would be ""estimates suggest that the Earth's oil supplies will not last forever.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential impact of alternative energy sources on the car industry. While they mention the use of vegetable oil and hydrogen energy, they do not explore the potential challenges and limitations of these alternatives.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear, as they state that they personally believe there will be more cars in the future, but that they will be more respectful of the environment. This conclusion seems to contradict the initial statement, which suggests that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.

These errors detract from the overall coherence and professionalism of the essay.

In terms of content, the student provides some valid points, such as the use of celebrities in advertisements and the potential for false statements. However, the student's argument is somewhat inconsistent, as they initially express disagreement with the statement but later acknowledge that advertisements can be misleading. A clearer and more cohesive argument would strengthen the essay.

The student also attempts to provide counterarguments, such as the role of governing bodies like ISO in ensuring product authenticity. However, this point is not fully developed, and the student could have explored this idea further to provide more convincing evidence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and using examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""That is not completly true since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher becuase they have the financial resources"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Additionally, the transition between ideas could be smoother, making it easier to follow the student's train of thought.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For example, ""beucase"" should be ""because,"" ""porfit"" should be ""profit,"" and ""Cocal Cola"" should be ""Coca Cola."" These errors can be distracting and affect the overall impression of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's analysis of the example of Coca Cola is somewhat superficial. While they mention that the company took a huge leap of faith by investing in new products, they do not delve deeper into the potential risks involved or the impact of this decision on the company's success.

The student provides two historical examples to support their argument, including the Roman Catholic Church's false facts about the solar system and the Renaissance period's advancements in knowledge. 

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""hence forth,"" ""renassance period,"" and ""idomoms."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""One of the best examples to support this statement goes back in time before the renassance period in Europe."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""A notable example that supports this statement is the period in European history before the Renaissance.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of the ideas and concepts they are advocating for. For instance, they mention the importance of ""free thinking"" but do not elaborate on what this means or how it contributes to the development of new ideas and concepts.

Strengths:

1.  The writer begins by establishing their connection to their community, which helps to create a sense of authenticity and personal investment in the topic. This makes their argument more convincing and relatable.

The essay structure is coherent, and the writer has attempted to address the prompt's requirements. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes, which provide a relatable and engaging perspective on the topic. The writer's experience in the software industry and their realization of the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge are valuable insights that support their argument. Additionally, the writer has made an effort to provide concrete examples, such as the scenario of a computer scientist needing assistance from others in a project related to chemistry.

However, there are several areas that require attention. Firstly, the writer struggles with grammar and sentence structure, as evident in the use of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and awkward phrasing. For instance, the sentence ""At first glance, we may think that speacilazing in one subject is good for us as we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject"" could be rephrased for clarity and grammatical correctness. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from using more sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Another area for improvement is the organization and coherence of the essay. While the writer has attempted to address the prompt's requirements, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the ideas could be more fully developed. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge to stating that having broad knowledge of many subjects is beneficial for career advancement.

Lastly, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and balanced arguments. While they effectively argue that having broad knowledge is beneficial, they could also acknowledge potential drawbacks or counterarguments to strengthen their position.

For instance, the example about Diet Coke and the electronic machine for exercising at home could be expanded to provide more insight into how these advertisements create unrealistic expectations. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific details about how the computerizing of images in the cosmetics industry affects consumers' perceptions of products.

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat unclear and does not directly address the prompt. They start by asking if the statement is right or not, which is not a direct response to the prompt. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear stance on the statement and a thesis statement to guide the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of examples is somewhat inconsistent. They mention their grandmother's community as an example of a time when people were more involved in their community, but they do not provide enough context or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, they mention that their grandmother and other children in her age had to work a lot at home and on the field, which is not directly related to the statement.

Thirdly, the student's analysis of the situation is somewhat simplistic. They state that people in urban areas are more individualistic and isolated, which is a common stereotype, but they do not provide enough evidence to support this claim. They also do not consider other factors that may contribute to this phenomenon, such as the lack of community resources or social programs.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples from real-life scenarios, such as the history of McDonald's and the book ""Le Papillon."" These examples effectively illustrate the concept of taking risks and trying new things to achieve success. The writer has also demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided relevant quotes and descriptions to support their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several instances of incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, in the sentence ""It is not arguable that if one wants to be successful, one must seek for new things so that one can be differed from usual and common people,"" the writer uses the phrase ""seek for"" instead of ""seek out,"" and ""differed"" instead of ""distinguish themselves from."" Additionally, the writer often uses colloquial expressions and slang, such as ""it is not arguable,"" ""lucidly manifasted,"" and ""appealed clearly,"" which can make the writing seem informal and unpolished.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the examples they provided. For instance, in the case of McDonald's, the writer could have explored the potential risks and challenges that Ray Kroc faced in implementing the ""fast food"" concept, and how he overcame them.

Furthermore, the student's second point about companies losing reputation is not clearly connected to the original statement.

Thirdly, the student's third point about excessive advertisement being prohibited in their country is not relevant to the original statement. The student's example about food expiration dates is also unclear and does not directly relate to the topic.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""cocnepts"" instead of ""concepts,"" ""it is important for every student to understand anything rather than learning it,"" and ""clearily"" instead of ""clearly."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning or concrete examples. The essay relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""it is important for every student to understand anything rather than learning it."" The student fails to provide specific instances or explanations to illustrate their point, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks clarity and organization. The essay jumps between ideas without a clear transition, making it challenging to follow the student's argument. The use of phrases such as ""the main idea of the essay is"" is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the essay.

However, the student does attempt to address the prompt and provides some relevant points, such as the importance of understanding ideas and concepts before learning facts. They also mention the role of schools and colleges in facilitating this understanding.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. The essay is written in a coherent and logical manner, with the student presenting both sides of the argument and providing specific examples to support their claim. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases and connect their ideas effectively. For instance, the student uses phrases such as ""In this modern society,"" ""Maybe, in my opinion,"" and ""At this point"" to link their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's grammar and spelling are not perfect, with several errors throughout the essay. For example, ""peolple"" should be spelled as ""people,"" ""toghether"" should be spelled as ""together,"" and ""alder"" should be spelled as ""older."" Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with some words being used incorrectly or in an unnatural way. For instance, ""product"" should be spelled as ""produce"" in the sentence ""All those opportunities however product smiles and older people feel relax.""

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is sometimes superficial. While they mention that young people can enjoy life with more sports, they do not provide any specific examples or details to support this claim. Similarly, the student mentions that older people can enjoy life by spending time in the park or playing cards, but they do not elaborate on why these activities are enjoyable or how they contribute to a fulfilling life.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and lacks a strong final statement. The student mentions that they are a young boy with many wishes and that these wishes are a way to enjoy life, but they do not explicitly state their opinion on the original statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, expressing disagreement and providing reasons to support their argument. However, the essay contains several areas that require improvement in terms of language accuracy, coherence, and organization.

One of the major strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide examples and reasons to support their argument. They mention the development of alternative fuels, such as propane and other gases, and the potential for cars to be powered by these substances in the future. Additionally, the student acknowledges the environmental concerns associated with car usage but expresses skepticism about the likelihood of significant change in the next twenty years.

However, the essay is marred by several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. For instance, the student uses colloquial expressions (""itre"", ""dont"", ""dont really think""), and there are numerous instances of subject-verb agreement errors (""cars have shown to be a very likely product to be sell""). The essay also lacks coherence, with ideas and sentences that seem disconnected from one another.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from providing more concrete evidence and data to support their claims. While they mention the growth of car sales in developed countries, they fail to provide specific statistics or examples to illustrate this point. Additionally, the student's skepticism about the environmental impact of cars is not adequately supported by evidence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the argument. The student has provided various instances, such as older people being unable to participate in adventure sports, having difficulty adopting new things, and experiencing physical limitations, to illustrate why young people enjoy life more. Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Ever wondered why all the players, workers, etc. retire after a certain age?"" effectively engages the reader and encourages them to think critically about the topic.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing style is often simplistic and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack descriptive language, making the essay feel somewhat flat. For example, the sentence ""It's easier for younger people to adopt new things but it is quite difficult for old people to do the same"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging and descriptive.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Its easier for younger people to adopt new things"" should be ""It is easier for younger people to adopt new things."" Additionally, the student's use of transitions between paragraphs is not always smooth, making the essay feel disjointed at times.

In terms of content, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and balanced perspectives. While the essay focuses primarily on the limitations of older people, it would be beneficial to acknowledge the potential advantages of aging, such as wisdom, life experience, and a greater appreciation for life.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized the thesis statement in a more convincing manner.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. However, their writing exhibits some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a clear thesis statement and support it with a relevant example. The example of children studying is a good illustration of how facts can lead to various ideas and concepts. The student also attempts to explain their opinion by comparing it to the relationship between practice and theory.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""is a general rule that from the facts the ideas or concepts is getting"" (should be ""is a general rule that facts lead to ideas and concepts"") and ""diferents"" (should be ""different""). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""for students are more important"" (should be ""for students, it is more important"") and ""in some measure is how the situation has been developed"" (should be ""in some ways, the situation has developed"").

Furthermore, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay lacks cohesion. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of facts to providing an example, without a clear connection between the two ideas. The conclusion also feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay, as it reiterates the importance of understanding facts without summarizing the main points.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The writer provides three main reasons to support this statement, including the potential for innovative ideas and insights, the need to adapt to changing circumstances, and the importance of risk-taking for economic growth.

Strengths of the essay include:

* The writer provides specific examples from notable figures such as Einstein and Bill Gates to support their argument, which helps to make the essay more engaging and credible.
* The writer attempts to address potential counterarguments, such as the idea that doing what one already knows how to do well is sufficient, by providing examples of how technological advancements have made traditional methods obsolete.
* The writer uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

Weaknesses of the essay include:

* The writer struggles with grammar and spelling errors, such as ""somtines"" instead of ""sometimes"" and ""preapared"" instead of ""prepared"".

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, providing three examples to support their argument that there will be more cars in use in twenty years. However, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow, making it challenging to follow at times. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of precise vocabulary.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's ability to think critically about the topic and provide examples from various industries, such as the tire and fuel industries. The student's use of specific companies like Goodyear, Pirelli, Mobil, and BP is also commendable. However, the examples are not thoroughly developed, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

The student's writing is often unclear, with sentences such as ""It is no likely to happen because automobiles represent a huge engine for today's economy and some people won't let their gold mine to be closed."" The phrase ""gold mine"" is used incorrectly, and the sentence lacks coherence. Additionally, the student's use of phrases like ""aloud car circulation"" and ""mennaced"" demonstrates a lack of precision in vocabulary.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The final sentence, ""In fact, I think  in twenty years the economic pressure around the car related industries and economic fields will not only impede the decrease, but will boost the automobile use,"" is a repetition of the main argument and lacks a clear conclusion.

The essay is well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, making the essay easy to follow.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples and reasons to support their argument. For instance, they mention the increasing number of accidents attributed to speeding young people in Bahrain, which is a concrete example of how the current state of driving contributes to the demand for cars. Additionally, the student highlights the importance of cars in providing privacy and efficiency, which is a valid point.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the demand for cars. For example, they mention that new roads are being built, but they could have explored the implications of this on car usage in more depth. Furthermore, the student could have provided more evidence to support their claim that people cannot give up on cars due to the privacy and efficiency it provides.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three main reasons to support their opinion that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""to specializde,"" ""corpenter,"" and ""It is vey important reasons."" These errors make it challenging to understand the student's intended meaning. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion.

Secondly, the student's arguments are not well-supported with specific examples. While they mention that specializing in one subject is useful for getting a job, they fail to provide concrete evidence to back up this claim. For instance, they only mention being a carpenter as an example, but do not explain how specializing in carpentry would be more beneficial than having broad knowledge.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. They simply state that having broad knowledge takes more time to learn and is expensive, without providing any supporting evidence or exploring the potential benefits of having broad knowledge.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps directly into discussing the importance of cars without providing a clear argumentative framework.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, which affects the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The essay is well-structured, and the student has made an effort to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the major issues is the presence of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and incorrect use of articles. For instance, the student writes ""In twenty years of time the number of cars in use will be in fewer number than there are today"" instead of ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" This error affects the clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences and phrases. For example, the sentence ""A car can effectively work for Maximum of fifteen years"" could be rephrased to ""A car can effectively work for a maximum of fifteen years"" to improve clarity and grammar.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and organization. Some sentences are fragmented or lack a clear connection to the previous sentence. For instance, the transition from discussing the government's measures to reduce pollution to the demand for petroleum products is abrupt.

However, the student has attempted to provide relevant examples to support their argument, such as the increasing traffic congestion and the problem of obesity. These examples demonstrate an understanding of the potential factors that could lead to a decrease in the number of cars in use.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, but their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with numerous grammatical errors, such as ""Its"" instead of ""It's,"" ""knoeledge"" instead of ""knowledge,"" and ""mike"" instead of ""might."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it challenging to understand the student's intended message.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is somewhat relevant but not well-developed. The example of painkillers is an attempt to illustrate the dangers of limited knowledge, but it is not fully explored. The student fails to provide a clear connection between the example and the broader argument, leaving the reader wondering how this example supports their stance.

The student also attempts to incorporate quotes, but they are not effectively integrated into the essay. The quotes seem to be added as afterthoughts rather than being organically woven into the text. This disrupts the flow of the essay and makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

The student's writing also lacks depth and nuance. The essay relies heavily on clichés, such as ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" and ""A man of all trades is master of none."" While these quotes are relevant to the topic, they are not analyzed or interpreted in any meaningful way. The student fails to provide a thoughtful and original perspective on the topic.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat confusing. The phrase ""Christmas comes but once a year"" seems unrelated to the topic and appears to be a non-sequitur. The student's advice to ""try to educate your self in every thing"" is also unclear and contradicts the earlier statement about not being a master of all trades.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used specific examples to support their argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide a clear and concise description of the lifestyles of young and older people. The writer has effectively highlighted the differences between the two groups, such as the tendency of young people to be stressed and rushed, while older people tend to enjoy a more relaxed pace of life.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their argument. For instance, the writer mentions that young people enjoy activities such as meeting friends, going out, and listening to music, but could have elaborated on how these activities contribute to their enjoyment of life. Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples of how older people enjoy their lives, such as engaging in hobbies or spending time with family.

Another area for improvement is the writer's use of language and grammar. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""In order to compare the lives of young people and older ones, it seems necessay to start off with a brief description of that average young and the average older person"" (should be ""It seems necessary to start off with a brief description of the average young person and the average older person""). The writer could also benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to express their ideas.

Finally, the writer could have provided a more convincing conclusion to the essay. While the writer argues that young and older people enjoy life in different ways, they could have provided more evidence to support this claim and avoided the statement ""Still one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotypes here; there might still be a lot of people at all ages that don't enjoy their lives."" This statement seems to undermine the writer's argument and could have been omitted.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given prompt, and their essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that traveling in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel.
2. They have used some relevant examples from their personal experience, such as traveling in India, to support their argument.
3. The student has attempted to address potential counterarguments, such as the risk of losing someone in the group, and provided a solution to this problem.

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with several sentences being disconnected and difficult to follow.
2. The use of vocabulary is limited, with many words being misspelled or used incorrectly (e.g., ""inscriptions,"" ""relish,"" ""involutary,"" ""inrtrigue,"" ""usaually"").
3. The student has not fully developed their ideas, with many sentences being simplistic and lacking supporting evidence.
4. The essay lacks variety in sentence structure, with many sentences being simple and lacking complexity.
5. The student has not provided a clear conclusion to summarize their main points and reiterate their stance on the topic.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Revise the essay to improve coherence and clarity by connecting ideas and sentences more effectively.
2. Expand vocabulary and use more precise language to convey ideas.
3. Develop ideas more fully by providing more supporting evidence and examples.
4. Vary sentence structure to create more complex and engaging sentences.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, and the writer provides some relevant points to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the idea that people in challenging environments are more likely to be distinguished and become successful. The writer also attempts to explain the benefits of taking risks, such as breaking the routine and increasing motivation.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices (e.g., ""conducted"" instead of ""conducts"", ""distinguished from"" instead of ""distinguished in"", ""fullfill"" instead of ""fulfill"", etc.). Additionally, the writer's sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, making the text seem a bit flat.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations to support their points. For example, when discussing the benefits of taking risks, the writer could have provided more specific examples of how this leads to success, rather than just stating it as a general fact. Additionally, the writer could have addressed potential counterarguments to their position, which would have added depth and complexity to the essay.

Finally, the writer's conclusion is a bit abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have restated the thesis statement and provided a final thought or call to action.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main reasons in support of the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The essay demonstrates some understanding of the benefits of having a tour guide, including the provision of additional information and the ability to experience local culture and special things.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the introduction is weak and lacks a clear thesis statement. The student starts by sharing a personal experience, which is not directly related to the prompt. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's position on the statement and provided a roadmap for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Threfore"" instead of ""Therefore,"" ""amout"" instead of ""amount,"" and ""Janapnese"" instead of ""Japanese."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and could be more effectively integrated into the essay. While the example about the bench in Guell Park is interesting, it is not fully developed, and the student could have explored the significance of this information further. Similarly, the example about the restaurant is more anecdotal and does not provide a clear connection to the main argument.

Lastly, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have restated the thesis statement and provided a final thought on the importance of tour guides.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of precise vocabulary. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to provide specific examples to support their arguments. While they mention various subjects like literature, arts, science, and technology, they fail to explain how these subjects are interconnected or how having broad knowledge of these subjects can be beneficial in real-life situations. 

Furthermore, the student's writing is often repetitive, with phrases like ""we should have a knowledge about various academic subjects"" appearing multiple times. This repetition makes the essay seem monotonous and lacks depth. Additionally, the student's use of phrases like ""we should not missuse this scientific knowledge"" and ""we should use our great knowledge for developing the welfare of our country"" seems to be a generic statement rather than a well-thought-out argument.

The student does attempt to provide some examples, such as the case of engineering and IT professionals moving into the software field, but this example is not fully developed and lacks context.

To improve, the student should focus on providing clear and concise arguments, using specific examples to support their claims, and organizing their essay in a logical and coherent manner.

In terms of content, the student has attempted to provide two main reasons for disagreeing with the statement. The first reason, regarding the development of new transportation systems in metropolitan areas, is somewhat plausible, but the student fails to provide concrete evidence to support this claim. The second reason, regarding the increasing population in developing countries, is more convincing, but the student could have elaborated further on this point.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of examples to support their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the poor sentence structure and grammar. The student often uses incomplete sentences, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the first sentence, ""It is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts which were once stated by the people itself,"" is unclear and contains a grammatical error (""itself"" should be ""themselves""). 

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is limited and lacks depth. While they mention the sun rising in the east and an apple falling down, these examples are not effectively linked to the main argument. The student fails to explain how understanding ideas and concepts led to the discovery of these facts. Additionally, the examples seem to be randomly inserted and do not flow logically within the essay.

The student also struggles to provide a clear and concise thesis statement. The essay jumps between different ideas, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the student starts by stating that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, but then shifts to discussing the importance of research and studying a particular topic.

However, the student does attempt to address the prompt and provides some relevant points, such as the idea that facts are ""just a single line statements that can be learned by anyone"" and that understanding concepts is necessary to reach a deeper understanding.

The student has made a clear attempt to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement and supporting it with examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear and could be more effectively stated. The student initially disagrees with the statement but later concludes that one can be successful either way, which seems to contradict their initial stance. A more precise thesis statement would help to guide the reader's understanding of the essay's direction.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps between different ideas without a clear logical flow. The student starts by providing a personal anecdote about a friend, then shifts to a general statement about treating people equally, and finally returns to the idea of taking risks. A more cohesive structure would help to connect these ideas and make the essay more engaging.

The student's use of examples is a strength, as they provide specific instances to support their arguments. However, the examples could be more effectively analyzed and explained. For instance, the student mentions their friend's experience, but does not fully explore the implications of this story or how it relates to the statement.

Furthermore, the student's language and grammar require improvement. There are several errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and vocabulary usage. For example, ""Todays people"" should be ""Today's people,"" and ""he developed bad grades and has to retake classes"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating their thesis. A more concise and well-supported conclusion would leave a stronger impression on the reader.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, providing both arguments for and against the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer presents two main points: first, that many young people are self-centered and forget the help they received from their communities, and second, that there are instances where young people do actively help their communities.

Strengths:

1.  The writer attempts to provide specific examples to support their arguments, such as the case of a student in the United States and the example of Non-Resident Indians helping charity organizations in India. These examples show that the writer is trying to engage with the topic and provide concrete evidence.
2.  The writer acknowledges that their initial statement may not be universally true, which demonstrates an attempt to consider multiple perspectives and nuances in the topic.
3.  The writer's language is generally clear, and they attempt to use basic grammar and sentence structures.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with errors such as ""In these modern times, youth are always bothered about achieving thieir individual goals and fullfiling their needs"" (should be ""achieving their individual goals and fulfilling their needs"") and ""Often,Youth  benefit from a  communtiy"" (should be ""Often, youth benefit from a community"").

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the statement ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used specific examples to support their argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of vivid descriptions and examples to illustrate the point. The writer effectively uses the example of the car advertisement on Mount St. Michel to show how advertisements can be misleading. Additionally, the writer highlights the issue of food products being presented in an exaggerated manner, which is a common problem in the advertising industry.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer could have provided more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the impact of advertisements to talking about the art of marketing. A smoother transition would have made the essay flow better.

Secondly, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While the examples provided are good, they are not enough to fully convince the reader of the writer's argument. For instance, the writer mentions that marketing is one of the finest and most expensive businesses, but they do not provide any concrete statistics or data to back up this claim.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion could be more effective. The writer's suggestion that we should not question the reliability of advertisements and just enjoy the ""glittering tale"" seems to undermine their initial argument. A more effective conclusion would have re-emphasized the importance of being critical of advertisements and the need for consumers to be aware of their potential biases.

For instance, the first sentence ""Whethere most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question"" should be rephrased to ""Whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question."" Additionally, the student uses informal language and colloquial expressions such as ""majour"" instead of ""major"" and ""pruduct"" instead of ""product.""

Furthermore, the student's ideas are not well-organized and lack depth. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the purpose of advertisements to providing examples and then to mentioning rules that govern advertisements. A more logical structure would be to introduce the topic, provide examples, and then conclude with a summary of the main points.

The student's use of examples is also limited and could be more effective if they were more specific and detailed. For instance, instead of simply stating that a toy was ""static"" and had ""bad color,"" the student could describe the specific toy and how it failed to meet their expectations.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people give enough time to helping their communities. However, their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the introduction, which fails to directly address the prompt. The student starts by mentioning the impact of technology on daily life, which is not directly related to the topic of community service. This diversion makes it challenging for the reader to understand the student's stance on the prompt.

The student attempts to provide examples to support their argument, but these examples are not well-integrated into the essay. For instance, the student mentions that technology has made people more alone, but this point is not clearly connected to the main topic. Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""I am sure there will be invented more things later"" and ""I personally define it as 'bad'"" suggests a lack of sophistication in their writing.

On the other hand, the student attempts to highlight the ease of helping others through technology, which is a valid point. However, this idea is not fully developed, and the student fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim.

However, the essay lacks coherence, organization, and effective use of language, which are essential for a well-written essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The student starts by stating their agreement with the statement but fails to provide a clear and focused thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The essay meanders through various points without a clear connection between them.

The student attempts to provide two reasons for their stance, but these reasons are not well-supported with evidence or examples. The first reason, which emphasizes the enjoyment of studying multiple subjects, is not a strong argument for having broad knowledge. The second reason, which highlights the utility of various subjects, is more convincing but still lacks specific examples to support the claim.

The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""I think it is nice way to study many academic subjects"" (should be ""I think it is a nice way""), ""the goodest job"" (should be ""the best job""), and ""it is all important, we can know how fun it is"" (should be ""it is all important, and we can know how fun it is""). Additionally, the student uses simple sentences and lacks variety in sentence structure, which makes the essay seem flat and unengaging.

Furthermore, the student fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a nuanced discussion of the topic. The essay is overly simplistic and lacks depth, which is a common challenge for second language learners.

The writer has attempted to address both economic and environmental concerns related to the increasing number of cars.

Strengths:

1.  The student has effectively used transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs, making the essay easy to follow.
2.  The writer has provided specific examples, such as the extraction of oil in Alaska and the North Sea, to support their argument about the rising oil prices.
3.  The student has also mentioned the impact of pollution on the environment and the potential consequences of increased car usage.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that it is essential for students to learn facts in addition to understanding ideas and concepts. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of examples to support the argument. The student provides a relatable scenario where a student who focuses only on understanding ideas and concepts may struggle to find a job after graduation. This example effectively illustrates the importance of learning facts in real-life situations.

Another positive aspect is the student's attempt to address the opposing viewpoint. They acknowledge that learning facts can help students understand ideas and concepts, making the learning process more engaging. This shows that the student has considered multiple perspectives and is able to think critically.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, ""In these society"" should be ""In this society,"" ""konwledge"" should be ""knowledge,"" and ""out sklls"" should be ""our skills."" These errors make the essay difficult to read and understand.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic phrases and sentence structures. For example, ""The two con not be without in the process to study"" should be ""The two cannot be without each other in the learning process."" This lack of varied vocabulary and sentence structure makes the essay seem less sophisticated.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of learning facts to explaining how facts can help students understand ideas and concepts. A clearer connection between the ideas would make the essay flow better.

The essay is well-structured, with three main reasons provided to support the opinion. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided specific examples to support their opinion, such as the case of creams that may harm the skin despite their advertised benefits, and the example of phone contracts with hidden costs.
2. The student has attempted to address the counterargument that advertisements are necessary to sell products, and has provided a valid point that producers need to present their products in a good light to compete with other companies.
3. The student has also mentioned the importance of independent testing and reviews to reveal the hidden characteristics of products.

Weaknesses:

1. Grammar and vocabulary errors are prevalent throughout the essay, such as ""I think that almost every advertisment"" (should be ""I think that almost every advertisement""), ""the main use of advertisment"" (should be ""the main purpose of advertising""), and ""merrits"" (should be ""merits"").
2. Sentence structure is sometimes awkward, such as ""In order to sell products the producer has to display it in a good light, because otherwise similar products from other companies will be bought."" (could be rephrased for better clarity).

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but there are areas that require improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. The writer attempts to provide reasons to support their opinion, but some points lack clarity and depth. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to express their opinion and provide some relevant examples. For instance, they mention that young people have more freedom and can spend their time in various ways, which is a valid point. However, the writer could have elaborated on this idea by providing more specific examples or details.

On the other hand, the writer's argument is weakened by some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. For example, they state that old people are ""more mature"" because they have had many experiences, which is a true statement, but it does not necessarily mean that they enjoy life more. Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

Furthermore, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""dont"" instead of ""don't,"" ""freedom"" instead of ""freedom,"" and ""beutiful"" instead of ""beautiful."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing personal anecdotes to support their agreement with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the introduction lacks clarity and a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating their opinion without providing a concise explanation of why they agree with the statement. A more effective introduction would have included a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay seem disjointed. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing their own experience to their parents' experience without providing a clear link between the two. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary is basic, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""eagering"" should be ""eager to,"" and ""swore not to buy any bags through the Internet anymore"" is a bit informal and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is lacking. They simply reiterate their agreement with the statement without summarizing the main points or providing a final thought.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support this claim, such as the focus on positive aspects of products, the omission of negative approaches, and the use of visual effects to attract consumers.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement, which makes it difficult to understand the student's main argument. The sentence ""Advertisement is the most important item and vehicle of the marketing"" is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a general statement. A more focused and specific thesis statement would have helped to guide the reader through the essay.

Secondly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""It is obvious that, most of the people have faced a problem with one of the producs they purchased"" (missing article and incorrect spelling of ""products""). Additionally, there are instances of word order errors, such as ""owing to the competition, the producers try to not announce the all instructions of the product througth the advertisements"" (incorrect word order and missing article).

Thirdly, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their claims. While they mention the use of visual effects, they do not provide specific examples of advertisements that have misled consumers.

Lastly, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The student mentions the need for the competition and consumer boards to control advertisements, but this seems to be a separate issue from the main topic.

They provide personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument, showcasing their ability to think critically and reflect on their own experiences.

Strengths:

1. The student begins by providing a broad context, mentioning the diversity of travelers and the importance of preparation for a trip. This sets the stage for their argument and engages the reader.
2. They effectively use personal experiences to illustrate their point, such as the guided tour of Paris, which highlights the limitations of following a predetermined itinerary.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and supporting it with various reasons and examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a clear thesis statement and support it with relevant examples. For instance, the student mentions the growing price of petrol, environmental concerns, and the importance of cars in developing countries as reasons why the number of cars might decrease in certain regions. Additionally, the student provides specific examples, such as the prohibition of cars in the center of London and the potential implementation of similar measures in Paris, to support their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For example, the sentence ""because of thism the price of petrole is growing and growing"" should be ""because of this, the price of petrol is growing and growing."" Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repeated use of words such as ""very"" and ""important"" without much variation.

Furthermore, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the decrease in car numbers in Europe and the US to the potential conflict between environmental protectors and car constructors. A clearer transition between paragraphs would help to improve the flow of the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat vague and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought on the topic.

The student's essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their ideas and address the prompt. 

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear and contradicts the prompt. The prompt asks for an agreement or disagreement with the statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."" However, the student's essay argues that it is more important to learn facts, which is the opposite of the prompt. This confusion may stem from a misunderstanding of the prompt or a lack of clarity in the thesis statement.

Secondly, the student provides three reasons to support their argument, but they are not well-developed and lack concrete examples. The first reason, which compares the ability to learn facts and understand concepts, is unclear and uses vague terms like ""specifiction"" and ""abstruction."" The example about distinguishing a high-value picture from a low-value one is also confusing and does not effectively illustrate the point.

The second reason, which states that it is easier for students to learn from teachers than by themselves, is a valid point, but it is not well-supported. The example about part-time jobs providing interpersonal skills is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a tangent.

The third reason, which argues that understanding ideas and concepts are essential for academic subjects, is a good point, but it is not well-integrated into the rest of the essay. The student seems to be trying to argue both sides of the issue, which can make the essay confusing.

Finally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. These errors can make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, providing two main reasons to support their argument: the depletion of oil resources and environmental pollution caused by gasoline. The essay structure is simple, with a clear introduction, two body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of transitional phrases, such as ""On the other hand"" and ""Therefore,"" which help to connect the ideas between paragraphs. The student also attempts to use rhetorical devices, like the phrase ""we should enjoy driving as long as we still can fuel our cars and before it turns into a luxury!"" to emphasize the urgency of the situation.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""we do have to remember that most cars need gas to go ahead"" (should be ""go ahead"" is not necessary here, and ""need"" should be ""require"") and ""whose quantities on our planet is definitely not endless"" (should be ""whose quantities on our planet are definitely not endless""). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases like ""we won't be able to afford them in a close future"" (should be ""in the near future"") and ""we are talking here of the Mankind's survival"" (should be ""we are talking about the survival of mankind"").

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is limited, and the essay could benefit from more specific and concrete evidence to support their arguments. For instance, the student mentions that ""we are likely to get into troubles very soon"" but does not provide any specific examples of the consequences of environmental pollution.

Finally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student's final sentence, ""Thus I hope we will be wise enough to reduce our pollution and preventing our children dying from asthma!"" is a non-sequitur and does not provide a clear conclusion to the essay.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides examples from various contexts, including a medical professional discovering new medicines and students who achieve academic success through taking risks.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is often simplistic, with a lack of complex sentence structures and vocabulary. For instance, the sentence ""No matter successful people or normal people, they all need to try new things and take risks"" could be rephrased for more nuance. Additionally, the student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""If they only do what they already know, they are learning nothing,"" which could be supported with more specific evidence.

The student's use of examples is a strength, but some of the connections between the examples and the statement could be more explicit. For example, the transition between the discussion of the medical professional and the students who take risks in their studies feels abrupt. Furthermore, the student's personal anecdote about studying in America is an interesting addition, but it could be more effectively integrated into the essay to support the main argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument. The writer's opinion on the topic is unclear, as they seem to be discussing the potential for flying cars in the future rather than addressing the original statement about the number of cars in use. The essay is also marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, and a lack of logical connections between ideas.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the writer's failure to provide a clear stance on the original statement. The student starts by mentioning flying cars, which is not relevant to the prompt. The writer then shifts to discussing the current status of cars as a symbol of status and the dangers of driving, but this does not directly address the original statement. The essay also includes several unrelated ideas, such as the history of the Vespa and the importance of freedom, which do not contribute to the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is often imprecise, with errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""A car was the symbol of a generation, our parents remember their first car like a realized dream"" is grammatically incorrect, and the phrase ""money are ghosts"" is a nonsensical expression.

Despite these issues, the student does attempt to provide some supporting evidence, such as the example of the Vespa and the idea that cars can provide freedom. However, these ideas are not developed or supported in a clear and logical manner.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their personal preference for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of language, which are essential for a well-written essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating their preference for specializing in one subject but fails to provide a clear explanation or justification for this preference. The essay meanders through various points without a logical connection between them.

The student attempts to provide reasons for specializing in one subject, such as becoming a professional and knowledgeable in that subject, being successful, and challenging oneself. However, these points are not well-supported with concrete examples or evidence. For instance, the example provided about studying engineering for a master's degree is more of a personal anecdote than a convincing argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Consentrating"" instead of ""Concentrating,"" ""mach"" instead of ""much,"" and ""quiet"" instead of ""quite."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and coherence. Many sentences are short and lack connection to the previous or next sentence, making the essay feel disjointed. Additionally, the student uses phrases like ""it is better to stick with one subject than being confused with many subjects which will you forget in the future,"" which is unclear and lacks coherence.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Very often, people who managed to succeed in life like to discover new things"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""the problem with this approche"" (typo). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""all for the purpose of always aiming higher"" and ""these limits extand"" being awkwardly phrased.

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be more nuanced and developed. For example, in the first body paragraph, the student states that taking risks can lead to losing everything, but this is not a convincing argument, as it is a potential consequence rather than a universal truth. In the second body paragraph, the student provides a good example of the importance of taking risks in medicine, but the connection to the topic is not explicitly made.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The final sentence, ""But if i had to choose, i would probably decide to take the risks, because the world wouldn't be were it is today without our will to discover and to master,"" is a good summary of the student's stance, but it could be more effectively integrated into the conclusion.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with numerous grammatical errors and typos that make it challenging to understand their intended meaning. For instance, the sentence ""The young people they can paly more thing then the old people because they still young and the can do something crazy because they dont even know is that right thing to do or not"" is unclear and difficult to decipher.

Furthermore, the student's argument is based on simplistic and stereotypical assumptions about young and old people. They claim that young people enjoy life more because they are young and can do crazy things, while old people enjoy life more because they have money and don't need to work hard. These generalizations are not supported by evidence and oversimplify the complexities of human experience.

The student also fails to provide specific examples to support their claims, relying instead on vague statements and personal opinions. For example, they mention that young people kill themselves, but do not provide any context or explanation for this phenomenon. This lack of depth and analysis makes their argument unconvincing.

However, the student does attempt to acknowledge the diversity of human experience and the subjective nature of enjoyment, stating that ""everyone are different, so can't say which kind people are mpre enjoy they life or not is you own think to change your mind."" This is a valuable insight, but it is not developed further in the essay.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides specific examples to support the writer's opinion. The writer effectively uses their personal experience as an undergraduate and graduate student at The American University in Cairo (AUC) to illustrate how young people are devoting time to help their communities. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.

Strengths:

1. The writer provides specific examples of how AUCians help their small community, such as organizing orientation groups for new students and fundraising for various activities.
2. The writer highlights the role of different clubs at AUC, such as the help club, cancer club, and hand in hand club, which demonstrate the young students' dedication to serving their large community.
3. The writer uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and paragraphs, making the essay flow smoothly.

Weaknesses:

1. The writer could improve sentence structure and grammar, particularly in the first paragraph, where some sentences are wordy and difficult to follow.
2. Some sentences lack clarity, such as ""In this regard, and based upon my experience as undergraduate and graduate student at The American University in Cairo (AUC), I would state that it is my belief that young people are actually devoting enough time to develop and make life better in their small and large communities."" This sentence could be rephrased for better clarity.
3. The writer could provide more depth and analysis of the examples provided, rather than simply stating them as facts.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, but their argument is largely based on assumptions and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. The essay starts with a strong statement about the current dominance of cars as a primary mode of personal transportation, but fails to provide a convincing argument for why this will continue to be the case in twenty years.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of consideration for alternative modes of transportation. The student dismisses the possibility of alternative transportation methods being developed within the next twenty years, citing the need for ""anti-gravity saucers or teleportation a-la' star trek"" as an unrealistic scenario. However, this is a straw man argument, as the prompt does not require the student to consider such extreme alternatives. A more nuanced discussion of potential alternatives, such as public transportation, cycling, or electric vehicles, would have strengthened the student's argument.

The essay also relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""the human population growing and will continue to grow twenty years down the line"" and ""driving a car is now an integral part of human culture, like riding a horse."" These statements do not provide any new insights or evidence to support the student's argument.

Furthermore, the student's use of language and grammar is often inaccurate, with errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. For example, ""poeple"" instead of ""people,"" ""currenlty"" instead of ""currently,"" and ""effecient"" instead of ""efficient.""

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement and supporting it with reasons and examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. The sentence ""This is very difficult question for me, because I am a one of the young people who do not have a relation with my community, so I copletely agree with this opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities"" is not a strong opening. It would be more effective to start with a hook that grabs the reader's attention and then clearly state the thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""copletely,"" ""resons,"" ""contuct,"" and ""occures."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Additionally, there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as ""the horrible actidents occures recently."" The student should strive to use more precise vocabulary and sentence structures.

Thirdly, the student's supporting paragraphs lack coherence and logical flow. The first paragraph jumps abruptly from discussing the lack of opportunities to interact with neighbors to a historical example from Japan. The second paragraph introduces a new idea about the generation gap, but it is not clearly connected to the main argument. The student should work on organizing their ideas more effectively and using transitional phrases to link their paragraphs.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. The sentence ""I agree with this opinion that many young people do not give the time for their communities, but we should change this custom to improve the relationship between the neighbours and me, because if the accidents happens in daily life, others near us help first"" is a bit confusing. The student should rephrase this sentence to clearly summarize their main points and reiterate their thesis statement.

Evaluation:
The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic and provided specific reasons to support their answer. They have also attempted to use examples to illustrate their points, which is a good practice in essay writing. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and cohesion. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the student starts by stating that advertisements make products seem better than they are, but then jumps to discussing the use of famous people in advertisements without connecting the two ideas.

Secondly, the student's language is simple and lacks variety. They rely heavily on basic sentence structures and vocabulary, which makes the essay seem unengaging and unconvincing. For example, the student uses phrases such as ""The reason is that"" and ""Thus the ad makes the product seem better than it actually is"" repeatedly, which can be rephrased to make the writing more sophisticated.

Thirdly, the student's examples are not always relevant or convincing. While they mention the use of famous people and exaggerated claims in advertisements, they do not provide enough evidence to support their claims. For instance, the example of the fairness cream ad is not convincing, as it is not clear how the student knows that the results are not as spectacular as the ad claims.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is weak and lacks a clear summary of the main points. They simply reiterate the main idea without providing a final thought or a call to action.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to express their opinion on the given prompt, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and clarity. Here are some specific points to consider:

1. **Coherence and organization**: The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without connecting them logically. For instance, the transition from the university example to the company example is not smooth. A more coherent structure would help the reader follow the student's argument.

2. **Grammar and vocabulary**: The essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For example, ""In my opinion is better to have a knowledge specialize in one specific subject"" should be ""In my opinion, it is better to have specialized knowledge in one specific subject."" Additionally, the student uses simple vocabulary and lacks variety in sentence structure.

3. **Supporting evidence**: While the student attempts to provide examples, they are not well-developed or relevant. The university example is not clearly explained, and the company example is not connected to the main argument. The student also makes a sweeping statement about professors, scientists, and athletes without providing concrete evidence to support it.

4. **Clarity and concision**: The essay is difficult to understand due to the lack of clear and concise language. The student uses phrases like ""this is true in all the experiences of the life"" and ""we can saw that"" which are unclear and confusing.

5. **Mechanics**: The essay contains several spelling and punctuation errors, which detract from the overall quality of the writing.

Additionally, the student often uses informal language, such as ""In my opinion"" and ""my case,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

In terms of vocabulary, the student could have used more precise and varied words to express their ideas. For example, instead of ""unfamilier,"" they could have used ""unfamiliar."" The student also uses the phrase ""beautiul scene"" instead of ""beautiful scene,"" which is a common error.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. However, their argument is not entirely convincing due to several issues with coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. 

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide examples to support their argument, such as the growth of the car industry in developing countries and the development of new cars by various manufacturers.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""In thenty years from now,"" ""it has been important almost in the past century,"" and ""nottice.""

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""it seems like it's becoming even more important today"" and ""I personaly think"" being used repeatedly. This lack of variety in vocabulary makes the essay seem simplistic and unengaging.

Additionally, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the growth of the car industry to mentioning environmental concerns, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the atatement,"" ""public traffic mass,"" ""entract,"" ""repaid,"" and ""conception."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, the student often uses simplistic sentence structures, which can make the writing seem less sophisticated.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words such as ""fewer,"" ""less,"" and ""reduce."" While these words are accurate in context, they could be replaced with more varied and nuanced vocabulary to enhance the writing.

Thirdly, the student's examples and supporting evidence are somewhat superficial. For instance, the mention of ""Traffic mass Action"" in the student's city is not clearly explained, and the impact of this initiative on the number of cars is not fully explored. Similarly, the student's discussion of the Middle East conflict and its effect on oil prices is brief and lacks depth.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support this claim, which is a positive aspect of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of concrete examples to illustrate the point. The student provides two examples of advertisements for a family car and a washing machine, which effectively demonstrate how marketing departments use various tactics to influence consumers. The student also highlights the potential consequences of these tactics, such as the consumer being misled about the product's actual value.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the marketing department's strategies to advising consumers on how to make informed decisions. A clearer transition between these ideas would enhance the essay's coherence.

Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the advertisements. For instance, the student could have examined the specific techniques used in the advertisements, such as emotional appeals or false comparisons, to make the products seem more appealing.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be more polished. There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""The marketing department of every company tries to make successful advertisement"" and ""The consumers need to make a comparison between some products - which one has the best properties or is the most economiesly.""

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main reasons in support of their stance on the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The introduction is abrupt, and the transition between paragraphs is not smooth. For instance, the first paragraph jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of choosing one's future to sharing a personal anecdote about their own academic experience. A more logical connection between the ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of language is often simplistic and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""it is too early to decide what to study"" and ""we couldn't have such a enough time to think"" demonstrate a lack of idiomatic expression. Additionally, the student frequently uses colloquial expressions like ""in my case"" and ""I could think of my problem enoughly,"" which detract from the overall tone of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's supporting examples are not always relevant or convincing. While the anecdote about taking English classes and double majoring in English and French is a good attempt at providing a personal example, it is not directly related to the topic of broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The example about friends taking leisure sports classes is also somewhat disconnected from the main argument.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize the main points. The final sentence, ""Until graduating from highschool, we couldn't choose what I want to study, and we have rights to choose many subjects and to get interesting information from outside of our major,"" is a repetition of an earlier point and does not provide a satisfying conclusion to the essay.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of verb tenses. For instance, the sentence ""It is really interesting to find out that, in nowadays, more and more advertisements become appeared on televison, newspaper, internet and many distinctive kinds of medias"" should be rewritten as ""It is really interesting to find out that nowadays, more and more advertisements appear on television, newspapers, the internet, and many other kinds of media."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity.

The student also struggles with vocabulary, using phrases such as ""some new effects which the products do not possess"" instead of ""some features that the products do not have."" Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more nuanced language to express their ideas, such as using adjectives to describe the exaggerations in advertisements.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides relevant examples to support their argument. With further practice and attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, the student's writing will improve significantly.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specializing in one specific subject. They provide specific examples and reasons to support their claim, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of relevant examples, such as the neurosurgeon who is unable to handle a flood due to their lack of knowledge about plumbing. This example effectively illustrates the potential limitations of specializing in one subject. Additionally, the student highlights the benefits of having a broad knowledge base, including the ability to link one's needs to relevant information and perform in multiple fields.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets up the argument and provides a thesis statement. The writing could also be more polished, with some sentences being fragmented or lacking coherence. Furthermore, the student could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors, such as ""Depending on the field, knowing about a variety of matters will give the person a broader overview of the topic in which he is trying to specialize"" could be rephrased to ""Having knowledge of various subjects will give a person a broader understanding of the topic they are specializing in.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and misuse of articles. For instance, the sentence ""I am in according with the statement"" should be ""I agree with the statement."" Additionally, the student often uses incorrect verb forms, such as ""I suppose"" instead of ""I think"" or ""I believe.""

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning and coherent examples. The essay jumps between different ideas without a clear connection between them, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For example, the student starts by stating that successful people are motivated to improve and take risks, but then shifts to discussing how people perceive successful individuals as being out of the ordinary. The connection between these ideas is unclear.

Moreover, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic or colloquial expressions, such as ""vocated,"" ""in specking,"" and ""wath."" This lack of vocabulary variety makes the essay seem less polished and less engaging.

However, the student does attempt to provide some examples to support their argument, such as the idea that taking risks is a sign of potential success. However, these examples are not well-developed or convincing, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay provides several reasons and examples to support this claim, including the increasing traffic congestion, the negative impact of traffic on people's health and the environment, the rise in fuel charges, and the promotion of public transportation. The student also mentions alternative solutions such as car-pooling and the development of metro rail systems.

Strengths of the essay include:

* The student provides a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning of the essay.
* The essay is well-organized, with each paragraph focusing on a specific reason for the decrease in car usage.
* The student uses transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs.
* The essay includes a variety of vocabulary, such as ""alarming increase,"" ""aggressive promotion,"" and ""significantly see.""

Weaknesses of the essay include:

* The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the sentence ""The city's infrastructure is not being able to grow proportionately to the traffic resulting increase of jamming of traffic and accidents"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.
* Some sentences are wordy and contain grammatical errors, such as ""With aggresive promotion of usage of public transport system by the government, the number of cars could significantly decrease."" (should be ""With aggressive promotion..."").
* The student could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as statistics on the rise in fuel charges or the number of people using public transportation.
* The essay could benefit from more nuanced and balanced arguments. For example, the student could acknowledge potential counterarguments, such as the convenience of car ownership or the lack of public transportation in some areas.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, providing specific reasons and examples to support their argument. They have also shown an attempt to consider multiple perspectives, acknowledging that both young and old people have their unique ways of enjoying life. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal experiences and anecdotes to illustrate their points. For instance, the example of horse-riding and the reflection on how it relates to youth and age is engaging and helps to convey the student's message. Additionally, the student has attempted to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, which is a good practice in essay writing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I do not think young people enjoy their life more then older people"" (should be ""more than""), ""I think they enjoy it in a more physical way  maybe then older people"" (should be ""maybe than""), and ""I will recall the times  when I sat on a horse and will tell my grand children about how wonderful I looked when I sat on a horse"" (should be ""grandchildren""). These errors can make the essay difficult to follow and detract from the student's message.

Furthermore, the student's argument could be more cohesive and well-supported. While they mention that older people enjoy life in a more contemplative way, they do not provide sufficient evidence to back up this claim. Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""I think about improovement"" (should be ""improvement"") and ""I will recall the times"" (should be ""I recall the times"") suggests a lack of attention to detail and proofreading.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective. While they mention that ""there is a time for everything in life,"" they do not summarize their main points or reiterate their thesis statement. This makes the conclusion feel somewhat abrupt and disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their preference for traveling alone over joining a group led by a tour guide. They provide several reasons to support their opinion, including the desire for a more exciting and authentic cultural experience, the potential for being taken advantage of by the tour guide, and the cost-effectiveness of traveling alone.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to use transitional phrases and linking words to connect their ideas, such as ""First of all,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Forthermore."" However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall coherence of the essay.
2. The student has provided some relevant examples to support their arguments, such as the potential for being taken advantage of by the tour guide and the cost-effectiveness of traveling alone.
3. The student has demonstrated some understanding of the topic, including the idea that traveling is a way to learn about different cultures and the importance of respecting those cultures.

Evaluation:
The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively support the argument. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks coherence, and the writer struggles to connect their ideas logically.

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer jumps directly into providing examples without a clear introduction or a concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. This makes it challenging to follow the writer's argument and understand their perspective.

The writer attempts to use specific examples, such as playing video games, watching movies, and using the internet to find new jobs and habits. However, these examples are not well-developed, and the writer fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that young people can play soccer or basketball in their house using X-box, but they do not explain how this is a more enjoyable experience than playing outside.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""Howevere"" should be spelled as ""However,"" and ""anywhere and any time we want"" should be rephrased for better clarity.

In addition, the writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing video games to watching movies, and then to finding new jobs and habits.

Despite these challenges, the writer demonstrates some understanding of the topic and attempts to provide specific examples to support their argument. However, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, organization, and grammar to effectively convey the writer's ideas.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the writing. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their argument, but these are not always well-developed or effectively linked to the main point.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the writer's use of personal experience to illustrate their point. The anecdote about working at Goldman Sachs and the challenges faced by young people in Japan is a good example of how to use personal experience to support an argument. However, this example is not fully developed, and the writer could have explored the implications of this experience in more depth.

The writer also attempts to provide a second reason for why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, citing the decay of communities. However, this point is not well-supported, and the example of Roppongi, Tokyo, is not a convincing illustration of this point. The writer could have provided more evidence or analysis to support this claim.

The writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is a significant weakness of the essay. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the text, which make it difficult to follow at times. The writer could have benefited from more attention to detail in terms of proofreading and editing.

In terms of organization, the essay could be improved by providing a clearer thesis statement and more effective transitions between paragraphs.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by addressing a specific problem in the Italian scholastic system, which is relatable and engaging. This shows that they can connect the prompt to their own experiences and make it more personal.
2.  They effectively use a quote from an Italian writer to support their argument, demonstrating their ability to incorporate relevant cultural references.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a key requirement of the prompt.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples of how young people are encouraged to participate in community services, such as through school programs like flag day and teaching English at local schools. The student also highlights the importance of community services in university applications, which is a relevant and timely point.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and grammar. For instance, the phrase ""nowadays, it can probably be said that doing community services is not optional but is now becoming compulsory"" could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""All students wants to be accepted by good universities."" The student should also be more precise with their vocabulary, using words like ""undoubtedly"" or ""certainly"" instead of ""I believe that young people nowdays as a matter of fact.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the reasons why young people are more inclined to participate in community services.

The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of examples to support the arguments. The writer has provided relevant examples, such as the use of roads, bridges, and traffic rules, to demonstrate the importance of cars in modern life. Additionally, the writer has mentioned the potential drawbacks of cars, including pollution and the depletion of natural resources.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language is often simplistic and lacks variety.

Furthermore, the writer has used several grammatical errors, such as ""For inctance"" instead of ""For instance"" and ""it's"" instead of ""it is"".

Another area that requires improvement is the organization of ideas. While the writer has provided a clear thesis statement, the supporting paragraphs could be more cohesive and logical. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of cars to the potential drawbacks. A more logical flow of ideas would make the essay more convincing and easier to follow.

Evaluation:
The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, providing two specific examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of tenses, and missing articles. For instance, in the first paragraph, the sentence ""However, I bought a new car three years ago. Because a new car was very high for me, I searched a lot of cars by using internet and talking with salespeople."" is unclear and could be rephrased for better coherence. Additionally, the student often uses simple sentence structures, which can make the writing seem flat and lacking in variety.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, with a reliance on basic words and phrases. While the student attempts to use more complex vocabulary, such as ""misunderstand"" and ""incorporated,"" they often misuse or misuse words, such as ""prodctus"" instead of ""products."" Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more nuanced language to express their ideas, such as using transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs.

Lastly, the student's use of examples is effective in supporting their argument, but could be strengthened by providing more detail and analysis. For instance, in the second example, the student mentions that the computer did not have certain software, but does not explain why this is a significant issue or how it relates to the overall argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of transitional phrases to connect paragraphs.

Strengths:

1.  The student provides relevant examples, such as the invention of the automobile and airplane, to support their argument. These examples are well-chosen and help to illustrate the importance of innovation.
2.  The student also uses a real-life scenario, the strategic management of a company in a competitive market, to demonstrate the need for innovation and risk-taking.
3.  The inclusion of a famous statement, ""Often it is more important to do the right things than to do things right,"" adds depth to the essay and highlights the importance of taking calculated risks.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many sentences are simple and lack complexity.
2.  Some sentences, such as ""Of course there are a few companies staying in the market by focussing on their key competences and by 'doing what they already know how to do well' but to become'successful' as mentioned in the question you have to be innovative,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some examples to support their agreement with the statement. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of precise vocabulary.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by agreeing with the statement but fails to provide a clear explanation or supporting evidence. The essay meanders through various examples, including restaurants and automobile companies, without a clear connection to the original statement.

The student attempts to use examples to support their argument, but these examples are not well-developed or effectively linked to the statement. For instance, the example of restaurants trying new ways to stay in business is not clearly connected to the idea of taking risks. Similarly, the example of automobile companies investing in research and development is not explicitly linked to the statement.

The student also fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a nuanced discussion of the topic. The essay is overly simplistic, with a binary view of risk-taking as always being beneficial. The student also uses vague phrases such as ""it was also having some drawbacks"" without elaborating on what these drawbacks are.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""enjoing"" and ""bussiness,"" detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer expressing a strong opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, including the example of the riots in France, young people's obsession with their appearance, lack of respect for their parents, disrespect towards old people, and neglect of public cleanliness.

Strengths:

1. The writer provides a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, stating their opinion on the topic.
2. The writer uses specific examples, such as the riots in France, to support their argument.
3. The writer attempts to provide multiple reasons for their opinion, including young people's obsession with their appearance, lack of respect for their parents, and neglect of public cleanliness.

Weaknesses:

1. The writer's use of language and grammar is often simplistic and lacks variety, with many basic sentence structures and vocabulary choices.
2. The writer relies heavily on general statements and stereotypes, such as ""young people nowadays"" and ""they don't have any respect for their parents,"" without providing concrete evidence or specific examples.
3. The writer's examples, while specific, are not well-developed or supported with detailed analysis. For example, the writer mentions the riots in France, but does not provide any context or explanation of the underlying causes or consequences.
4. The writer's tone is often negative and critical, which may come across as biased or unfair.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Vary sentence structure and vocabulary to create more complex and engaging writing.
2. Provide more specific and detailed examples to support arguments, and analyze the underlying causes and consequences of the issues mentioned.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and offering some reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, ""I doesn't agree"" should be ""I don't agree,"" ""In my opionen"" should be ""In my opinion,"" and ""putting drugs into their body to have fun"" could be rephrased to ""putting drugs into their bodies to have fun."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's arguments are not well-developed and lack specific examples to support their claims. While they mention that older people enjoy different activities, such as traveling and reading, they fail to provide concrete evidence to back up this assertion. Additionally, the student's example about their parents is somewhat unclear and does not effectively illustrate their point.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and cohesion. Many sentences are short and lack connecting words, making the text feel disjointed. For example, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the conclusion feels tacked on.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and attempts to provide a nuanced perspective. They also show some awareness of the importance of enjoying life at all stages of life.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. The essay is well-structured, with two main reasons provided to support the argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes to illustrate the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. The student's experiences with their brother and their own struggles to explain things to others are relatable and help to make the argument more convincing. Additionally, the student has attempted to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, which is a good practice.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""leraning"" instead of ""learning,"" ""substantisal"" instead of ""substantial,"" and ""sicnce"" instead of ""since."" These errors can make the writing difficult to understand and detract from the overall message.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences to convey their ideas. For example, the phrase ""I think to learn ideas is the most important"" could be rephrased to ""I believe that learning ideas is the most important"" to make the writing more sophisticated.

Additionally, the student's conclusion could be stronger. While they reiterate their agreement with the statement, they could also summarize the main points made in the essay and provide a final thought or call to action.

Evaluation:

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the given prompt, and their essay attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their stance. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear and does not directly address the prompt. They argue that understanding ideas and concepts is important for learning facts, which is the opposite of the original statement. A clearer thesis statement would be more effective in guiding the reader through the essay.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""thorey"" instead of ""theory,"" ""transported"" instead of ""transmitted,"" ""croop"" instead of ""cope,"" and ""bewildering"" instead of ""baffling."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions, such as ""funny stories,"" ""hoax,"" and ""deception."" While these expressions may be familiar to native speakers, they may not be suitable for formal writing.

Fourthly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps between different ideas and examples without a clear logical flow. For instance, the discussion of ""funny stories"" seems unrelated to the main topic, and the example of students reading Time News could be more effectively integrated into the essay.

Lastly, the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs is lacking. The essay feels disjointed, and the reader is left to piece together the different ideas.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of examples to support their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and logical structure. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a smooth transition between paragraphs. For instance, the first paragraph starts by stating that understanding ideas and concepts is more important, but the example provided is somewhat disconnected from the main argument. The student mentions learning about Plato, but fails to explain how understanding his philosophy relates to the importance of ideas over facts.

Another issue is the use of simplistic and vague language. Phrases such as ""you can make use of ideas and you will remember ideas for a long time"" do not provide concrete evidence to support the student's claim. The student also uses incorrect grammar and spelling, such as ""perspection"" instead of ""perspective"" and ""in conlcusion"" instead of ""in conclusion."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student attempts to provide examples, but they are not well-developed or relevant to the topic. The example about Chinese characters is confusing and does not clearly illustrate the point that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion that summarizes their main points and reiterates their argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy. The student's writing is riddled with spelling mistakes, incorrect verb tenses, and sentence structure issues. 

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide reasons and examples to support their opinion. They mention several advantages of traveling in a group, such as sharing experiences with others, learning new information, and being motivated to explore new places. However, these points are not well-developed and lack specific examples to support their claims.

The student also struggles with sentence-level writing, often using simplistic sentence structures and failing to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. For instance, the sentence ""travelling in a group make more advantages becuse if the information about a place is not known to the guide i will try to know the information with my colleagues who are in the group"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. They fail to consider potential drawbacks of traveling in a group, such as the loss of personal freedom or the potential for groupthink. Additionally, their writing lacks specific examples and anecdotes to support their claims, making their arguments feel somewhat generic.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. However, there are some areas that require improvement in terms of language accuracy, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples to support their arguments, such as the comparison between dogmatic understanding and critical analysis. The student also shows a good understanding of the importance of facts in understanding ideas, as seen in the explanation of the historical context of communism and nazism.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's language is sometimes inaccurate, with errors in verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and word choice. For example, ""In my opinion in order to have a better understanding of ideas, concepts must be supported by facts"" could be rephrased as ""In my opinion, understanding ideas requires concepts to be supported by facts."" Additionally, the student uses some complex vocabulary, such as ""empiric analisys,"" which is not commonly used in everyday language.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and some sentences could be rephrased for better coherence. For instance, the sentence ""At last, I would say that you don't really understand anything if you can't prove it and explain it with facts"" feels disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has made a clear attempt to address the prompt and provide reasons to support their opinion. They have also demonstrated an understanding of the importance of learning concepts and ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""Learning mechanism works in different way person to person"" is not directly related to the main topic and seems to be a non-sequitur. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""if you dont know the ideas belong them and concepts."" This suggests that the student needs to work on sentence structure and grammar.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""it can be work in small period of time"" should be ""it can work in a short period of time."" The student also uses the phrase ""as a result"" to conclude their essay, but it feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the previous paragraphs.

In terms of content, the student provides some good points, such as the idea that learning concepts and ideas can help remember facts and make learning new topics easier. However, their examples are not always well-supported and could be more concrete. For instance, they mention that ""every lecture has facts and the ideas' and the relationship between facts and ideas are the same,"" but they do not provide a clear explanation of what this means.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis. While they argue that learning ideas is better than memorizing facts, they do not consider potential counterarguments or provide a more detailed explanation of why this is the case.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often simplistic and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack connecting words, making the text feel disjointed. For example, in the first paragraph, the sentence ""Although my family payed a great deal of money, we enjoyed the travel since the travel was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and flow.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with many basic words and phrases repeated throughout the essay. For instance, the phrase ""people should notice that"" is used twice, and the word ""travel"" is used excessively. The student could benefit from using more advanced vocabulary to convey their ideas more effectively.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the example of the kidnapped traveler is a good start, it could be developed further to make it more convincing. Additionally, the student could provide more specific examples of the benefits of traveling in a group, such as the social aspect or the opportunity to meet new people.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention that companies spend a lot of money on advertising, which can make products seem better than they really are. They also provide an example of a product that claims to cure headaches but does not actually do so. These examples demonstrate the student's understanding of the topic and their ability to think critically.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors and typos. For example, ""Recently, you may realiz the there are more and more advertisements"" should be ""Recently, you may realize that there are more and more advertisements."" Additionally, ""a products of beed quality cost  much on advertisments"" should be ""products of good quality cost a lot on advertisements."" These errors can make the essay difficult to read and understand.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""In my opinion, i agree with that statement"" could be rephrased as ""In my opinion, I agree with this statement."" The student also uses colloquial expressions such as ""deep thougt"" and ""not resposible,"" which can make the essay sound informal.

In terms of content, the student's argument is clear, but it could be more nuanced.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use thanking to the technologycal progress"" (should be ""thanks to technological progress""), ""naural resources"" (should be ""natural resources""), ""rumour has it that scientist already invented it"" (should be ""scientists have already invented it""), ""towars"" (should be ""towards""), and ""solT"" (should be ""sold""). These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions, such as ""get along with nature"" and ""help nature."" While the student attempts to provide examples to support their argument, they often lack specificity and depth. For instance, the statement ""modern scientist are looking for a kind of car who does not pollute the air"" could be more effectively supported with concrete examples of existing or proposed alternative fuel sources.

Additionally, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the development of alternative fuel sources to the impact of public transportation on car usage. A clearer transition between ideas would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples to support their argument. They also show an awareness of the importance of environmental issues and the role of technology in addressing them.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The student has divided the essay into two main points, one for children and teenagers and the other for adults, but the transitions between these points are not smooth.

The student has provided some valid points, such as the importance of exploring various subjects for children to understand the world and discover their interests. However, the language and grammar used are often inaccurate, with several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""kwoledge,"" ""diversitive,"" ""particular subjucts,"" ""aldutes""). The student also struggles with sentence structure and word choice, which affects the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples to support the student's claims. While the student mentions that new knowledge is being explored every day, they do not provide any concrete examples of how this affects adults in their careers. Additionally, the student's conclusion that the choice between broad knowledge and specialization depends on personal need is a valid point, but it feels somewhat abrupt and could be developed further.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide,"" and has provided some relevant reasons to support their opinion. However, there are areas where the student's writing could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Strengths:

1.  The student has attempted to address both aspects of the prompt, providing reasons for why traveling with a tour guide is beneficial, including gaining knowledge and saving money.
2.  The student has used some relevant examples from their personal experiences to support their arguments, such as traveling to Hong Kong and Cambodia.
3.  The student has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""To begin,"" ""Moreover,"" and ""To wrap up.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence, with some sentences feeling disconnected from the rest of the essay.
2.  The student's use of vocabulary is limited, with some phrases and sentences feeling repetitive or cliche (""I strongly believe,"" ""To begin,"" ""To wrap up"").
3.  The student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of their ideas, particularly in the second paragraph where they discuss the benefits of traveling with a tour guide.
4.  The student's use of grammar and punctuation is not always accurate, with some sentences feeling awkwardly phrased or containing errors.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Encourage the student to revise their essay to make it more cohesive and connected, using transitional phrases and sentences to link their ideas together.
2.  Suggest that the student expand their vocabulary and use more nuanced language to express their ideas.
3.  Encourage the student to provide more detailed explanations of their ideas, particularly in the second paragraph.
4.  Remind the student to proofread their work carefully to ensure accuracy in grammar and punctuation.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and misuse of articles. Additionally, the student's argument is not well-supported, and their examples are not effectively linked to the statement.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's misunderstanding of the prompt. The student seems to be arguing that learning facts is more important than understanding concepts, but this is the opposite of the original statement. The student should have taken the time to carefully read and understand the prompt before writing the essay.

The student's use of examples is also problematic. While the student attempts to use real-world examples, such as the John Nash equilibrium and the reclassification of Pluto, these examples are not effectively integrated into the essay. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing clear transitions or connections between the ideas.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. The student simply states their opinion without providing any supporting evidence or reasoning. For example, the student claims that it is easier to memorize a fact than a concept, but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim.

However, the student does attempt to address the prompt and provide some examples to support their argument. With significant revision and editing, the student may be able to produce a more effective essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and supporting it with some reasons. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""In my opinoin,"" ""innerside,"" ""experditure,"" ""literally relys,"" and ""maturally."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message. 

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions, such as ""enjoying the life is to be peaceful in the innerside."" More nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary would help to convey the student's ideas more effectively. 

In terms of content, the student provides some valid points, such as the idea that older people have financial independence and can pursue their goals and interests. However, the student could have explored these ideas more thoroughly and provided more specific examples to support their claims. 

Additionally, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the financial independence of older people to mentioning their stable goals and interests. A more logical and coherent structure would help to improve the flow of the essay. 

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more concise and focused conclusion would help to leave a stronger impression on the reader.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given statement, providing three examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""although facts provide a clear and better opinion for a particular subject but personally i think that to understand the basic concepts and the main idea behind the subject is much better as compared to simply knowing the facts"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand. The student should rephrase this sentence to improve its clarity.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of incorrect word choice. For example, ""cram the things"" should be ""memorize the things"" or ""learn the things by heart."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""in order to get a better promotion they have to learn the concepts well so that they perform well,"" which is a bit wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Thirdly, the student's examples, although relevant, lack depth and analysis. For instance, the example about the football player could be more effective if the student had explained how understanding the concept of the game helped them improve their skills or how it affected their performance.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

Strengths:

- The student has attempted to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as traffic problems, car accidents, and air pollution.
- The student has mentioned some potential solutions to the problems caused by the car industry, such as developing railroads and encouraging the use of bicycles.
- The student has demonstrated a clear and consistent tone throughout the essay.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement and supporting it with examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the clarity and coherence of the text. For instance, ""sereval"" should be spelled as ""several,"" ""pepole"" should be spelled as ""people,"" and ""compitition"" should be spelled as ""competition."" These errors hinder the reader's understanding of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions. For example, ""I think we should improve our life right now"" could be rephrased as ""I believe that we should strive for self-improvement."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic, with a lack of variety in sentence length and complexity.

In terms of content, the student provides two examples to support their argument: the development of the computer and the creation of the mp3 player. While these examples are relevant, they are not thoroughly explained, and the student fails to provide a clear connection between the examples and the statement. For instance, the student states that successful people should take risks to improve their life, but they do not explicitly explain how this relates to the examples provided.

Despite these limitations, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and provides a coherent argument. They also attempt to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""On the other hand"" and ""In addition.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and offering some reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify pollution as a significant issue and its connection to the use of cars. They have also provided some relevant examples, such as the growth of the ozone layer and the negative impact of ultraviolet lights on health. Additionally, the student has suggested alternative modes of transportation, like trains and bicycles, which is a good approach to reducing pollution.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with several grammatical errors and incorrect sentence structures. For instance, the sentence ""For this reasons the ozono whole grows up day for day and with its the ultraviolets lights that are nocive fot our health"" is difficult to understand due to the incorrect use of articles and verb tenses. Furthermore, the student has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims, relying heavily on general statements and vague assertions.

Another area for improvement is the organization and development of ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the ozone layer to suggesting alternative modes of transportation, without a clear logical connection between the ideas. The student also fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a clear conclusion to summarize their main points.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks precision and accuracy in terms of vocabulary and grammar. For example, the use of ""affermation"" instead of ""affirmation"" and ""noumerose"" instead of ""numerous"" are noticeable errors.

2. The student has used some relevant examples, such as the observation of students by teachers in developed countries, to support their argument.
3. The student has attempted to address the counterargument, suggesting that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be beneficial, but ultimately concludes that specializing in one subject is more effective.

Weaknesses:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively disagreeing with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The essay is well-structured, with three distinct reasons presented to support the argument. 

The student's first point highlights the subjective nature of enjoying life, effectively challenging the assumption that youth is directly linked to happiness. The example of young people experiencing depression is a strong counterargument, as it shows that age is not a determining factor in one's ability to enjoy life. However, the sentence structure and grammar in this paragraph could be improved for better clarity.

The second point raises valid concerns about making generalizations about a subjective concept like enjoying life. The student questions how to compare the enjoyment of different groups and what constitutes ""enjoying life,"" which are thought-provoking questions that demonstrate critical thinking. However, some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as ""For me is not  accurate nor completely correct"" and ""Less problable it is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger people.""

The third point further develops the idea that the concept of enjoying life is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. The student's argument that older and younger people may enjoy life in their own ways is a compelling one, but the sentence structure and grammar could be improved for better clarity.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents valid arguments to support their stance. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure, grammar, and clarity.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity. The essay starts with a clear disagreement with the statement, but the subsequent paragraphs do not effectively link to the initial statement. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of traveling without a tour guide to stating their preference for this method. A more logical flow of ideas and transitional phrases would enhance the essay's overall coherence.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the essay's overall quality. For instance, the sentence ""If we shouldn't travel with tour guide, we can sight seeing any where"" contains grammatical errors and an incorrect use of the word ""sightseeing."" Additionally, the student uses colloquial expressions such as ""get along with my freinds"" and ""ect."" which detract from the essay's formal tone.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the anecdote about traveling to Japan with friends is a good starting point, it lacks depth and analysis. The student could have explored the benefits of traveling without a tour guide in more detail, such as the opportunity to engage with local culture, try new foods, or develop independence.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, effectively agreeing with the idea that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has provided specific examples from various types of advertisements, including TV commercials and magazine ads, to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the tactics used by advertisers to make products seem more appealing. For instance, the example of the Coke commercial is a good illustration of how advertisers use unrelated scenarios to associate their product with happiness. Similarly, the discussion of diet product advertisements is a good example of how advertisers exaggerate the benefits of their products.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the language used is sometimes simplistic and lacks variety. For example, the phrase ""exagerating them"" could be replaced with a more precise term, such as ""exaggerating their benefits."" Additionally, some sentences are worded in a way that makes them difficult to understand, such as ""they try to sell the idea that a refresh drink can make you happy no matter what."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""they try to sell the idea that a refreshing drink can make you happy regardless of the circumstances.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the advertisements they discussed. For example, they could have explored the reasons behind the use of these tactics or discussed the potential consequences of these tactics on consumers.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, their essay is marred by several grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of their writing. 

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide personal anecdotes to support their argument. The examples from their experiences in Bombay and with their relatives demonstrate their capacity to think critically and reflect on their experiences. However, the student could have benefited from more nuanced and detailed descriptions of these experiences to make their points more convincing.

The student's reasoning is also somewhat simplistic, relying on general statements such as ""a guide is a professional person"" without providing concrete evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, the student's use of phrases such as ""I and my friends"" and ""me with my relatives"" is incorrect, as it should be ""my friends and I"" and ""my relatives and I"" respectively.

In terms of organization, the essay could be improved by a clearer introduction and conclusion that ties together the student's main points. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the drawbacks of having a guide to stating their preference for traveling without a guide.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided some relevant examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has attempted to address the question by providing a clear thesis statement and supporting it with specific examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the tactics used by advertisers to make products seem better than they are. The examples provided, such as the use of unrealistic settings and models in advertisements, are relevant and well-explained. The student also correctly identifies the issue of advertisers exaggerating the capabilities of products, citing the example of a toothpaste making someone's teeth as white as pearls.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the role of advertisements in our lives to explaining the tactics used by advertisers. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for clarity.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the examples provided. For instance, the writer could have explored the psychological impact of these tactics on consumers or discussed the potential consequences of such advertising practices.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The writer could have also provided a more thoughtful final thought or recommendation for addressing the issue.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, providing specific reasons and examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has also attempted to address potential counterarguments, which is a commendable aspect of their writing.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and verb tense inconsistencies. For instance, in the first paragraph, the student writes ""For many decades professors, politicians, employers, intellectualls and students in Germany have been discussing the question what an academic education should be like."" The correct sentence should read ""For many decades, professors, politicians, employers, intellectuals, and students in Germany have been discussing the question of what an academic education should be like."" Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words such as ""better"" and ""specific.""

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be more nuanced and supported by concrete evidence. For example, when discussing the importance of specializing in one subject, the student relies on a general statement about companies needing specialists without providing specific examples or data to back up this claim. The student also fails to address potential drawbacks of specializing, such as the risk of becoming too narrow in one's expertise.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and a more sophisticated writing style. The essay is written mainly in simple sentences, which can make it seem flat and unengaging. The student could also benefit from using more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a well-structured essay that presents a nuanced view on the statement. They have provided examples from both the scientific and economic fields to support their argument, which is commendable. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""If the'success' means economical or scientifical success,"" which should be ""If success means economic or scientific success."" Additionally, ""deveropment"" should be ""development,"" and ""homogenius"" should be ""homogeneous."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""convinient"" (should be ""convenient"") and ""impotant"" (should be ""important"") being used incorrectly. This suggests that the student may not have a strong command of English vocabulary.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat unclear. They seem to be saying that while trying new things and taking risks can lead to success, it is also important to maintain traditional matters, theories, and cultures. However, this point is not fully developed, and the student does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.

The student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking. For example, the sentence ""The chalanges is more impotant now!"" seems to come out of nowhere and is not clearly linked to the previous or subsequent ideas.

The essay is well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides two concrete examples from their personal experiences in New York and China, which serve as strong evidence to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use specific details and anecdotes to illustrate their points. For instance, the description of getting lost in the streets of New York and the subsequent benefits of having a tour guide is a vivid and relatable example. Similarly, the student's experience of changing their opinion about China after hearing the tour guide's perspective is a compelling example of the value of guided tours.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary, particularly in the use of transitional phrases and sentence structures. For example, the essay relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, the student could provide more nuanced and balanced arguments, acknowledging potential counterarguments or limitations of guided tours.

Furthermore, there are some minor errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling, such as ""an appropiate"" (should be ""appropriate""), ""we were going to find poor people living under a communist regime"" (this sentence could be rephrased for better clarity), and ""If we had not had the help of a tour guide, my family and me would never have been able to visit New York as a true New Yorker"" (should be ""my family and I"").

The essay is well-structured, with two main reasons provided to support the argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Japanse"" instead of ""Japanese,"" ""Fujisaki Nanako"" instead of ""Fujisaki Naoko"" (assuming the correct spelling), ""thoght"" instead of ""thought,"" and ""Okaie"" instead of ""Okai"" (assuming the correct spelling). These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is limited, making the essay feel somewhat disjointed at times. For example, the transition between the two main reasons is abrupt, and the use of phrases like ""By contrast"" and ""Therefore"" could be used more effectively to connect the ideas.

Thirdly, the student's examples, while relevant, could be more effectively analyzed and supported. For instance, the discussion of the Nintendo DS could be more detailed, and the student could provide more specific examples of how the advertisement made the product seem better than it really was. Similarly, the example from the brand strategy class could be more thoroughly explained, and the student could provide more insight into the class discussion and the students' reactions.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and clarity. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons for why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, citing technology as a major factor. However, the essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and sentences that are often disconnected from one another.

One of the main issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors and typos, which hinder the reader's understanding of the writer's intended message. For instance, the phrase ""to starting to teach"" should be ""to start teaching,"" and ""binifial"" should be ""beneficial."" Additionally, the writer often uses vague phrases such as ""alot of things"" and ""unneccessary things,"" which could be rephrased for greater clarity.

The writer also attempts to provide examples to support their argument, but these are often unclear or incomplete. For example, the statement ""they need help from the community just to guid such people to the safe coast"" is confusing and lacks context. Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""nowadays people are more oriented than the former people"" is grammatically incorrect and does not contribute to the overall argument.

Despite these issues, the writer does attempt to provide some insightful ideas, such as the importance of teaching young people how to be effective community members and the need for guidance to help them find their place in the community.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to present a balanced view of the topic. They acknowledge the advantages and disadvantages of being young and old, which shows a good understanding of the complexity of the issue. The use of specific examples, such as the old teacher who started studying philosophy, is effective in supporting their argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, the phrase ""it depends on the age in which way one enjoys it"" could be rephrased to something like ""it ultimately depends on how one chooses to enjoy life at any age."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be broken up for better clarity.

In terms of grammar, there are a few errors that need to be addressed. For example, the sentence ""The greatest problem of being old are certainly the many illnesses"" should be ""One of the greatest problems of being old is certainly the many illnesses."" The use of the present perfect tense is also inconsistent, with some sentences using the present perfect and others using the simple past.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""sciologists"" (should be ""scientists""), ""not occur"" (should be ""do not occur""), ""derease"" (should be ""decrease""), and ""Hower"" (should be ""However""). These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""it is hard to invent new one"" and ""we usually watch flying cars in the movies"" being overly simplistic. Additionally, the student's use of idiomatic expressions, such as ""get rid of car on the road,"" is not entirely accurate.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of hybrid cars to the difficulty of inventing new cars like flying cars. A clearer transition between ideas would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear, as they seem to contradict themselves by stating that it will take almost 100 years for there to be fewer cars than today, but then suggesting that more attention and inventory are needed to get rid of cars on the road.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given topic, providing some relevant reasons and examples to support their stance. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and misuse of articles. For instance, ""Young people is a process to old"" should be ""Young people are a process to becoming old."" Additionally, ""They are trying to improve themselves' ability"" should be ""They are trying to improve their abilities."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions and clichés. For example, ""We should save money for our old lives"" could be rephrased as ""It is essential to save money for our future."" The student also uses a few idiomatic expressions, such as ""get a job and earn money,"" but could benefit from using more complex and nuanced language.

In terms of content, the student provides some relevant examples to support their argument, including the two men's stories and the ant and insect analogy. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student could benefit from providing more detailed and concrete evidence to strengthen their argument.

The student also shows some understanding of the topic, acknowledging that young people can enjoy their lives but emphasizing the importance of saving money and improving oneself. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement and a more logical structure to guide the reader through the student's argument.

Evaluation: 
The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer effectively uses specific reasons and examples to support their claim, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to define the term ""enjoying life"" and provide a nuanced explanation of what it means to truly enjoy life. This helps to establish a solid foundation for their argument and sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer also provides a good range of examples, including book reading, gardening, and community events, to illustrate how older people can enjoy life in different ways.

The writer's use of a counterexample, such as the father who builds a house for his family, is effective in highlighting the idea that enjoyment is not limited to young people's activities. This example also shows the writer's ability to think critically and challenge the assumption that young people are the only ones who can enjoy life.

However, there are some areas for improvement. At times, the writer's sentences can be a bit long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""Therefore they would seldom indulge in activities which are popularly seen as being part of enjoying life"" could be broken up for better clarity. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good command of English grammar and vocabulary, and their writing is clear and easy to understand. However, there are some areas where they could improve their writing style and organization.

The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and attempts to address the topic with some relevant points. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer jumps directly into discussing the statement without providing a clear stance or argument. A more effective approach would be to begin with a clear thesis statement that outlines the writer's position on the statement.

Secondly, the essay contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""diong"" instead of ""doing,"" ""wil"" instead of ""will,"" ""opnion"" instead of ""opinion,"" and ""ins ome cases"" instead of ""in some cases."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and professionalism of the essay.

Thirdly, the writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, when discussing the characteristics of successful people, the writer mentions a ""chart listing the basic characteristics of a successful person"" but fails to provide any concrete details about what these characteristics are or how they relate to the statement. Providing specific examples or anecdotes would strengthen the writer's arguments and make the essay more engaging.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion feels abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement, summarize the main points, and provide a final thought or call to action.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer provides two main reasons to support their argument: having a deeper understanding of their field and taking on more responsibility. 

The writer's use of examples, such as their brother's experience with making a new product, is a good attempt to illustrate their points. However, the examples could be more detailed and effectively connected to the main argument. For instance, the writer could have explained how their brother's experience with the new product led to his increased understanding of the field and sense of responsibility.

The writer's language and grammar are generally understandable, but there are several errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and vocabulary. For example, ""Recently,some psycologyst proclaimed"" should be ""Recently, some psychologists proclaimed,"" and ""neccesiary"" should be ""necessary."" The writer also uses colloquial expressions like ""put off his book,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

The writer's ideas are somewhat disjointed, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The final sentence, ""Lastry finding new ways about their field makes some,"" seems incomplete and unclear.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher score. The writer has provided some relevant points to support their opinion, but there are also noticeable errors in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples and references to support their argument. For instance, they mention the increasing number of old people participating in sports and communities, which suggests that they are indeed enjoying their lives. Additionally, the writer acknowledges the advancements in medical research and its positive impact on the quality of life for older people.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple words and phrases. For example, the phrase ""the majority of old people is frustated and isolated from society"" could be rephrased to ""many older people feel isolated and disconnected from society."" Furthermore, the writer's sentence structure is often simplistic, which makes the text difficult to follow at times.

Another area for improvement is the writer's ability to organize their ideas coherently. The essay jumps between different points without a clear logical connection between them. For instance, the writer starts by discussing the supposed isolation of older people, then moves on to the increasing number of old people participating in sports, and finally concludes that young people may not necessarily enjoy their lives more. A clearer structure and more logical flow of ideas would enhance the overall coherence of the essay.

Lastly, the writer's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, which makes the text feel disjointed at times. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the supposed isolation of older people to the increasing number of old people participating in sports without a clear transition.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and well-structured essay that presents both sides of the argument. The writer has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas and has provided specific examples to support their claims. However, there are some areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the importance of learning facts, particularly in subjects like history and medicine. They also correctly argue that understanding concepts and ideas is essential for retaining information and applying it in real-life situations. The writer's use of phrases such as ""it is of course crucial"" and ""in this way"" demonstrates a good command of English vocabulary.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often repetitive, with phrases such as ""as I already said"" and ""as I mentioned before"" used to connect ideas. This can make the essay seem less cohesive and less engaging. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as the use of ""definetely"" instead of ""definitely"" and ""possibilty"" instead of ""possibility"".

Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary to express their ideas. For example, instead of using the phrase ""it is helpful to find a way in between them,"" the writer could use a more precise phrase such as ""a balanced approach"" or ""a middle ground.""

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""definitelty"" instead of ""definitely,"" ""loanmower"" instead of ""lawnmower,"" and ""examlpe"" instead of ""example."" These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the overall quality of the writing.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences and phrases. For example, the sentence ""One could easily say that a car is not that important"" is a bit simplistic and could be rephrased for more impact. The student also uses some idiomatic expressions, such as ""peak of the iceberg,"" but could benefit from using more complex and varied language.

In terms of content, the student provides some good points, such as the potential consequences of a world without fossil fuels and the importance of reducing our reliance on them. However, the student could have explored these ideas more deeply and provided more specific examples to support their arguments.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the reliability of advertisements. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective organization. The writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is also limited, which affects the overall understanding of their argument.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples to support the writer's claims. The writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""the advertisements that are in the television and in the stores are not reliable,"" without providing concrete evidence to back up these assertions. Additionally, the writer's use of phrases like ""in an indirect way"" and ""the truth of the product is exaggerated"" is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of the writer's argument.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks variety. The use of short, simple sentences, such as ""The companies that produce those products do this to convince us that the product is worth every penny you pay for it,"" makes the essay feel like a list of disconnected ideas rather than a cohesive argument.

However, the writer does attempt to address the prompt by discussing the ways in which companies use advertisements to deceive consumers. The writer notes that companies may exaggerate the characteristics and abilities of their products, which is a valid point. However, this idea is not fully developed, and the writer does not provide enough evidence to support this claim.

Strengths:

1.  The student has attempted to provide a range of examples, including Warren Buffet's investment strategies, the discovery of electricity and antibiotics, and the exploration of the Americas. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to illustrate the idea that taking risks can lead to success.
2.  The student has used quotes from Warren Buffet to add depth and authenticity to their argument.
3.  The essay attempts to address the idea that hard work and dedication are also necessary for success, which is a nuanced aspect of the topic.

2.  The student's transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the connections between ideas could be more explicitly stated.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, ""Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities."" They have also provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided concrete examples to support their argument, such as the fact that many young people have busy lives due to university, work, and social activities. They have also acknowledged the importance of career, enjoyment, and relaxation as values in their society. Additionally, the student has shown self-awareness by admitting that they too struggle to find time to help their community.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. The student's stance on the statement is not explicitly stated in the introduction, and it takes several paragraphs to understand their position. Secondly, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The ideas seem to jump abruptly from one topic to another, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. Thirdly, the student's use of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure is not always accurate. For example, the sentence ""i do not think that it's a right behaviour but i think it depends on our society also"" is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased for clarity.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples and supporting evidence is not always effective. While they mention that many young people are busy, they do not provide concrete statistics or data to support this claim. Additionally, the student's personal anecdote about not having enough free time to help their community is not a convincing example, as it is based on their own personal circumstances rather than a broader societal trend.

Secondly, the student's arguments are not well-supported and lack coherence. The first reason provided, that group travel is more economical, is not clearly explained, and the student's personal experience is not directly related to this point. The second reason, that traveling with a tour guide allows for more freedom, is also not clearly articulated, and the student's statement that they do not need a leader to enjoy their life is not well-supported. The third reason, that group travel is safer, is also not clearly explained, and the student's statement that they should be brave to face challenges in life is not relevant to the topic.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth.

The essay provides some relevant examples to support the argument, such as the importance of understanding the concept of a government that takes care of its people and the significance of human rights. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The student often uses incomplete sentences, incorrect grammar, and spelling mistakes, which make it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the sentence ""i will like to describe some points that support this statement to understand better why I am agree"" should be rewritten as ""I would like to describe some points that support this statement to better understand why I agree."" Additionally, the student uses informal language, such as ""i"" instead of ""I"" and ""procces"" instead of ""process.""

Another issue is the lack of depth and development in the examples provided. While the student mentions that understanding the concept of human rights is more important than learning the date when they were signed, they do not provide a clear explanation of what this understanding entails. For example, what specific aspects of human rights should students understand, and how can they apply this understanding in real-life situations?

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is limited. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of understanding concepts to talking about practicing and applying them. A more cohesive structure would help to strengthen the argument and make it easier to follow.

The student's essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, and they provide specific reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing Michael Jordan and Tom Cruise to disagreeing with the statement. A more logical connection between the introduction and the body paragraphs would improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the clarity and effectiveness of their writing.

Additionally, the student uses informal language, such as ""I feel that"" and ""I believe that,"" which is not suitable for an academic essay.

Thirdly, the student's arguments could be more developed and supported with concrete evidence. While they mention that specializing in one subject is a more definite way to succeed, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this claim. Furthermore, their argument that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is only helpful in childhood is not well-supported and could be challenged.

The student starts by mentioning the importance of traveling and the benefits of traveling in a group, which is a good starting point. However, they then contradict themselves by stating that a group does not need a guide to help them. This inconsistency makes it difficult to understand their stance on the issue.

The student provides a personal anecdote about their trip to Spain, which is a good attempt to provide evidence to support their argument. However, the story is not well-structured, and the student jumps between ideas without connecting them logically. The use of grammar and vocabulary is also not accurate in some places, such as ""taked a taxi"" instead of ""took a taxi"" and ""resterants"" instead of ""restaurants"".

The student also mentions the use of the internet and GPS as reasons why people do not need a guide. While this is a valid point, it is not well-developed and could be explored further.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student jumps between ideas and does not provide a clear thesis statement. The language is also not sophisticated, with many grammatical errors and simple vocabulary.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given topic, and their writing demonstrates a basic understanding of the subject matter. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the connection between the ideas is not explicitly stated. The student jumps from discussing the importance of understanding concepts to providing examples without a clear link between the two ideas.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the overall flow and readability of the essay. For example, the phrase ""these days the technology has developed, new things are been invented this is only because of the main reason that is logical thinking about some thing"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Similarly, the sentence ""And coming to the secondary of the topic which deals with the learning of facts"" is a non-standard expression.

Thirdly, the student's examples, although well-intentioned, are not entirely accurate. For instance, the student mentions Graham Bell inventing the telephone, but it is not clear how this relates to understanding concepts versus learning facts. Additionally, the example of Sastry discovering a new fuel for automobiles is not supported by any credible sources and seems to be an unsubstantiated claim.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay. The final sentence, ""This idea would be great benificial for the society,"" seems to be a non-sequitur and does not provide a clear summary of the main argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their disagreement with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of specific examples to support their claims.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to articulate their thoughts clearly. The writing is often fragmented, with sentences that are incomplete or lack logical connections. For instance, the student states, ""i think that every thing should be advertiesed as the way they are not as the way they look like well this is totally wrong."" This sentence is unclear and does not effectively convey the student's point.

Furthermore, the student fails to provide concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention that advertisements are ""not nice to see a friend fall into this situation,"" they do not provide a specific example of a product that was misrepresented in an advertisement. This lack of evidence makes their argument weak and unconvincing.

The student also makes some valid points, such as the importance of honesty in advertising and the potential consequences of misleading consumers. However, these points are not developed effectively, and the student's writing style makes it difficult to follow their train of thought.

In terms of vocabulary, the student uses some basic vocabulary, but often uses incorrect words or phrases, such as ""stupid things"" and ""new's papper."" This suggests that the student needs to work on expanding their vocabulary and using more precise language.

Overall, while the student has attempted to address the prompt, their essay is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide specific examples to support their claims.

The student has made a good effort to address the prompt and provide reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the introduction could be more effective if it provided a clear thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The current introduction seems to be a general statement without a clear direction. The student should have started by stating their opinion on the statement and then proceeded to provide evidence to support it.

Secondly, the student has provided some good points to support their argument, such as the idea that young people are more active and have more free time. However, the language and grammar used in some sentences are not accurate, which can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For example, ""They are more activ"" should be ""They are more active."" Additionally, ""qrguments"" should be ""arguments,"" and ""invicible"" should be ""invincible.""

Furthermore, the student has not fully explored the opposing side of the argument. While they mention some reasons why older people might enjoy life less, they do not provide a balanced analysis of the statement. A more effective essay would have provided a more comprehensive discussion of both sides of the argument.

Finally, the conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student should have rephrased the thesis statement and provided a more concise summary of the main arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic and supporting it with personal experiences and examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. The student starts with a rhetorical question, but it is not directly linked to the main argument. A more effective introduction would provide a concise overview of the topic and clearly state the student's position.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, making the essay seem disjointed at times. For instance, the sentence ""That shouldn't mean, that young people do not enjoy their life"" feels disconnected from the preceding sentence. The student could have used transitional words or phrases to link ideas more smoothly.

Thirdly, the student's writing contains some grammatical errors and colloquial expressions, such as ""it has something to do with the life experiance"" and ""flz somewhere very nice."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

Evaluation:

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its argument. The writer seems to be discussing the differences between young and old people, but the connection to the original statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"" is not explicitly made. The essay meanders through various points, including nightlife, responsibilities, and money, without providing a clear stance on the original statement.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence in the writing. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow the argument. For example, the writer states that young people do not have to worry about telling their parents where they are or what they are doing, but this point is not directly related to the original statement.

Another issue is the use of simplistic and inaccurate language. The writer uses phrases such as ""differents"" instead of ""differences,"" ""inportant"" instead of ""important,"" and ""bay"" instead of ""buy."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The writer also fails to provide specific examples to support their points. For instance, when discussing nightlife, the writer simply states that young people can enjoy a night club without restrictions, but does not provide any evidence or examples to back up this claim.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a clear thesis statement or summary.

However, the writer does attempt to address the original statement in the conclusion, stating that life for old people is better and that young people can enjoy life but not as much as they want. This is a clear stance, but it is not supported by the previous arguments in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some relevant points to support this claim, including the significant investment in advertisements by enterprises and the idea that people often buy the concept of a product rather than its actual quality. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The student often uses simple sentences and lacks transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs. For instance, the first paragraph jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of selling a product to stating that advertisements are well-known for their effects. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Another area for improvement is grammar and vocabulary. The student has several grammatical errors, such as ""Every economist today knows that It is so important to know to sell the product, than the cuality of it"" (should be ""than the quality of it"") and ""stadistical studies"" (should be ""statistical studies""). Additionally, the student uses colloquial expressions like ""It is well known"" and ""we don't buy the product, we buy the concept of the product,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

The student also fails to provide concrete evidence to support some of their claims. For example, the anecdote about the child and the pirate ship toy is an interesting example, but it is not directly related to the topic of advertisements making products seem better than they are. Furthermore, the student's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has attempted to address the given prompt, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, organization, and language accuracy. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating that cars are an important issue in their country, but this does not directly relate to the prompt. They then provide some reasons for reducing the number of cars, such as pollution, traffic accidents, and the rise of gas prices. However, the connection between these reasons and the prompt is not explicitly stated.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. For example, ""The car, actually, are one of most important issue in my country"" should be ""Cars are one of the most important issues in my country."" Additionally, ""We know exactly that cars have got a big responsibility"" should be ""We know that cars have a big responsibility."" These errors in sentence structure and grammar make the essay difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases such as ""enormous problem"" and ""big responsibility."" While these phrases are understandable, they do not demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the topic.

However, the student does attempt to provide some solutions to the problem, such as improving public transport. This shows that they are thinking critically about the issue and are willing to propose potential solutions.

In terms of content, the student provides some relevant information about the negative effects of cars, such as pollution and traffic accidents. However, they do not provide any concrete evidence or statistics to support their claims.

Overall, while the student has made an effort to address the prompt, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, organization, and language accuracy.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured with two main reasons provided to support the opinion. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of language accuracy, grammar, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a personal experience to illustrate the first reason, which makes the argument more relatable and engaging. The student effectively uses the example of buying a cell phone to show how advertisements can be misleading. Additionally, the student attempts to provide a second reason, which is that producers prioritize selling products over their quality, and this attitude is changing in developed countries.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the language used is often simple and lacks variety, which makes the essay seem repetitive and unengaging. For instance, the phrase ""I agree with the statement"" is repeated at the beginning and end of the essay, which could be avoided. Secondly, there are several grammatical errors, such as ""I was a t a loss"" (should be ""I was at a loss""), ""it is important to discern the advertisements more carefully"" (should be ""it is essential to be more discerning when reading advertisements""), and ""picyure"" (should be ""picture""). Lastly, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the ideas could be more fully developed.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, providing both reasons to support their agreement and counterarguments to acknowledge the benefits of advertisements. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and transitions between paragraphs. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the argument, such as the example of hair cleaning products on TV. This helps to make the argument more convincing and engaging. The student also attempts to provide a balanced view by acknowledging the benefits of advertisements, such as introducing new products and creating job opportunities.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""most advertisement do some exagerations"" (should be ""most advertisements make some exaggerations"") and ""we must to face thousands of brands"" (should be ""we must face thousands of brands""). Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""It is really attractive"" (this sentence could be rephrased for better clarity).

Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to enhance the overall coherence and fluency of the essay.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

The student also uses vague phrases such as ""on one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" without providing clear explanations or connections between the two ideas.

In terms of language, the student has made some grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. For example, the student writes ""the numbers of cars increase always"" instead of ""the number of cars increases.""

Another area for improvement is the student's ability to address counterarguments. While the student mentions that some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them of making their own decisions, they do not provide a thorough response to this argument. A more effective response would be to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of traveling with a tour guide and provide evidence to counter these arguments.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not provide a clear summary of the main points. A more effective conclusion would be to reiterate the thesis statement and summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their own experience as a university student to support their argument. This shows that they can think critically and relate the topic to their own life. The student also attempts to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, which is a good effort.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's grammar and vocabulary are not yet at a proficient level. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""I think that for a student are very imporatant"" should be ""I think that for students it is very important."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, which makes the essay feel a bit flat.

Furthermore, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of learning facts to talking about gaining an advancement in a company. A clearer transition between these ideas would make the essay flow better.

Finally, the student's use of examples and supporting evidence could be more effective. While the examples are relevant, they are not fully developed and could be used to support the argument more convincingly.

The essay attempts to address the given prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The writer's ideas are somewhat clear, but the expression and organization of these ideas are not well-developed. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the use of vague and imprecise language. For instance, the phrase ""more activity"" is used without a clear definition, making it difficult to understand what the writer means. Additionally, the sentence ""It's becuse older people don't have enough power of dancing for a long time"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks coherence. 

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete examples to support their claims. The statement ""there is festival in life"" is too vague and does not provide any specific information about how young people enjoy life during festivals. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a clear explanation of why young people enjoy life more than older people.

The conclusion is also somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The writer simply states that ""young people can enjoy in life"" without providing any supporting evidence or reiterating the main reasons.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main points to support their stance on advertisements. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its overall effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The introduction is vague and does not clearly state their stance on the prompt. The use of phrases such as ""many factories and companey"" and ""so how we can know the ture"" indicates a lack of attention to grammar and spelling. Furthermore, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the idea of asking people who have tried the product to the suggestion of buying the product without hesitation.

Secondly, the student's use of examples is weak. The anecdote about the cousin buying a sport machine without researching it is not a convincing example of how to evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements. The conclusion is also unclear, as the student seems to be contradicting themselves by stating that advertisements can be useful in many times, but then suggesting that one should be cautious when buying products based on advertisements.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. The essay relies heavily on simplistic statements and does not provide any nuanced discussion of the topic. The student fails to consider the potential biases and manipulative tactics used by advertisers to influence consumers.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and clarity. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat disconnected from the prompt. The essay begins with a personal story about a friend who struggled to find a job, but the connection to the prompt is not explicitly made until the second paragraph. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's stance on the prompt and provided a thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""befor"" instead of ""before,"" ""frind"" instead of ""friend,"" and ""exellent"" instead of ""excellent."" These errors detract from the overall coherence of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Thirdly, the student's examples are somewhat simplistic and lack depth. For instance, the example of having an engineering major with some computer courses is not a particularly compelling argument for the benefits of broad knowledge. A more nuanced discussion of the benefits of interdisciplinary knowledge would have been more effective.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat repetitive and does not provide a clear summary of the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have restated the thesis statement and provided a final thought on the importance of broad knowledge.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's effort to provide examples to support their argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement. However, their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of English language. 

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating their agreement but fails to provide a concise and focused thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. 

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, resulting in sentences that are often fragmented and difficult to understand. For instance, the sentence ""Facts are results of ideas and concepts. Good ideal and concept make good facts. However, bad ideas and concepts meke bad facts."" is a good example of this issue. The student seems to be trying to convey a logical connection between ideas, concepts, and facts, but the sentence structure and vocabulary hinder the clarity of the message.

Additionally, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak. The essay lacks a clear structure, and the student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing sufficient explanation or supporting evidence. 

Despite these challenges, the student attempts to provide a logical connection between ideas and concepts, which is a positive aspect of the essay. However, this connection is not well-developed or effectively supported.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the given topic, but their writing requires improvement in several areas. One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the anecdote about their friend who is passionate about cars. However, the student's writing is marred by several issues that hinder the clarity and coherence of their ideas.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks proper sentence structure and grammar. For instance, the sentence ""The reason why I prefer this one is that if someone is specialized in one specific subject, I think this person is quite boring person"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. The student should rephrase this sentence to convey their intended meaning more effectively.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, which affects the overall quality of their writing. Phrases such as ""I think this one"" and ""I dont have to talk that much"" are not idiomatic expressions and make the text sound unnatural. The student should strive to use more varied and precise vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Thirdly, the student's argument is not well-organized, and their ideas are not clearly linked together. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the drawbacks of specializing in one subject to mentioning the benefits of having broad knowledge. A more logical and cohesive structure would improve the overall flow of the essay.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize their main points. The student states that both personalities are valuable, but this conclusion feels tacked on and does not provide a satisfying conclusion to the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the best way to travel, which is in a group led by a tour guide. They have used some reasons and examples to support their answer, but there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity. The essay starts with a vague statement, ""There are many ways one can travel,"" which does not directly address the prompt. The student then shifts to their preference for traveling in a group led by a tour guide, but the transition between ideas is not smooth. The use of transitional phrases and sentences would help to improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""i do prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide"" should be ""I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""by this way"" which is not idiomatic in English.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and lacks depth. The examples provided, such as the trip to Singapore, are not well-developed and do not provide sufficient evidence to support the student's claims. The student could have provided more detailed descriptions of the benefits of hiring a tour guide, such as the knowledge of local customs, history, and culture.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is not well-supported. The student states that hiring a tour guide is ""more worth than the amount we pay them,"" but this is not a convincing argument.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the importance of trying new things and taking risks for a successful life. However, the essay demonstrates several areas that require improvement in terms of language accuracy, coherence, and organization.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The essay begins with a vague statement, ""Do you want to live successful life?"" which does not directly address the prompt. The student later clarifies their opinion, stating that successful people try new things and take risks, but this could be more effectively introduced as a thesis statement at the beginning of the essay.

The student provides two reasons to support their opinion, but they are not well-developed and lack specific examples. The first reason, ""nomal people do nomal things,"" is unclear and does not effectively connect to the idea of trying new things. The second reason, ""life is a venture,"" is a well-known phrase, but the student fails to provide a clear explanation of how this relates to taking risks and trying new things.

Furthermore, the student struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors throughout the essay. For example, ""nomal"" instead of ""normal,"" ""envaluable"" instead of ""valuable,"" and ""cach"" instead of ""catch"" are just a few examples. These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks variety in sentence structure and vocabulary. Many sentences are simple and lack depth, making the essay feel flat and unengaging.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They have identified two types of advertisements (post-modern and modern) and explained how post-modern advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of a product by focusing on its image or impression rather than its utility. The student has also provided a concrete example from their country, which shows how insurance companies use visual advertisements to make their products seem more appealing.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The student's answer is somewhat buried in the body paragraphs, and it would be helpful to have a clear statement at the beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the examples they provided. While the example from their country is a good start, it would be helpful to see more depth and analysis of the ways in which advertisements can be misleading.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, ""The years give us intelligence in most of the times"" should be ""Years give us intelligence most of the time."" Similarly, ""yong people"" should be ""young people,"" and ""laves"" should be ""lives."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of word repetition, such as ""enjoyed"" and ""life.""

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The writer relies heavily on simple sentence structures, which can make the text seem somewhat flat. Additionally, there are instances of grammatical errors, such as ""I definitely agree with the statement at hand"" and ""we are most likely going to forget in the future."" These errors can be distracting and detract from the overall coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from more nuanced analysis and depth in their examples. While the historical context is a good starting point, the writer could have explored more complex relationships between ideas and concepts, rather than simply stating that facts are important but ultimately forgettable.

Lastly, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay. The writer could have summarized their main points more effectively and provided a more satisfying conclusion.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement and supporting it with examples. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved to demonstrate a higher level of proficiency in English and critical thinking.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""if you just one way to a solution, sometimes you can not be able to make a solution"" is unclear and should be rephrased to convey the intended meaning. Additionally, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times.

Furthermore, the student's examples, although well-intentioned, are not entirely relevant to the topic. The example of being unable to write on a PC because one is only able to write with their hands is not directly related to the statement about broad knowledge versus specialization. A more relevant example would be the benefits of having a broad knowledge in a professional or academic setting.

The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""you will get in troble in many situations in daylie business live"" should be ""you will get into trouble in many situations in daily business life."" The student's use of vocabulary is also limited, with words like ""troble,"" ""dicuss,"" and ""varety"" being misspelled.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some relevant points to support their opinion. They also attempt to provide a conclusion, summarizing the benefits of having a broad knowledge.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. The essay is well-structured, with three main points supported by examples. The student has attempted to use relevant vocabulary and sentence structures, although there are some areas for improvement.

Strengths:

- The student has provided a clear thesis statement and supported it with three main points, which is a good structure for an essay.
- The use of examples, such as the bank bond and joining a club, helps to illustrate the points made and engage the reader.
- The student has attempted to use transitional phrases, such as ""First of all,"" ""Secondly,"" and ""Finally,"" to connect the ideas between paragraphs.

Weaknesses:

- The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the statement ""life is full of risks"" is a common phrase that could be more effectively explored.
- There are several grammatical errors, such as ""The issue at hand is whether successful people should take risks or do what they already know how to do well"" (should be ""The issue at hand is whether successful people should take risks or stick to what they already know how to do well""), ""I believe that one should try new things and explore all the oppurtunities around him/her"" (should be ""I believe that one should try new things and explore all the opportunities around him/her""), and ""a person who goes for a 100$ is not aware of his/her abilities"" (should be ""a person who goes for a $100 is not aware of his/her abilities"").
- The student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words such as ""oppurtunities"" and ""beauties"" being used incorrectly.
- The final sentence, ""If Napoleon Bonapart was alive, I believe he would say 'risk, risk, risk, success, success, success' instead of'money, money, money',"" feels like an afterthought and could be removed.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer starts by stating that cars are convenient but then shifts to discussing the future and the potential replacement of cars with personal flying devices and robots. While these ideas are relevant to the topic, they are not effectively linked to the initial statement.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, ""convenient  life"" should be ""convenient life,"" ""potrayed"" should be ""portrayed,"" and ""saterlites"" should be ""satellites."" These errors make the text difficult to read and understand.

In terms of content, the writer provides some interesting ideas, such as the development of personal flying devices and robots, but fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to support their claims. The writer also makes a statement about people visiting other planets, which is not supported by any credible sources.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely on simple sentences and phrases. For example, ""we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge matter of wasting"" could be rephrased to ""we may abandon our cars, making them a waste of resources.""

Finally, the writer's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize their argument. The final sentence, ""We cannot deter th chan,"" is incomplete and does not provide a clear message.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples from their personal experience and observations to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the labour market changes, they could have provided more specific examples of how the division of work has affected job opportunities. Additionally, the student could have explored counterarguments to their position, demonstrating a more critical thinking approach.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical and linguistic errors throughout the essay, such as ""In trying to find something adequate to my generalistic preparation"" (better rephrased as ""I realized that my generalistic preparation was not sufficient for finding a job"") and ""who offers a job is generally looking for qualified candidates, for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic or, in better words, who is specialized in a specific subject"" (better rephrased as ""Companies are generally looking for candidates with specialized knowledge in a particular area""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a significant strength.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""The lack of social commitment among youngs has been a common perception since always"" (should be ""since always"" is not a grammatically correct phrase, and ""youngs"" should be ""young people""), ""it is very common to listen on media or simply when old people are chatting, that yougsters don-t participate or that they are not interested on the community problems"" (should be ""that young people do not participate or are not interested in community problems""), and ""the base in with the opinion"" (should be ""the basis for the opinion""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is sometimes imprecise. For example, ""magnificy"" should be ""magnify"", and ""less visible as struggles in demonstrations"" should be ""less visible than struggles in demonstrations"".

Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their argument. While the student mentions their own experience as a volunteer and friends who are active in their community, these examples could be fleshed out with more specific details and anecdotes.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" They have provided three main reasons to support their argument: 

Firstly, the student argues that advertisements often present unrealistic or exaggerated information, which cannot be verified by simply watching an advertisement. They use the example of a car advertisement to illustrate this point, highlighting the importance of experiencing a product firsthand before making a purchase.

Secondly, the student criticizes the practice of using popular celebrities to endorse products, citing an example of a bike advertisement that was endorsed by a sports star but received negative reviews from friends who purchased the bike. This example effectively demonstrates how advertisements can be misleading and lead to poor purchasing decisions.

Thirdly, the student questions the authenticity of advertisements by suggesting that the people who create and endorse them often do not use the products themselves. They use the example of an actor endorsing a personal computer brand but using a different brand in a film production unit.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more varied sentence structures. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, which can make them difficult to understand. Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their arguments.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their argument. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The sentences are often fragmented, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the sentence ""the life is changed from the past I mean every things became faster and faster in this life"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Similarly, the transition from the first point to the second point is abrupt, and the connection between the ideas is not explicitly stated.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the overall quality of the essay. For example, the student uses ""wirh"" instead of ""with"" in the sentence ""the young people are busy wirh their study and their own life."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simple, and they could benefit from using more complex sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples to support their argument is limited. While they mention that young people in the past did not worry about their studies, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, the student's prediction that young people will be busier in the future due to technology development is not well-supported and could be developed further.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize their main points.

The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, arguing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer presents several reasons to support this claim, including the fact that young people have many things to do, lack a clear life goal, and are influenced by modernization and the media. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the impact of modernization on young people's behavior and the influence of the media on their values. The writer also attempts to provide a solution to the problem, suggesting that young people need education and training, parents should be models, and the media should promote social responsibility.

However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and sentences often disconnected from each other. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the reasons why young people do not help their communities to suggesting solutions. Additionally, some sentences are grammatically incorrect or contain spelling mistakes, which can make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims and developed their ideas more thoroughly. For example, they mention that young people have many things to do, but do not explain what these things are or how they prevent young people from helping their communities. Similarly, the writer states that the media delivers ""error massages"" to young people, but does not provide any specific examples or analysis of how this affects their behavior.

In terms of language use, the writer struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are many instances of subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect use of tenses, and awkward phrasing. While the writer attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, they are often used incorrectly or in an unnatural way.

Overall, the essay demonstrates some understanding of the topic and provides a clear stance, but is marred by poor organization, grammar, and language use. With more attention to these areas, the writer could produce a more effective and convincing essay.

The essay attempts to address the prompt by providing three main points to support the argument that young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction is also unclear and lacks coherence, with the writer jumping abruptly from discussing technological advancements to the topic of young people enjoying life more than older people.

The three main points provided are somewhat relevant to the topic, but they are not well-developed and lack specific examples to support the claims. For instance, the first point about young people not thinking about their future and older people being preoccupied with their retirement and health is a good starting point, but it is not elaborated upon. The writer could have provided more concrete examples to illustrate this point, such as how young people prioritize short-term gratification over long-term planning.

The second point about young people being easily distracted by new things is also not well-supported. The writer could have provided more specific examples of how young people spend their time and money on new things, such as social media, video games, or trendy clothing. The statement ""you only use older people's money to enjoy your life"" is also unclear and could be misinterpreted.

The third point about young people prioritizing their own lives over their families is also not well-supported. The writer could have provided more specific examples of how young people's priorities differ from those of older people, such as how young people are more likely to prioritize their own desires over family obligations.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the research study at the student's university and the Italian government's plan to impose a tax on big cars. These examples help to support the student's argument and make the essay more convincing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous, It is possible to provide some good reasons to support it"" (missing article and incorrect use of ""It is possible to provide""). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""As everybody knows"" and ""it is not difficult to understand why"" being overused.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of relevant examples, such as the statistics on vehicular pollution (42% contribution to environmental degradation) and the example of Venice as a pollution-free state. The student also attempts to address potential counterarguments, such as the possibility of an eco-friendly car breakthrough.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""i would substaniate,"" ""its tough to imagine,"" and ""its indeed tough to imagine."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

The student also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""people do not use vehicles in venice,"" without providing sufficient context or explanation.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

However, there are some areas that need attention. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""On the one hand, I agree that learning facts is significant but on the other hand, only understanding ideas and concept allows students to really move something"" could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. Furthermore, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, there are a few errors that need to be addressed. For example, ""To illustrate my thesis, I would like to explain how my father works"" could be rephrased as ""To illustrate my point, I would like to share an example from my father's work."" Additionally, ""they employed poisons like atropin which is responsible for rejecting specific neurons to pass a cell membran"" should be ""they employed poisons like atropine, which is responsible for blocking specific neurons from passing through the cell membrane.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. The essay provides two main reasons to support this claim: (1) taking risks can lead to discovering new fields and opportunities, and (2) if a risk does not work out, one can always go back to the previous situation.

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student provides specific examples from the field of engineering to illustrate their points, which shows a good understanding of the topic.
- The student attempts to apply the concept of taking risks to other areas of life, such as marriage, demonstrating an attempt to think critically about the idea.
- The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I will explain why I agree with the statement using an specifical career like engineering"" (should be ""I will explain why I agree with the statement using a specific career like engineering""), ""Risks can take you to fields of your carrer that you did not even know exists"" (should be ""Risks can take you to fields of your career that you did not even know exist""), and ""Another advantage ot taking risks is that if you fail you can always go back to what you where doing before"" (should be ""Another advantage of taking risks is that if you fail, you can always go back to what you were doing before"").
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain unclear phrasing, such as ""Let's think of a new product we want to develop"" (this sentence seems out of place and could be rephrased).

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a response that includes three examples of different subjects (scientific, art, and medical) to support their opinion. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The student starts by introducing the topic but fails to provide a clear thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The essay meanders through different examples without a clear connection between them.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's use of language. There are numerous grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing throughout the text. For instance, the student uses ""By the name of ALLAH"" as a greeting, which is not relevant to the prompt. Additionally, the sentence ""In the first we will describe the main lines of our subject"" should be ""In the first, we will describe the main lines of our subject"" (subject-verb agreement). The student also uses incorrect verb tenses, such as ""I will begin from the presentation of subject to the students"" (should be ""I will begin by presenting the subject to the students"").

The student's arguments are also unclear and lack supporting evidence. In the scientific subject example, the student states that it's not important for students to understand ideas because they can learn facts from other sources. However, this argument is not well-supported, and the student fails to provide concrete examples. In the art subject example, the student argues that art subjects are open to interpretation, but this does not necessarily mean that understanding ideas is not important.

The student's conclusion is also unclear and lacks a clear summary of their main points. The student states that their opinion may be mistaken, but they still maintain that understanding facts is more important than understanding ideas.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. They provide some valid points to support their argument, such as the increasing demand for cars due to convenience and the development of eco-friendly cars. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""peopel"" instead of ""people,"" ""arised"" instead of ""arises,"" and ""inceasing"" instead of ""increasing."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic, which can make the writing seem less engaging and less convincing.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is limited and not always relevant. For instance, the study by the Korean Public Transportation Institute is not clearly referenced, and the example of Seoul citizens favoring their own cars for convenience is not directly related to the topic of the essay. The mention of eco-friendly cars is a good point, but it is not fully developed, and the example of the electronic vehicle in Japan is not clearly connected to the argument.

The student also struggles with vocabulary, using words like ""favorate"" instead of ""favorite"" and ""inovated"" instead of ""invented."" These errors suggest a lack of familiarity with English vocabulary and grammar.

In terms of organization, the essay could be improved by providing a clearer thesis statement and a more logical structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the convenience of cars to the environmental issue, and the conclusion is not a strong summary of the main points.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has attempted to use specific examples to support their argument, such as the example of a toy for kids and the target market of aged persons. However, these examples could be more effectively integrated into the essay to make it flow better.

The student has also demonstrated an understanding of the role of marketing and advertising in shaping consumer behavior. They have correctly identified that enterprises use various tactics to influence consumers, including appealing to their desires and needs.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""it seems that everybody from the twentieth century must be aware"" which is a bit unclear. Additionally, the student could benefit from using more varied vocabulary to express their ideas.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure. The student jumps between ideas and does not provide a clear thesis statement that ties the entire essay together. The conclusion is also somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Finally, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. For example, they could explore the ways in which advertising can be misleading and how consumers can critically evaluate advertisements.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which makes it challenging to follow the student's line of reasoning. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation mistakes. For instance, the student uses ""I'm agree"" instead of ""I agree,"" ""I have twentythree years old"" instead of ""I am 23 years old,"" and ""becouse"" instead of ""because."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

In terms of content, the student provides some personal anecdotes, such as playing sports with friends, which are relevant to the topic. However, the student fails to provide a clear and well-supported argument to justify their claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The student mentions that older people experience difficulties and illnesses, but this is not a convincing reason to conclude that young people enjoy life more.

The student also fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a nuanced discussion of the topic. For example, they mention that older people may experience close contact with relatives, but they do not explore the potential benefits of this relationship or how it might contribute to overall happiness.

In conclusion, while the student has attempted to address the prompt, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, coherence, and content. The student needs to work on providing a clear and well-supported argument, addressing potential counterarguments, and refining their writing skills.

The essay is well-organized, and the writer has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. The use of specific examples and vocabulary, such as ""profound knowledge,"" ""specialized tasks,"" and ""complex entity,"" shows a good command of English language.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the writer often uses incorrect verb tenses, such as switching between the present and past simple tenses within the same sentence. For example, ""In the today's professional and academic world it is important to have profound knowlade of a specif subject"" should be ""In today's professional and academic world, it is important to have profound knowledge of a specific subject."" Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as ""Insofar students should achieve a profound expertise in a special area"" should be ""However, students should achieve a profound expertise in a specific area.""

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but their writing is marred by several issues that hinder the clarity and coherence of their argument. Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear, as they seem to be arguing that people can enjoy life at any stage of their lives, rather than directly addressing the prompt. This confusion is further exacerbated by the inclusion of unrelated quotes and references to historical figures, which, while interesting, do not directly support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of vivid imagery and metaphors, such as ""men's finest hour"" and ""lying on his battlefield, exhausted, but victorious."" These phrases effectively convey the idea that life is a journey of challenges and triumphs. However, the student's writing is often unclear and lacks cohesion, with sentences that are poorly constructed and contain grammatical errors.

The student also struggles to provide concrete evidence to support their argument. While they mention Homer's quote, they do not explain its relevance to the topic or provide any further analysis. Similarly, the reference to De'Medici's poems is not developed or explained. The student's use of phrases such as ""we can say"" and ""in my opinion"" also detract from the authority and confidence of their argument.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the idea that people can enjoy life at any stage to arguing that old people have a heavy burden of responsibility. The transition between these ideas is unclear, and the student fails to provide a clear conclusion that ties together their argument.

One of the main issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, such as ""I gree,"" ""adverxistment,"" ""mach,"" ""reaseons,"" ""poeple,"" and ""imagnation.""

The student has made a good effort to address the prompt by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the introduction could be stronger. The student starts by referencing a popular question, but fails to clearly link it to the topic at hand. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

In the first part of the essay, the student provides some good examples to support the advantages of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. For instance, the example of a student who takes physics and biology having various career choices is a good illustration. However, the student could have provided more concrete examples and elaborated on the benefits of having a broad knowledge in more detail.

In the second part of the essay, the student discusses the disadvantages of specializing in one subject. The example of a student specializing in nursing and having to change orientation later is a good illustration of the potential risks of specializing too early. However, the student could have provided more nuanced arguments and explored the potential consequences of specializing in one subject in more depth.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of broad knowledge to the disadvantages of specializing. A clearer transition between the two parts would have improved the flow of the essay.

Furthermore, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, ""Recalling tghe popular say"" should be ""Recalling the popular saying"", and ""exanple"" should be ""example"".

They have used specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is commendable. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, the transition from the automobile industry to the financial area is not smooth, and the connection between the two is not explicitly stated.

For example, ""bussiness"" should be spelled as ""business,"" ""dramatical"" should be spelled as ""dramatic,"" ""reputaion"" should be spelled as ""reputation,"" and ""speculating"" should be spelled as ""speculative."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentences. While this is understandable for a second language learner, it would be beneficial for them to incorporate more complex sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance their writing.

Similarly, the example of technology improving rapidly is a good starting point, but it could be expanded upon to provide more concrete evidence.

Lastly, the student's conclusion, while attempting to summarize the main points, feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its argumentation. The writer jumps between ideas and fails to provide a logical connection between the introduction and the body paragraphs.

The essay starts by mentioning the impact of wars on the world and the resilience of older people, which seems unrelated to the main topic. The writer then shifts to the idea that older people know the value of life and enjoy it more because they have experienced hardships. This is a good point, but it is not developed thoroughly.

The writer also criticizes young people for taking their lives for granted and enjoying them without purpose. The example of a young man committing suicide due to a lack of purpose is a strong point, but it is not well-integrated into the rest of the essay. The conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points.

The writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally poor, with several errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and spelling. For example, ""The world we live in had a hard time because of several wars"" should be ""The world we live in has had a hard time because of several wars."" Additionally, ""bacons"" should be ""bacon"" (a singular noun), and ""yeh"" is an informal expression that should be avoided in formal writing.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. However, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. 

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The student starts by stating that having broad knowledge is crucial, but fails to provide a clear argument or claim that ties the entire essay together. The essay meanders through various points, including the importance of competing in a crowded world, the need for intelligence and power, and the changing nature of competition. While these points are relevant to the topic, they are not effectively linked to the main argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""it is an undeniable fact that having broad knowladge of many academic subjects has a crucial importance,"" ""their academic education procces,"" and ""the most important weapon in this competition is having broad knowledge in today's world."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

In terms of content, the student provides some relevant examples, such as the need to compete in a crowded world and the importance of intelligence and power. However, these examples are not fully developed or supported with evidence. The student also relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the world and age has significantly changed."" This lack of specificity and depth makes it difficult to assess the student's argument.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and provides some relevant points. With further development and refinement, their writing could be more effective in conveying their argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some reasons and examples to support their answer. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with many sentences being fragmented and difficult to follow. For instance, the first sentence ""There are young people and older people who were enjoying their life"" is unclear and does not directly address the prompt. The student also struggles to provide a clear thesis statement, instead presenting a series of disconnected ideas.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, with several spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay. For example, ""they can go to school and  learn subjects and skills that is fun and importance to do"" should be ""they can go to school and learn subjects and skills that are fun and important to do."" Additionally, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Despite these issues, the student does attempt to provide some specific reasons and examples to support their answer. For instance, they mention that young people can go to school and learn new skills, while older people may struggle to find jobs. They also provide a personal anecdote about their grandmother, which adds some depth to their argument.

However, the student's conclusion is somewhat confusing, as they seem to be agreeing with their grandmother's opinion that they would prefer to be young again, but then contradict this by stating that they decided to travel when they were young. This lack of clarity and consistency undermines the student's overall argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The student has provided three main reasons to support their argument, but these reasons are not well-connected and lack specific examples to support their claims.

One of the main issues with the essay is the presence of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the text. For instance, ""nowsaday"" should be ""today,"" ""exapand"" should be ""expand,"" and ""peolpe"" should be ""people."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

The student has also struggled to provide specific examples to support their claims. While they mention their grandfather and mother as examples, these anecdotes are not well-developed and lack detail. For instance, the student could have provided more information about the computer their grandfather bought, such as the brand and model, to make the example more convincing.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not well-supported. While they claim that advertisements make products seem better to make more money, attract more people, and expand their business, they do not provide sufficient evidence to back up these claims. The student could have provided more research or data to support their argument, such as statistics on the effectiveness of advertising or examples of companies that have successfully used advertising to expand their business.

Finally, the student's conclusion is not well-written and lacks a clear summary of their main points. The student could have provided a more concise summary of their argument and reiterate their main points in a more effective manner.

However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of precise examples to support their arguments.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the repetition of the phrase ""broad knowledge"" and ""academic subjects,"" which becomes tiresome to read.

Additionally, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge in a company setting to making general statements about the importance of being ""conceptual and practical in real-time situations.""

The student attempts to provide an example from a company setting, but it is not well-developed and lacks specific details. The use of phrases like ""an efficent and effective people,"" ""all round change in its performance,"" and ""perfect soloution"" is unclear and does not contribute to the argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by presenting their opinion on the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."" However, their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument. The student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect spellings, and awkward sentence structures, which hinder the reader's understanding of their ideas.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's failure to provide a clear and concise thesis statement. The opening sentence, ""Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects prevents one's true learning, and therefore is not a reliable way to study, compared to specializing in one specific subject,"" is a statement rather than a thesis. It does not provide a clear direction for the rest of the essay.

The student attempts to support their argument with personal anecdotes from their experience in middle school, but these examples are not effectively linked to the main argument. The student also attempts to address potential counterarguments, but their responses are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence.

The student's writing also suffers from a lack of organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the difficulties of studying multiple subjects to arguing that having broad knowledge is not useful. The student's ideas are not well-connected, and the transitions between paragraphs are unclear.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic or colloquial expressions. For example, the student uses the phrase ""not a reliable way to study"" instead of a more formal phrase like ""not an effective way to learn."" The student also uses incorrect spellings, such as ""Endineering"" and ""annalyzing,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student attempts to engage with the topic and provide some original ideas. They argue that having broad knowledge can prevent one from truly learning something, and that specializing in one subject allows for a deeper understanding and enjoyment of the subject.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support the answer, which is a good start. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clarity and coherence in the writing. The student often uses simple sentences and lacks transitional phrases to connect their ideas. For example, the first sentence ""It is a known fact that in todays society the word community is not that usual anymore"" is a good starting point, but the following sentences lack connection to this idea. The student jumps abruptly to the idea that young people are not involved in communities, without explaining how this relates to the initial statement.

Another issue is the use of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""shourly"" should be spelled as ""shortly,"" ""deffinatly"" should be spelled as ""definitely,"" and ""peolple"" should be spelled as ""people."" These errors make the essay difficult to read and understand.

The student also struggles to provide concrete examples to support their claims. While they mention that young people are busy with other activities, they do not provide specific examples of how this affects their community involvement. Similarly, the idea that young people do not want to work for free is mentioned, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

Despite these issues, the student shows some understanding of the importance of community involvement and the potential consequences of not participating. They mention that communities can be a social network that helps in hard times and that young people need to learn how to be part of a society. These ideas are relevant to the topic and demonstrate some critical thinking.

To improve, the student should focus on clarifying their ideas, using transitional phrases to connect their thoughts, and providing concrete examples to support their claims. They should also proofread their work to eliminate grammatical and spelling errors.

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat unclear and does not directly address the prompt. They mention that they cannot agree or disagree with the statement because it is too general, which is a valid point, but it would have been better to elaborate on this idea in more detail. The transition to the main body of the essay is also abrupt, and the student jumps directly into discussing the importance of personal attitude without providing a clear connection to the prompt.

In the main body of the essay, the student provides some interesting examples to illustrate their point, such as the contrast between a young, unhappy person and an old, happy person. However, the writing could be more cohesive and logical. The student jumps between ideas and does not always provide clear connections between paragraphs. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""Anybody would agree to this in general however very few try to benifit from this fact."" (benefit from this fact).

The student's personal anecdote at the end of the essay is a good way to conclude their argument, but it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay. It would have been better to integrate this example more smoothly into the main body of the essay.

In terms of grammar and vocabulary, the student has made some mistakes, such as using ""to general"" instead of ""too general"" and ""peradise"" instead of ""paradise."" However, the student has also used some more complex vocabulary, such as ""outweight"" (outweigh) and ""relativ wealth"" (relative wealth).

One of the main issues is the lack of coherence and organization in the essay. The writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For example, the writer starts by mentioning inexperience, then moves to finances, and finally concludes with a comparison to a race. A more logical flow of ideas would have made the essay easier to follow.

Another issue is the use of vocabulary and grammar. The writer uses several words and phrases that are not commonly used in English, such as ""inmaturity"" and ""thougthful."" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, such as the use of ""big deal big deal"" instead of ""a big deal"" and ""what can I say"" instead of ""to say.""

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and verb tense inconsistencies. For instance, in the first paragraph, the student writes ""I believe that the governments of many countries in the world are recently beginning to restrict the use of cars because of their several serious problems."" The use of ""recently"" is unnecessary and creates a sense of awkwardness. Additionally, the phrase ""their several serious problems"" should be rephrased to ""several serious problems"" as the subject-verb agreement is incorrect.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, leading to repetitive and simplistic expressions. For example, the phrase ""do not have problems which cars have"" is a direct translation from the student's native language and lacks idiomatic expression. The student could have used more sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the examples provided, such as the linear motor car, are relevant, they are not fully developed.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples and reasons to support their argument. For instance, they mention that having a broad knowledge allows individuals to use information to create a good social life and to be more flexible in changing their work during their life. Additionally, the student shares a personal experience of feeling incomplete when discussing topics outside their area of specialization, which adds a touch of authenticity to their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""There are two way,"" ""speecializing,"" ""knoledge,"" and ""liong."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words like ""I think"" and ""I believe."" This makes the writing seem simplistic and lacks depth.

Another area for improvement is the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs. While the essay is generally well-structured, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, which disrupt the flow of ideas. For example, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of broad knowledge to sharing a personal experience.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. For instance, they mention that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives students the possibility to apply for a wider range of job ads, which is a valid point. Additionally, they argue that even specialists need to adapt to the needs of the company they are working for, which shows an understanding of the real-world implications of specializing in a particular field.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""it is often mentioned that"" (should be ""it is often said that""), ""tyhe needs"" (should be ""the needs""), and ""no metter what way of studying you have chosen"" (should be ""no matter what way of studying you have chosen""). These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the student's overall message.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences.

There are several grammatical errors, such as ""I really think that it is not always helpful to learn by heart"" (should be ""I think it is not always helpful to learn by heart""), ""we should be carful of not learn without understanding"" (should be ""we should be careful not to learn without understanding""), and ""in our societz"" (should be ""in our society"").
3.  The writer uses simple vocabulary and lacks variety in sentence structure, which makes the essay seem repetitive and monotonous.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use examples, such as the global warming issue, to support their argument. They also demonstrate an understanding of the potential impact of environmental concerns on societal behavior and the economy. 

However, the essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and sentences often disconnected from one another. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and misuse of prepositions. Additionally, some sentences are worded in a way that is difficult to understand, such as ""it wont take people long time to notice that"" and ""it would be a must and not an option."" 

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements. For instance, they mention that public transportation would become more popular, but do not provide any concrete evidence or examples to back this up.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. They have used examples from history and education systems to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat disconnected from the prompt. The quote ""Education is what remains with you after you finish schooling"" is not directly related to the statement ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."" A more effective introduction would have explicitly stated the student's stance on the prompt and provided a clear thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While they mention Alexander the Great as an example of a historical figure who was overconfident and consumed by his own ambition, they do not provide a clear connection between this example and the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. A more effective example would have shown how understanding ideas and concepts can help students avoid the pitfalls of overconfidence and avarice.

Thirdly, the student's discussion of the education system in India is somewhat tangential to the prompt. While they mention the ""gurukuls"" as an example of an education system that focused on learning and understanding, they do not provide a clear explanation of how this system relates to the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. A more effective discussion would have explicitly stated how the ""gurukuls"" approach to education prioritized understanding over mere memorization.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay that detract from the student's argument and make it difficult to follow.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the writer's arguments. For instance, the mention of teenagers helping the church or local administration during elections and fighting against environmental problems is a good way to illustrate the writer's point. Additionally, the writer has provided a nuanced view by acknowledging that the younger generation's approach to community service may differ from that of previous generations.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or specific examples of community service projects. The writing could also benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. For example, the writer relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the text seem a bit flat.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors that need to be addressed. For instance, the sentence ""The first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely"" could be rephrased to make it more concise and clear. Additionally, the writer could have used more precise language to convey their ideas, such as using ""intergenerational relationships"" instead of ""traditional bonds.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides some relevant points to support this claim, including the increased responsibilities and competition faced by young people, the impact of technological advancements on their lives, and their focus on personal gain.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction could be more effective if it provided a stronger transition to the main argument.

The student has attempted to provide specific examples to support their claims, such as the busy schedules of kids, teenagers, and middle-aged individuals. However, these examples are not always well-integrated into the essay, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the text. For instance, the sentence ""Its only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy"" seems out of place and does not contribute to the main argument.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the impact of technological advancements on young people's lives. The statement ""The change in technology over the past few years has brought a change not only in man's life making things easier for him but also in his way of thinking"" is a general statement that could be developed further.

Additionally, the student could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or real-life examples of young people not contributing to their communities. The essay relies heavily on general statements and management science theory, which, while relevant, do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized the thesis statement. The final sentence ""In such a society people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities. Therefore the author's opinion about the young people not having time to help their communities is very much agreeable"" feels like a repetition of the thesis statement and does not provide a satisfying conclusion.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""there  resouses"" instead of ""there are resources,"" ""forces  people to move away from the cars"" instead of ""may force people to move away from cars,"" and ""lavying"" instead of ""levying."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the limitations of conventional fuels to the government's plans to discourage car use. A clearer transition between ideas would make the essay flow better.

The student also fails to address the counterargument to their position, which is a crucial aspect of a well-structured essay. They only present their own perspective without considering alternative viewpoints.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentences. While this is understandable for a second language learner, it would be beneficial to incorporate more complex sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the essay's overall impact.

However, the student does demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples, such as the shift towards electric and hybrid cars, the environmental impact of car emissions, and the government's role in encouraging public transport.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the soccer player and the founder of Microsoft, to support the writer's argument. These examples are relevant and help to illustrate the point being made. The writer also attempts to provide a nuanced view of success, suggesting that it's not just about achieving recognition, fame, or money.

However, there are several areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the introduction is somewhat vague and doesn't clearly state the writer's position on the statement.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to make the writing more engaging.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""Opinions might exists over whethe most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are"" is grammatically incorrect and should be revised to ""Opinions may exist over whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" This error affects the overall flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas. For example, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph is abrupt, and the student could have used a connecting phrase to link the ideas more smoothly.

In terms of content, the student provides a valid point about the purpose of advertisements being to attract customers and increase selling rates. However, the example provided about the mother's experience with medical advertisements is not entirely convincing, as it is based on a single anecdote and does not provide concrete evidence to support the claim.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the transition from discussing the relativity of ideas and concepts to the importance of facts in a democracy is not smooth. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas more effectively.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate. For example, the phrase ""In my opinion fact is more important than the others"" should be ""In my opinion, facts are more important than ideas and concepts."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""somebody lived or something like that,"" which is a filler phrase that does not contribute to the essay's meaning.

The student also struggles to provide concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention World War II as an example, they do not provide a clear analysis of how this example supports their claim. Instead, they seem to use it as a way to illustrate the relativity of ideas and concepts.

However, the student does attempt to provide a personal anecdote about their experience in the U.S., which shows that they are trying to think critically about the importance of facts. This anecdote also demonstrates their ability to connect their ideas to real-life experiences.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat coherent, but it is not well-supported. They argue that facts are more important than ideas and concepts because they are ""real things"" and cannot be changed. However, they do not provide a clear explanation of why this is the case.

Firstly, the student's introduction is unclear and lacks a direct connection to the prompt. The phrase ""Life is just one, and we have to substract from it all as we can"" is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a personal anecdote that is not fully developed.

For instance, the sentence ""my high school was called ""classic high school"" in opposition with scentific high school"" is confusing, and the use of ""scentific"" instead of ""scientific"" is a clear error.

The student also struggles to provide a clear and well-supported argument for why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. While they mention that understanding ideas and concepts allows for critical thinking and the ability to approach problems in a personal way, this point is not fully developed and could be supported with more evidence.

To improve, the student should focus on directly addressing the prompt and providing more clear and concise writing. They should also work on providing more evidence to support their argument and avoiding grammatical errors.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer agreeing that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer provides several reasons to support their opinion, including physical energy, independence, and a more carefree attitude towards life. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The writer attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""There are various reasons for the opinion I share"" and ""Seconly young people are far more independent than older people.""
- The writer provides some specific examples to support their claims, such as the example of an older person with hearing problems and the contrast between the younger and older generations' attitudes towards money.
- The writer attempts to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""physical energy,"" ""enthusiastic,"" and ""orthodox.""

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The writer's writing is often unclear and lacks coherence. For example, the sentence ""The definition of enjoyment, the very feeling that brings you joy and happiness may defer from one individual to another"" does not contribute to the main argument and seems to be a non-sequitur.
- The writer's use of grammar and punctuation is often incorrect. For example, ""yound"" should be spelled as ""young,"" and there are several instances of missing articles and incorrect verb tenses.
- The writer's examples are not always well-supported or convincing. For example, the claim that older people are more worried about trivial issues is not backed up with evidence.
- The writer's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Evaluation: 

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main reasons for disagreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its,"" ""popurations"" instead of ""population,"" and ""paesantage"" instead of ""percentage."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's arguments are not well-supported by concrete evidence. For instance, the claim that the population will increase from 6.0 billion to 6.5 billion in twenty years is not substantiated by any credible sources. Similarly, the statement that young people are more likely to drive cars now than in the past is not backed up by any specific data or examples.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-linked. For example, the sentence ""With the reasons, I don't agree that, buteven though we have more cars in our future, the fuel will totally change, from oil to electricity or something like that"" is unclear and seems to be a non-sequitur.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. The arguments presented are simplistic and do not take into account the complexities of the issue. For instance, the student fails to consider the potential impact of technological advancements, environmental concerns, and economic factors on the future of car usage.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of examples to support the argument. The student has provided three compelling examples from their own life and from notable figures like Bill Gates to illustrate the importance of taking risks and trying new things.

Strengths:

1.  The student has effectively used specific examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and convincing.
2.  The use of personal anecdotes, such as the student's own experience of coming to America, adds a relatable and authentic touch to the essay.
3.  The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of risk-taking and its relation to success.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly between ideas and fails to provide a logical flow of thoughts.

One of the major issues with the essay is the presence of grammatical errors, such as ""It all dependswath,"" ""I belive,"" ""dificult,"" and ""joung."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the writing and make it challenging to understand the writer's intended message.

The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, but these are often vague and lack concrete evidence. For instance, the statement ""Young people can stay late at night, drinking or dancing"" is a generalization that does not provide a clear connection to the topic. Similarly, the writer's assertion that ""Much young people receive economic support from their parents"" is not supported by any concrete data or examples.

On the other hand, the writer attempts to provide a nuanced perspective on the topic by acknowledging the limitations of older people and the benefits of a more relaxed pace of life. The writer's personal anecdote about preferring quality over quantity is a good attempt to provide a personal perspective, but it feels disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on clichés, such as ""everything in excess is bad."" The writer also struggles to provide a clear conclusion, instead ending the essay with a personal statement that feels disconnected from the rest of the text.

2.  They have acknowledged the environmental concerns associated with car usage, such as ozone layer depletion and resource depletion.
3.  The student has also mentioned the importance of cars in everyday life and the difficulty of living without one, especially in non-urban areas.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The student has used some incorrect vocabulary and grammar, such as ""disparition"" instead of ""decrease"" or ""decline,"" and ""nevetheless"" instead of ""nevertheless.""
3.  The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the environmental concerns to the importance of cars in everyday life.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided specific reasons to support their answer. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their own country, Turkey, to support their argument. The mention of the increase in charity unions and their member numbers is a good example of how the student has done their research and is able to provide evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the student's observation that 3 out of 5 people who join these organizations are in the 18-30 age range is a good example of how young people are still actively involved in helping their communities.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""has much more spare time"" (should be ""have more spare time""), ""has to have a lte night job"" (should be ""have to have a late night job""), and ""betwwen"" (should be ""between""). These errors can make the essay difficult to understand and detract from the student's overall message.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is not always precise. For example, the student uses the phrase ""does not seem to exist as it was 15-20 years ago,"" which is a bit unclear. A more precise phrase might be ""has largely disappeared in recent years.""

Finally, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the past to discussing the present, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the student could use transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow more smoothly.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""Someone think,"" ""But I disagree it,"" ""You will hvat,"" and ""you will fell."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with words like ""negetive"" and ""subjedts"" being used instead of ""negative"" and ""subjects.""

Secondly, the student's arguments could be strengthened by providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims. For instance, the statement ""if everyone all have broad knowledge of many academic subjects"" is unclear and lacks context. Furthermore, the example of a physician knowing many subjects but not being good at one specific subject is an interesting point, but it could be developed further to make it more convincing.

Thirdly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized the thesis statement. The current conclusion seems to be a repetition of the thesis statement without providing a clear summary of the main arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support this claim, which is a positive aspect of the writing.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to use various marketing methods as examples, such as promotions, product launch offers, and door-to-door selling, to support their argument. This shows an understanding of the topic and the ways in which advertisements can be misleading.
2. The student has provided a specific example of an advertisement for a car, highlighting the potential consequences of speeding and the importance of considering the impact on others and the environment. This demonstrates an ability to think critically about the content of advertisements.
3. The student has also mentioned the issue of cultural and religious sensitivities in advertisements, providing an example of an underwear advertisement that may be considered offensive. This shows an awareness of the potential consequences of advertisements on different groups of people.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and organization, with ideas and examples presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. The student jumps between different topics, such as the methods used in advertising, the content of advertisements, and the impact on consumers.
2. The writing is often simplistic and lacks depth, with sentences that are short and lacking in detail. For example, the sentence ""A good add should be planned in a manner to show the use of the car that is how can it help not only you but other people aswell or even the environment"" could be rephrased for greater clarity and effectiveness.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used various examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to illustrate the importance of learning facts, such as the rules that children learn in school. The writer also provides a clear distinction between the importance of learning facts in lower grades and the emphasis on understanding concepts in higher grades. Additionally, the writer raises an interesting point about the role of school in a democracy, highlighting its importance in shaping people's minds.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of learning facts to the role of school in a democracy. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""he learns rules...he understands the consequence of his ations"" and ""it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations to support their arguments. For example, when discussing the importance of understanding concepts, the writer states that it ""develops the cleverness of a student,"" but does not elaborate on what they mean by ""cleverness."" Additionally, the writer could have provided more concrete examples to illustrate the importance of understanding concepts in a student's personal development.

Finally, the writer could have provided a more convincing conclusion that ties together the various points made throughout the essay. The current conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not leave the reader with a lasting impression.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides specific examples from everyday life, such as washing powder and energy bars for sports, to support their argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal experiences to illustrate the point. The student's anecdotes about trying washing powder and energy bars are engaging and help to make the argument more relatable. Additionally, the student's observation of the Ovomaltine advertisement, which presents a more realistic claim, is a good example of a counterargument.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the language is sometimes simple and lacks variety. The student could benefit from using more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively. For example, the sentence ""We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market, which is maybe not true, but people need to believe it to chose our product"" could be rephrased to something like ""Advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of a product, making it seem like the best option available, even if it may not be entirely accurate.""

Furthermore, the student could provide more analysis and explanation of the examples they provide. For instance, they could discuss why they think the advertisements are misleading or how they affect consumers. This would add depth to the essay and make it more convincing.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective. While they mention the Ovomaltine advertisement as an exception, they could summarize their main points and reiterate their stance on the topic more clearly.

Strengths:

1.  The student provides relevant examples from the business world, such as easyJet, to support their argument. This shows an understanding of the concept of innovation and its importance in the business world.
2.  The student acknowledges the opposing view that experience is crucial for success, but effectively counters it by highlighting the importance of adaptation and taking risks in a changing environment.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, and a lack of coherence.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention the common complaints of older people and contrast them with the activities of young people. However, these examples are not fully developed and lack concrete evidence to support their claims.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples, such as the transformer advertisement, to illustrate their points. This shows that they have a good understanding of the topic and can think critically about the ways in which advertisements can be misleading. Additionally, the student uses transitional phrases, such as ""First of all"" and ""Beside that,"" to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. One of the main issues is with grammar and sentence structure. For example, the sentence ""We should know what is advertisement, that is a way to sell the products the company make"" is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased as ""We should know what an advertisement is, which is a way to sell products made by a company."" Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for clarity.

Another area for improvement is in the use of vocabulary. While the student uses some good vocabulary, such as ""attractive"" and ""affection,"" there are also some errors, such as ""anotrher"" instead of ""another."" Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to make the essay more engaging and interesting to read.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, the example of IT industries adapting to the new environment and Ichiro Suzuki's continuous improvement of his batting method are effective in illustrating the importance of trying new things and taking risks. The writer also attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, which is a good practice.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's grammar and vocabulary are not always accurate. For example, ""I think success has a great deal to do with factor of adaptation to the new environment"" should be ""I think success has a great deal to do with the factor of adapting to a new environment."" Additionally, ""The invention of Internet makes world borderless and email shortens the time to convey the information"" could be rephrased to ""The invention of the internet has made the world borderless, and email has shortened the time it takes to convey information.""

Furthermore, the writer's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of adapting to the new environment to talking about improving one's methods. A clearer transition between these ideas would make the essay flow better. Additionally, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of their points.

The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. However, the student has provided some relevant points to support their argument, such as the potential for advertisements to exaggerate product quality and the influence of marketing professionals on the advertising process.

One of the major issues with the essay is the student's failure to address the prompt directly.

Instead, the student focuses on the motivations behind advertisements and the potential consequences of their persuasive nature.

A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the thesis and provided a roadmap for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For example, the transition from discussing young people's enjoyment of life to discussing older people's enjoyment of life is abrupt. The student could have used phrases like ""However,"" ""In contrast,"" or ""On the other hand"" to connect the ideas more smoothly.

Thirdly, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases like ""we can see that,"" ""so it's true to say that,"" and ""in the same time"" are overused and lack precision. The student could have used more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the experiences of young and older people.

Lastly, the conclusion feels somewhat repetitive and doesn't effectively summarize the main points. The student could have rephrased the thesis statement and provided a more nuanced conclusion that ties together the ideas presented in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do,"" and provided three main reasons to support their argument: older people have more leisure time, more money, and better life management. However, the essay has several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and logical flow. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. For instance, the first paragraph introduces the idea that older people have more leisure time, but the second paragraph jumps to the topic of money without a clear link. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""yound people"" should be ""young people,"" ""efi"" should be ""effectively,"" and ""cramming for exams"" is a more common phrase than ""cramming for exams."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples and supporting evidence is limited. While the student provides some examples, such as students working on assignments and young people struggling for survival, these examples are not well-developed and lack specific details. The student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The student could have rephrased the conclusion to provide a more cohesive summary of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic and supporting it with some examples. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the connection between the ideas is not well-established. The student jumps from discussing the development of flying cars and public transportation to stating their disagreement with the statement. A more logical connection between the ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For example, ""Howevere"" should be spelled as ""However,"" and ""formly"" should be spelled as ""formally."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""each person will have own car,"" which should be ""each person will have their own car."" These errors in grammar and punctuation detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and not always relevant to the topic. While the example about Seoul, Korea, is interesting, it is not directly related to the topic of cars in use in the next twenty years. The student could have provided more relevant examples to support their argument.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. The student states that they do not agree with the statement, but then goes on to suggest ways in which the number of cars could be reduced. A clearer conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the student's stance would be more effective.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides two main reasons to support this stance: the complexity of the modern world and the changing family structure.

Strengths:

1.  The student attempts to provide specific reasons to support their opinion, which is a crucial aspect of essay writing.
2.  They acknowledge the complexity of the modern world and its impact on young people's lives, which is a valid point.
3.  The student also touches on the idea that a traditional family structure can foster a sense of community and solidarity, which is a thought-provoking point.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected.
2.  The student uses several grammatical errors, such as ""enought"" instead of ""enough,"" ""hepling"" instead of ""helping,"" and ""youg"" instead of ""young."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.
3.  The student's writing style is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the phrase ""this fact doesn't help youg people to develope their sense of comunity"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.
4.  The conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the essay to improve its coherence and clarity by using transitional phrases and connecting ideas more effectively.
2.  Edit the essay for grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

3.  The student has demonstrated an understanding of the environmental impact of cars, mentioning the release of carbon dioxide and the importance of reducing pollution.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing is often simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of complex vocabulary. For example, the phrase ""people reduce to drive cars by themselves"" could be rephrased as ""people reduce their reliance on personal vehicles.""
2.  There are some grammatical errors, such as ""vital reseason"" (should be ""vital reason"") and ""priceless time"" (should be ""precious time"").
3.  The student could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of their points, rather than relying on general statements.

Suggestions for improvement:

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, which is a good start. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it challenging to follow the argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the presence of grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, ""unnccessary"" should be spelled as ""unnecessary,"" ""anybody"" should be ""anyone,"" and ""ti"" should be ""too."" These errors undermine the credibility of the writer and make it difficult for the reader to take the argument seriously.

The writer attempts to provide examples to support their argument, but they are not well-developed or convincing. The example about hiring someone for a marketing position is unclear and lacks context. The writer also fails to provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that specializing in one subject is more beneficial than having broad knowledge of many subjects.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentences and phrases. For instance, the phrase ""it is more useful to have the knowledge"" is a vague statement that does not add much value to the argument. The writer also uses colloquial expressions, such as ""golden age for your appreciate,"" which are not suitable for academic writing.

Despite these issues, the writer attempts to provide a clear and concise conclusion, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and dedication to one's goals. However, this conclusion feels disconnected from the rest of the essay, and the writer fails to summarize their main points effectively.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""I am not agree with this idea alwase,"" ""beacuse,"" ""woud like,"" ""god sex relationship,"" ""bee have,"" and ""howse."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of traveling with family and car to mentioning the advantages of group travel. The student also fails to provide concrete examples to support their claims, relying on vague statements such as ""it will be a very intresting travel"" and ""use from the guide of a leader is very usfull and intresting.""

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. For instance, when discussing the benefits of group travel, the student mentions the opportunity to meet new people, but fails to elaborate on how this experience can be beneficial. Additionally, the student's statement about traveling to the U.S.A. seems out of place and unrelated to the original prompt.

The student's writing also suffers from a lack of cohesion and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing travel to mentioning financial problems in the student's country, which seems unrelated to the original topic. The student's closing sentence, ""If i have som mony, I will com to your country (U. S. A.), the land of wishes,"" comes across as a non-sequitur and detracts from the overall impact of the essay.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, providing both arguments for and against the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer presents a unique perspective, suggesting that older people may enjoy life more due to their life experiences and ability to appreciate the value of life. This is supported by a relevant example from the book ""Tuesdays with Morrie,"" which highlights the importance of learning to let go and appreciate life's experiences.

However, the essay is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. The writer struggles with verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation, making it challenging to follow their arguments at times. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, which affects the overall flow of the essay.

The writer also fails to provide a clear and concise thesis statement, which would have helped to guide the reader through the essay and provide a clear direction for the arguments presented. Furthermore, some of the supporting examples, such as the comparison between young people and those with limited economic resources, feel somewhat disconnected from the main argument and could be more effectively integrated into the essay.

Despite these challenges, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some thoughtful insights into the relationship between age and enjoyment of life. With further practice and attention to grammar and sentence structure, the writer has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The writer has effectively used specific examples to support their arguments, such as the importance of broad knowledge in professional and personal life. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the importance of specialization, which shows a nuanced understanding of the topic. The writer also uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, making the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are some grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as ""thougths"" instead of ""thoughts,"" ""wolud"" instead of ""would,"" and ""peolpe"" instead of ""people."" These errors can make the essay difficult to read and understand.

Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and concision. For example, the sentence ""It is essential to share ideas and thougths with others"" could be rephrased as ""Sharing ideas and thoughts with others is essential."" Furthermore, some of the sentences are a bit long and convoluted, making them hard to follow.

The writer also uses some idiomatic expressions, such as ""a plus in life"" and ""keep a goal to our life,"" which are not entirely accurate. However, the writer's effort to use idiomatic expressions is commendable.

In terms of content, the writer provides some good examples, but they could be more specific and detailed. For instance, instead of saying ""it is very agreable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new,"" the writer could provide a specific example of a situation where broad knowledge helped them in a social interaction.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, providing three main points to support their disagreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and cohesion. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing new energy resources to the convenience systems in cars, and then to the growth of population. A more logical flow of ideas and transitional phrases would improve the essay's overall structure.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For instance, ""developong"" should be ""developing,"" ""demamds"" should be ""demands,"" ""technoligies"" should be ""technologies,"" and ""stromg"" should be ""strong."" Additionally, there are several instances of subject-verb agreement errors, such as ""the convenient systems in cars are enhancing its ability"" (should be ""the convenient systems in cars enhance its ability"").

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is not always effective. While the example of solar energy and hydrogen energy is a good start, it is not fully developed. The student could have provided more information about how these energy sources will be implemented and how they will benefit car users. Similarly, the example of the subway in New Delhi, India, is not clearly connected to the growth of population and its impact on car demand.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific examples to support their argument.

However, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow, making it challenging to follow the student's line of reasoning. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and poor sentence structure.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's failure to directly address the prompt. The prompt asks for an opinion on whether traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel, but the student's response is a meandering narrative that uses a dream scenario to make a point. While the student attempts to use the situation to illustrate the problems with group travel, the connection between the anecdote and the prompt is tenuous at best.

Furthermore, the student's writing is often unclear and lacks supporting evidence. For example, when discussing the difficulties of traveling in a group, the student states that ""the members of a group are divers, as a consequence, it is hard to set a time good for everyone."" However, this statement is not supported by any concrete examples or evidence, making it difficult to understand the student's point.

Additionally, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. For instance, the student writes ""Imagne one situation"" instead of ""Imagine one situation,"" and ""rediculous"" instead of ""ridiculous."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Despite these issues, the student does attempt to provide some coherent arguments against traveling in a group led by a tour guide. For example, the student argues that traveling in a group can be restrictive and that group members may be forced to visit places they do not find interesting. However, these arguments are not fully developed and are often undermined by the student's own narrative.

They have provided two main reasons to support their argument: the development of public transportation in cities and the increasing demand for cars in developing countries to support economic growth.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction is brief and does not provide a clear overview of the main points that will be discussed.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a more logical flow of ideas. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the development of public transportation in cities to the increasing demand for cars in developing countries. A transitional phrase or sentence could help to connect these ideas more smoothly.

Furthermore, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which can make it difficult to understand at times. For example, ""particulary"" should be spelled as ""particularly,"" ""similary"" should be spelled as ""similarly,"" and ""commerese"" should be spelled as ""commerce."" Additionally, the sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, which can make the writing seem a bit flat.

In terms of content, the student's arguments are not particularly well-supported. While they mention the development of public transportation in cities and the increasing demand for cars in developing countries, they do not provide any concrete evidence or statistics to back up these claims.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher score. The writer presents a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the writer's arguments.

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear structure. The essay jumps between ideas without a logical flow, making it difficult to understand the writer's train of thought. For instance, the writer starts by stating their age and then shifts to a comparison with their grandparents' generation without connecting the two ideas. This lack of coherence affects the overall clarity of the writer's arguments.

Another issue is the use of vague language and general statements. The writer claims that young people help old people when they need assistance, but does not provide specific examples to support this claim. Similarly, the writer states that going to school is not directly helping the community, but fails to elaborate on this point. Providing concrete examples and explanations would strengthen the writer's arguments and make them more convincing.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the writer uses ""That is right that"" instead of ""I agree that,"" and ""enought"" instead of ""enough."" These errors make the essay appear less polished and less professional.

Despite these challenges, the writer attempts to address the prompt and provides some relevant points, such as the importance of education in contributing to the community's well-being. However, these points are not fully developed, and the writer fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The writer has also attempted to use specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a commendable effort. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the essay to a higher level.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to present a balanced view on the topic, acknowledging both the benefits of broad knowledge and specialization. The writer has also provided some relevant examples, such as the importance of adapting to market changes and the need for lifelong learning. However, the examples could be more effectively integrated into the essay to support the writer's arguments.

There are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with errors in verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For instance, the writer uses ""I think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing"" instead of ""I think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing: if you are open-minded and can discuss many topics..."" The writer also uses ""workers (and here I refere also to managers, and people who have great responsabilities)"" instead of ""workers, including managers and people with great responsibilities.""

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are opportunities to use more precise and technical terms. For example, instead of using ""macro-economic problems,"" the writer could use ""macroeconomic fluctuations"" or ""economic downturns."" Additionally, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion could be more effectively summarized, and the writer could have provided a more definitive stance on the topic.

The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, stating that young people enjoy life more than older people due to various reasons. The writer effectively uses specific examples from their personal life, such as comparing their father and brother, to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, the comparison between the writer's father and brother effectively illustrates the idea that young people have more freedom and opportunities to enjoy life. Additionally, the writer acknowledges that people have different traits, customs, and lifestyles, which is a valid point that adds depth to the discussion.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks cohesion. For example, the sentence ""when faced with the decison of who enjoys more, quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more and that is my point"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. Furthermore, the writer often uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks varied vocabulary, which makes the essay seem less engaging.

Another area for improvement is the organization of the essay. The writer jumps between ideas and does not provide a clear transition between paragraphs. For instance, the paragraph that starts with ""There is another factor that deserves some mention here"" seems disconnected from the previous paragraph. Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements.

Lastly, the writer could have provided a more nuanced conclusion that ties together the main points made in the essay. The final sentence, ""but that doesn't means older people don't have fun. they do. sometimes more than young people,"" feels like an afterthought and could be rephrased for better impact.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. They have provided several reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a good start. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to think critically and consider multiple perspectives, such as the potential drawbacks of guided tours (e.g., biased guides). They also demonstrate an understanding of the benefits of group travel, including the opportunity to learn from others and gain a deeper understanding of the place.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For example, ""A guided tour is always a preferd tour"" should be ""A guided tour is always a preferred tour."" Additionally, the student often uses simplistic vocabulary, such as ""fun, learning, and longlasting"" instead of more precise terms like ""enjoyable,"" ""educational,"" and ""lasting.""

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking between paragraphs. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of guided tours to mentioning potential drawbacks, without providing a clear transition. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or unclear, such as ""If you consider saving the guide charges by not hiring him then the money spent on coming to the place may go in vain since you would have only visited the place but do not know any thing more about the place than what you have seen."" This sentence could be rephrased for clarity.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. They provide three main reasons to support their argument: the importance of broad knowledge in a specific profession, the flexibility that comes with a broad knowledge base, and the need for a well-rounded citizen in a modern society.

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student has attempted to use specific examples to support their arguments, such as the librarian example and the example of a person switching careers.
- They have demonstrated an understanding of the concept of a ""gentleman"" and its relevance to the topic.
- The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear thesis statement and supporting it with reasons and examples.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. They have also attempted to use specific reasons and examples to support their answer. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided a clear and concise thesis statement in the introduction, stating that a good academic formation can be reached in two ways: broad knowledge and specific knowledge.
2. They have used personal experiences and examples to support their argument, such as their own education in Italy and their future career aspirations as a manager.
3. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of flexibility in the modern work environment and has provided a relevant example of how a manager might need to find creative solutions to problems.

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""flessible"" instead of ""flexible,"" ""teorized"" instead of ""theorized,"" and ""konw"" instead of ""know.""
2. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""interesting"" and ""realize"" being used in a somewhat generic way.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the argument. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal experience as an advertiser to provide a unique perspective on the issue. The student shares a relatable anecdote about a shampoo advertisement that failed to deliver its promised results, making the argument more engaging and authentic. Additionally, the student attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their claim, such as the government's lack of control over advertisements and the potential harm caused by misleading medical and food ads.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The ideas are not fully connected, and the student jumps abruptly from one point to another. For instance, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph is unclear, and the third paragraph seems to be a separate idea that is not fully integrated into the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary and grammar need improvement. There are several errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and word choice. For example, ""A little over than fact, nothing big deal"" should be ""A little more than fact, no big deal."" Additionally, ""canl"" should be ""can't"" and ""persude"" should be ""persuade.""

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat vague and lacks a clear call to action. The final sentence, ""We can believe, with the more goverment's and all people's support, no one buy these products, no benifits, the problem can be sloved,"" is unclear and contains several errors.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, their essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherence in their writing. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to articulate their thoughts clearly. The writing is often fragmented, with sentences that are incomplete or lack proper connections between ideas. For instance, the student states, ""It is clear the student lern more his ideas and concepts rather then the facts in classrooms."" This sentence is unclear and does not make sense in the context of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions and slang. For example, ""I feel the student understad ideas and concepts then facts"" is a sentence that could be rephrased to convey the same idea in a more formal and polished manner.

In terms of content, the student attempts to provide examples to support their argument, but these examples are often disconnected from the main topic. The discussion on the solar system and the concept of energy transfer is interesting, but it is not clearly linked to the main argument. The student also struggles to provide a clear and concise conclusion, instead reiterating their initial statement without summarizing their main points.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, agreeing that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

The student provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, including the emphasis on individualism, the value placed on spare time, and the detachment between young people and older generations or those in need.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Being committet"" (should be ""committed""), ""altogehter"" (should be ""altogether""), and ""frredom"" (should be ""freedom""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, some of the sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""In other words, we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves, feel free in our choices and simply follow instant gratification"" could be simplified to ""We feel it is our right to enjoy ourselves and follow our desires without hesitation.""

Additionally, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments. While they mention the concept of self-absorption and pleasure, they do not provide specific instances or anecdotes to illustrate this point.

The student has made a good effort to express their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. They have provided two main reasons to support their argument: the development of application skills and the enjoyment of studying. 

Firstly, the student has effectively used a clear and concise structure to organize their ideas. They have introduced their topic with a clear thesis statement and supported it with two main points. However, the student could have provided more evidence and examples to strengthen their arguments. For instance, they could have provided more specific examples of how understanding concepts leads to better application skills or how it makes studying more enjoyable.

Secondly, the student has demonstrated a good command of vocabulary and grammar, but there are some errors that need to be corrected. For example, ""Of course, students have to learn facts from teachers and memorize them"" should be ""Of course, students have to learn facts from teachers and memorize them."" (missing verb ""memorize""). Additionally, ""appication skills"" should be ""application skills"" throughout the essay. The student also uses some informal expressions such as ""We know the cause of this situation"" which is not suitable for an academic essay.

Thirdly, the student has shown some good critical thinking skills by analyzing the Japanese education system and comparing it to other countries.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writer jumps between unrelated ideas, making it challenging to follow their argument. 

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer starts by mentioning the world's problems, but then shifts to the topic of young people's responsibility towards their cultures and societies. This transition is not smooth, and the connection between the two ideas is not explicitly stated.

The writer attempts to provide examples, such as the increase in failure rates in Senior-high school in the Middle East, but these examples are not effectively linked to the main argument. The writer seems to be trying to make a point about the lack of responsibility among young people, but the connection to the initial statement about young people not giving enough time to helping their communities is tenuous at best.

Furthermore, the writer's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""At the mean time,"" ""imaturity and irrespnosibilty,"" ""poeple,"" and ""reponsibilities."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning.

The writer also struggles to provide a clear conclusion, ending with a sentence that seems to be a non-sequitur (""humans are the ones who are suppose to hold the responsibilities...""). This lack of a clear conclusion undermines the overall effectiveness of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a balanced view on the topic. They acknowledge the importance of specialization, but also highlight the benefits of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The use of examples, such as journalism and teaching, is effective in illustrating the points being made.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often simplistic, and the vocabulary is not always precise. For example, the phrase ""some fields that can also attract them a lot"" could be rephrased to ""some fields that can also capture their interest."" Additionally, the sentence structure is sometimes awkward, such as in the sentence ""On a personal point of view, this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis in their arguments. For instance, they mention that some jobs require knowledge in many academic fields, but they do not elaborate on what specific skills or knowledge are required for these jobs.

However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity, with several grammatical errors and sentence structure issues. The student's writing is also marred by a lack of precise vocabulary and incorrect word usage (e.g., ""is more to have,"" ""I thing,"" ""specifict,"" ""do you really get to know a specific thing,"" ""became a profecional,"" ""people whant,"" ""persond,"" ""its,"" etc.).

Despite these challenges, the student has made an effort to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They argue that specializing in one subject allows for in-depth knowledge and the opportunity to work in a field of interest, which can lead to success and personal fulfillment. The student also suggests that having broad knowledge of many subjects may not be as effective, as it requires a lifetime of study and may lead to wasted time if one is not genuinely interested in the subject matter.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on whether most advertisements make products seem better or worse than they really are. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""poaple"" instead of ""people,"" ""mush"" instead of ""much,"" and ""differ"" instead of ""differently."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. 

Furthermore, the student's arguments are not well-supported. The statement that advertisements make products seem better than they really are is not adequately explained. The student mentions that advertisements aim to create a reputation for the company and attract consumers' attention, but these points are not developed further. The example provided about young ladies buying medicine online is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a tangent. 

Additionally, the student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-linked. The student also uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks variety in vocabulary. 

The student's conclusion is also unclear, as they seem to be advocating for buying products based on personal recommendations rather than addressing the original statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. They provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a positive aspect of their essay. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""With the television and the others mass media in the last 50's years"" (should be ""In the last 50 years, we have seen a development of advertisements through television and other mass media""), ""It is troue tought"" (should be ""It is true that""), and ""sametimes"" (should be ""sometimes""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, with words like ""adrevrtisement"" (should be ""advertisement""), ""peaple"" (should be ""people""), and ""psicologically"" (should be ""psychologically""). While the student attempts to use examples to support their argument, the language used is not sophisticated enough to convey their ideas effectively.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the role of advertisements to criticizing the cigarette industry. A clearer transition between ideas would make the essay flow better.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They state that customers should think before buying something, but this does not directly relate to the main argument about advertisements making products seem better than they really are.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides two main reasons to support their argument: the desire for respect from others and the growing concern for the environment.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer struggles with grammar and sentence structure, which affects the clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, in the first paragraph, the sentence ""For example, some Tokyo universtiy students who live near my city nowadays  began to clean the river-side.They ususlly come to rive-side to bring up trashes, cans desposed on it."" is difficult to understand due to the numerous errors in verb tense and punctuation. Similarly, in the second paragraph, the sentence ""As the result, the river became vey clean"" should be ""As a result, the river became very clean.""

Furthermore, the writer's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, the phrase ""I strongly believe that"" is repeated twice, which makes the essay seem less varied and engaging. Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples to support their arguments, rather than relying on vague statements such as ""the people in the area appreicated to them very much.""

Despite these challenges, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples to support their argument. However, the essay would benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure to make it more effective and engaging.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas, particularly in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. The writer presents some relevant points to support their argument, but the organization and connection between ideas could be more effective.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide examples from various contexts, such as business, daily life, and personal growth. The comparison between the immune system and human experiences is an interesting and creative way to illustrate the importance of taking risks. Additionally, the writer acknowledges the value of experience in finding solutions to problems.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writing is often unclear, with sentences that are grammatically incorrect or lack coherence. For instance, the sentence ""How is is to be acchieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced"" is confusing and should be rephrased. The writer also struggles with vocabulary, using words like ""bussiness"" and ""persepective"" that are not commonly used in English.

Furthermore, the writer's argument is not always well-supported. The statement ""life consisting of eating and sleeping is not worth living"" is a subjective opinion that is not clearly connected to the main argument. The writer also makes a vague statement about the difference between humans and plants, which seems out of place in the essay.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. They should also work on organizing their ideas more effectively and providing more concrete evidence to support their arguments.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of broad knowledge over specializing in one specific subject. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, particularly in the introduction and conclusion. The sentences are often fragmented, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the first sentence ""My opinion about the having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better tahn the speciallizing i one specific subject"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""broad knowledge could open our horizen"" should be ""broad knowledge could broaden our horizons."" Additionally, ""we would benifity"" should be ""we would benefit."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples to support their argument is limited and lacks depth. While they mention that a lawyer needs knowledge of law, economics, and humanity, they do not provide a clear explanation of how this broad knowledge is beneficial in a real-world scenario. Furthermore, the example of choosing a major is not directly related to the topic and seems to be a personal anecdote rather than a relevant example.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of their main points. The final sentence ""To sum up, though one specific subject is a skill for cerntain people to use like painte, I still draw the conclution that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. They have provided three main reasons to support their argument: young people have less spare time, older people have more friends, and older people have less living pressures. 

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The ideas are not well-connected, and the text jumps abruptly from one point to another. For instance, the transition from the first point to the second point is abrupt, and the student could have used a linking sentence to connect the ideas. 

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences and basic phrases. For example, the phrase ""I think that young people do not enjoy their life more than the older people do"" could be rephrased to ""In my opinion, older people enjoy life more than young people do."" This would make the writing more sophisticated and engaging. 

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While they provide personal anecdotes, they do not fully develop the examples to support their argument. For instance, the example of the student's father and grandmother could be expanded to provide more insight into how their lifestyles compare.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main points and restate the thesis statement in a more nuanced way.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three reasons to support their stance on trying new things. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the first paragraph starts with ""If I was asked whether I prefer try new things or don't try,"" which is a sentence fragment and should be rephrased for clarity. Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions such as ""I will be able to get more highly advantage"" and ""I think to serrect many things"" detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""If my age would have been more higher"" should be ""If I were older,"" and ""To try more difficult ploblem"" should be ""To tackle more difficult problems."" Furthermore, the student's use of sentence structure is often simplistic, with a reliance on short, simple sentences that lack variety.

Thirdly, the student's examples are not well-developed and lack specificity. For instance, the statement ""To get more highly advantage, For example I can change more high salary work and get more bigger house"" is vague and does not provide a clear example of how trying new things can lead to greater advantages.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know. The writer provides two examples from different fields, Dhirubhai Ambani and Sachin Tendulkar, to support their argument. 

Strengths of the essay include:

1. The writer clearly states their opinion and provides specific examples to back it up, which is a good practice for second language learners.
2. The writer attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""Firstly"" and ""Secondly,"" which shows an effort to organize their thoughts.
3. The writer uses vocabulary like ""legend,"" ""master,"" and ""renown"" to describe the individuals they are discussing, which demonstrates some level of language proficiency.

Weaknesses of the essay include:

1. The writer's writing style is somewhat simplistic and lacks coherence, making it difficult to follow at times. For example, the transition between the two examples is abrupt, and the writer jumps between ideas without fully developing them.

The student has demonstrated a clear attempt to address the prompt and provide a well-structured essay. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the student has shown a good understanding of the topic by presenting both sides of the argument, starting with the benefits of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and then highlighting the limitations of this approach. The student has also provided specific examples from their own experience, such as learning about various topics at school, which is a good way to engage the reader.

However, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. For instance, ""It is difficult  to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject"" could be rephrased to ""It is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject."" Additionally, ""I have learn"" should be ""I have learned"" and ""academis"" should be ""academic.""

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as ""That is to say that, somebody who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, is specialized in nothing."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""In other words, someone with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not specialized in anything.""

The student's conclusion is also somewhat unclear, as they seem to be advocating for specializing in one subject while also emphasizing the importance of being aware of other subjects. A clearer conclusion would be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

Firstly, the student's disagreement with the statement is not clearly articulated, and the essay meanders through a discussion of using a microwave, which is unrelated to the topic. The student seems to be confusing the idea of specializing in a subject with the process of solving a problem, which is not the focus of the prompt.

The student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak, and the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the microwave to stating that specializing in one subject is better, without providing any logical connection between the two ideas. The student also uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which makes the essay seem more like a list of disconnected thoughts rather than a cohesive argument.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, the student uses the phrase ""it is imagine"" instead of ""it is imagined,"" and ""hte"" instead of ""the."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student does attempt to provide some reasons to support their argument, such as the need to ""judge about the subject"" and ""deal with specific step.""

The writer provides several reasons to support this claim, including the social life, recreational activities, and opportunities available to young people. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization, as the writer jumps between different ideas without clear transitions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, the writer mentions university life, social organizations, and vacations as opportunities for young people to enjoy themselves. These examples are relevant and help to illustrate the writer's point.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the writing could be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. For example, the writer uses simple sentences repeatedly, which can make the text seem a bit flat. Secondly, the writer could provide more nuanced and detailed explanations of their points. For example, when discussing the benefits of university life, the writer could explain how the social environment and recreational activities contribute to young people's enjoyment of life.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from using more precise vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. For instance, instead of saying ""they only enjoy certain times,"" the writer could say ""they tend to have limited social interactions.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use a relatable example from the real world, specifically the scenario of a company hiring a candidate with a master's degree in Chemical Engineering versus one with a diploma in both Chemical and Biological Engineering. This example effectively illustrates the importance of specialization in a competitive job market.

A clearer transition between paragraphs would improve the overall flow of the essay.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For instance, the phrase ""what i try to mean is"" is a non-standard expression, and ""definitly"" should be spelled as ""definitely."" Furthermore, the sentence structure could be improved to make it more concise and clear.

Firstly, the student starts by introducing the topic and stating their opinion, but the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. A more effective introduction would have provided a concise summary of the main points to be discussed.

The student provides two main reasons to support their opinion: the importance of specialists in handling complex subjects and the ease of accessing information, making the generalist's role less significant. While these points are relevant, they could be developed further with more specific examples and evidence to strengthen their argument.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of cohesion and coherence between the ideas. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the role of specialists to the ease of accessing information, without connecting the two ideas effectively. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two examples from their personal experiences as a foreign exchange trader and a tennis player. However, their argument is somewhat unclear and lacks coherence. The student seems to be arguing that success is based on knowledge and experience rather than taking risks and trying new things. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clarity in the thesis statement. The student starts by disagreeing with the statement, but then proceeds to provide examples that seem to support the opposing view. For instance, the student mentions that as a foreign exchange trader, they analyze data and control risks, which implies that they are taking calculated risks rather than simply doing what they already know how to do well. Similarly, in the tennis example, the student does not try new serve styles when they want to win, which suggests that they are choosing to stick with what they know rather than taking a risk.

The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""I disagree to the statements"" (should be ""I disagree with the statement""), ""the analyzing"" (should be ""analyzing""), ""the racio of wining"" (should be ""ratio of winning""), and ""occers"" (should be ""occurs""). Additionally, the student uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures, which makes the writing seem flat and unengaging.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use simple and straightforward language to convey their ideas. The writer also attempts to provide specific examples to support their claims, such as the idea that young people are mobile and have the energy to engage in various activities. Additionally, the writer highlights the potential drawbacks of being older, such as health problems and a lack of mobility.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with many instances of incorrect or informal language, such as ""In my definition,"" ""with me to discuss this issue,"" and ""ohter hand."" The writer also struggles with sentence structure, often using simple sentences that lack variety and interest. Furthermore, some of the writer's points, such as the idea that young people are ""twenty first century people"" and utilize the latest technology, feel somewhat superficial and lack concrete evidence to support the claim.

In terms of coherence, the writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing clear transitions or connections between paragraphs. For example, the writer moves from discussing the mobility of young people to the idea that they have the opportunity to make new friends, without explaining how these two ideas are related.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their personal opinion on the statement. However, their essay lacks a clear and organized structure, which makes it challenging to follow their argument. The student starts by referencing a question, but fails to directly address the prompt. The essay then meanders through various points, including the student's personal experience, their desire to major in physics, and the difficulties of life in Ecuador.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and relevance to the prompt. The student jumps between different ideas without providing a clear connection between them. For instance, the student mentions the importance of having knowledge in many subjects to find a job, but then shifts to their personal experience of studying physics and the difficulties of life in Ecuador. This lack of coherence makes it difficult to understand the student's argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""I am a high school student hopping to get accepted in a university"" should be ""I am a high school student hoping to get accepted into a university."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""The life is like fill with stones"" which should be ""Life is like a path filled with stones.""

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides several examples to support their argument, including volunteering, caring for people and animals, and participating in community activities. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The writer attempts to use specific examples to support their argument, such as the news report in Taiwan about students volunteering and the incident of animal abuse.
- The writer tries to provide a contrast between the past and present, highlighting the change in attitudes towards volunteering and community involvement among young people in Taiwan.
- The writer attempts to engage the reader with personal anecdotes, such as the example of their friend joining a dance club.

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The essay lacks coherence and logical flow, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
- The writer struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, with several errors throughout the essay (e.g. ""nowadys"" instead of ""nowadays"", ""sacrafice"" instead of ""sacrifice"", ""coummunities"" instead of ""communities"", etc.).
- The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive phrases and sentences that could be rephrased for greater clarity and impact.
- The writer's examples, while well-intentioned, are not always convincing or well-supported. For example, the anecdote about the friend joining a dance club is not directly related to the topic of community service.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided some relevant reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

Strengths:

- The student has provided specific examples from their personal experience, such as participating in a charity project and being a member of a social club, to support their argument.
- They have shown an understanding of the importance of young people in society and their potential to make a positive impact.
- The student has attempted to address the counterargument that young people may not have enough time to help their communities, providing a valid explanation for their own situation.

Weaknesses:

- The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The student's opinion is not explicitly stated until the final paragraph.
- There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""Youth represents a large percentage of the world population"" (should be ""Youth represents a large percentage of the world's population""), ""most of these organization are constitute of young people"" (should be ""most of these organizations are composed of young people""), and ""Young poeple are usualy highly motivated"" (should be ""Young people are usually highly motivated"").
- The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The ideas seem to jump abruptly from one topic to another.
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain unclear phrasing, such as ""But that does not mean that I don't want to, or that I find that helping my community is that not that important"" (should be ""But that doesn't mean I don't want to, or that I don't think helping my community is not important"").
- The student could have provided more evidence to support their argument, such as statistics or examples of successful community projects initiated by young people.

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, but their essay requires significant improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student has failed to directly address the prompt and instead has taken a detour by classifying humans into two categories. Although this classification is an interesting idea, it is not directly related to the prompt. The student could have used examples of successful people who took risks and tried new things to support their argument.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""The Homo sapiens can be broadly classifed into two categories"" (should be ""classified""), ""charaterstic"" (should be ""characteristic""), ""WHOLE"" (should be ""whole""), ""WHY"" (should be ""why""), and ""ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violence movements"" (should be ""non-violence movement""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and lacks depth. While they mention notable figures like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, and Mahatma Gandhi, they fail to provide specific details about how these individuals took risks and tried new things. For instance, they could have explained how Einstein's theory of relativity was a risk he took or how Edison's numerous failed experiments led to his success.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the two categories of humans to providing examples of successful people. A clearer connection between the two ideas would have strengthened the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, effectively expressing their opinion with supporting examples. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a relevant example, such as the global warming issue, to illustrate the point that understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a deeper interest in the subject. The student also highlights the importance of an inspiring teacher and the role of self-confidence in the learning process.

However, there are several areas that need attention. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""he is able to increase his knowledge easily"" and ""he will without doubt learn facts"" are somewhat simplistic and could be replaced with more precise language. Additionally, some sentences are worded in a way that makes them difficult to understand, such as ""It is also importent, to have an inspiring teacher who knows, how to fascinate his students."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""It is also important to have an inspiring teacher who knows how to engage his students.""

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations. For instance, the student mentions that understanding an idea or concept can lead to a deeper interest in the subject, but they do not elaborate on what this deeper interest entails or how it manifests in the learning process.

Lastly, there are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in sentence structure that detract from the overall clarity of the essay. For example, the sentence ""If he once understand an idea, the student is able to"" is incomplete and should be rephrased for clarity.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the statement. The essay is well-structured, and the student has used specific reasons and examples to support their argument. The student has also shown an ability to think critically and provide a nuanced perspective on the issue.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to narrow down the scope of the statement by specifying a particular geographical and cultural setting. This shows that the student is aware of the importance of context in understanding the issue. The student has also provided a clear explanation of the challenges faced by young people in their home country, including the impact of the macroeconomic revolution and outsourcing of jobs.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and grammar. For example, the sentence ""most of these changes result into challenges and demands imposed over individuals of all ages"" could be rephrased to ""most of these changes result in challenges and demands imposed on individuals of all ages."" Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples of how young people are spending less time helping their communities, rather than just stating that they do.

The student's use of vocabulary is also somewhat limited, with some words and phrases being used incorrectly. For example, ""macroconomy revolution"" should be ""macroeconomic revolution,"" and ""mantain"" should be ""maintain."" Furthermore, the student could have used more varied sentence structures to make the writing more engaging.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and well-supported argument. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of language and grammar.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, stating their opinion on the given statement.
2.  They have attempted to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, which is in line with the prompt requirements.
3.  The student has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of taking risks and trying new things for success, as well as the need for caution and consideration of the time and place.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks coherence and flow, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas. For example, the first paragraph introduces the thesis statement, but the second paragraph seems disconnected from the first.
2.  The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, ""If somebody is really successful, he/she should not only  manage something that he/she is supposed to do but she should always improve his/herself and have an aim to make innovations by the means of self-optimisation.""
3.  The student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""I regard this statement as true because I have a quite different definition of success"" could be rephrased to ""In my opinion, the statement is true because I have a distinct understanding of what it means to be successful.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of transitional phrases to connect paragraphs. The student provides specific examples, such as the KFC advertisement and the automobile industry controversy, to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of vivid language and imagery, which helps to engage the reader. For instance, the description of the ""mansion draped in greenery"" is a powerful example of how advertisements can be misleading. The student also shows an understanding of the impact of commercialization on advertising, highlighting how it has led to a competitive environment where companies feel the need to enhance their products.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the issue, rather than simply presenting examples. For instance, they could have explored the reasons behind the trend of exaggerating product features or discussed the consequences of this practice on consumers. Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

The student's use of vocabulary is generally good, with some impressive expressions such as ""relentless wrath of commercialisation"" and ""deadlock of efficient brands.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The writer's opinions and ideas are not well-organized, and the transitions between sentences are often abrupt. The use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of incorrect word choice and spelling errors.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer starts by stating their agreement with the statement, but the reasons provided are not well-supported and lack specific examples. The first point about the importance of cars for people to go to work or travel is vague and does not provide any concrete evidence. The second point about the pollution in cities and the need for safer streets is a good idea, but it is not clearly connected to the original statement.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. Many sentences are short and lack variety, and there are several instances of subject-verb agreement errors. The use of phrases such as ""I think that"" and ""for me"" is overused and makes the writing seem informal.

However, the writer does attempt to provide some original ideas, such as the importance of using technology to create a better world. This shows that they are thinking critically about the topic and are trying to provide a unique perspective.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. They have provided several specific examples to support their answer, including advertisements for fast food, whitening cream, detergents, and clothes. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to illustrate the student's point.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The essay jumps abruptly from one example to another, and some of the transitions between paragraphs are unclear. For instance, the student starts by discussing the impact of advertising on people, but then suddenly shifts to discussing different types of exaggeration in advertisements.

Additionally, the student's writing could be more precise and accurate. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""We all know that advertising have a high impact on people"" should be ""We all know that advertising has a high impact on people."" Similarly, ""they shows a big burger"" should be ""they show a big burger.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the topic. While they provide some good examples, they do not fully explore the implications of their argument. For instance, they mention that some companies do not advertise their products, but they do not explain why this is the case or what it says about the effectiveness of advertising.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective. They summarize their main points, but they do not provide a clear final thought or call to action.

A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's stance on the prompt and provided a roadmap for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another without clear connections, making it difficult to follow. For example, the student starts by mentioning a manager needing to know advertising and accounting, but then shifts to discussing the benefits of having broad knowledge without explaining how these two ideas are related.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is often unclear or irrelevant. The example of the math teacher taking painting courses is not directly related to the prompt, and the connection to having broad knowledge is tenuous at best. Similarly, the example of the student needing to know interest rates to get a job as a cashier is not a strong argument for the benefits of broad knowledge.

Fourthly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing. For example, ""It is always usefull for example"" should be ""It is always useful for example,"" and ""I have no cahnce"" should be ""I have no chance.""

Finally, the student's conclusion is weak and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

The student also acknowledges the importance of motivation and the influence of parents in encouraging young people to help their communities. 

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student seems to be wavering between agreeing and disagreeing with the statement, which makes the essay feel disjointed.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively agreeing with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides specific reasons and examples to support the argument, showcasing the student's ability to think critically and provide concrete evidence.

Strengths:

1.  The student has effectively used personal experience as a president of Key Club to illustrate the decline in community service among youths, making the argument more relatable and authentic.
2.  The essay highlights the economic and social reasons behind the lack of community service, such as the expectation of tangible rewards and the influence of capitalism.
3.  The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the issue and has provided a well-structured argument, using transitional phrases to connect ideas.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the economic and social reasons behind the decline in community service. Some points, such as the influence of capitalism, feel somewhat superficial.
2.  The student could have provided more concrete examples or statistics to support the claim that the majority of youths are motivated by the need to ""look good"" on college transcripts.
3.  Some sentences, such as ""It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their times for others,"" feel somewhat clichéd and could be rephrased for more impact.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt and providing some relevant points to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has attempted to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the situation of older people in Asian countries who have to work hard to support their families. This shows that the student has understood the importance of using concrete examples to support their claims.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Apparently, young people have much more time to enjoy themselves"" (subject-verb agreement error), ""There is a problem somewhat too colplicated to speak easy way"" (spelling error), and ""They have great royalty to their family"" ( incorrect word choice). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""in my experience"" and ""in fact"" being overused. Additionally, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, with abrupt changes in topic and ideas.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not fully developed, with some points being unclear or unsupported. For example, the statement ""more time does not mean more joyful"" is not fully explained, and the student does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.

Overall, while the student has shown some potential, their writing needs significant improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three main points to support their agreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The essay jumps abruptly into the first point without a clear introduction or a well-defined argument. The student should have started with a clear statement of their stance on the prompt and then supported it with evidence.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow. For example, the transition from the first to the second point is abrupt, and the third point seems disconnected from the previous two. The student should have used transitional phrases such as ""however,"" ""in addition,"" or ""meanwhile"" to connect their ideas.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat vague and lacks specificity. For instance, the example of the vice president taking risks to become the president is not clearly explained, and the example of opening one's own store is also not well-developed. The student should have provided more detailed and concrete examples to support their arguments.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points. The student should have rephrased the main points in their own words and provided a final thought or call to action.

Evaluation: 

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides a personal example from their major in international trade, which is relevant to the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a concrete example from a Turkish company, which effectively illustrates the benefits of taking risks. The student's description of the company's transformation from producing shoes to onions is engaging and provides a clear understanding of the concept. Additionally, the student's use of specific numbers, such as the company's annual earnings of 1 billion dollars, adds credibility to their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I am talking abaout money"" and ""Its a biggest turkish company."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""earn big moneys"" and ""more usefull for consumers"" being used instead of more formal alternatives.

Another area for improvement is the student's ability to provide a balanced argument. While they acknowledge that taking risks can be beneficial, they also state that ""you need a little bit good luck in your business life,"" which suggests that success is not solely dependent on taking risks. This nuance is not fully explored, and the student could have provided more evidence to support this claim.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt, with a sudden shift from discussing the benefits of taking risks to stating that it's not good for everyone. A more cohesive conclusion that ties together the main points would have been more effective.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used specific examples to support their argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes, particularly the story about the writer's grandfather. This adds a relatable and engaging element to the essay, making it more interesting to read. The writer also uses vivid metaphors, such as the ""cycle of life"" and the ""flower reaching its most beautiful point,"" which effectively convey their ideas.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with errors in verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, in the first sentence, ""Young people definitely contain the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit"" should be ""Young people have the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better clarity.

Another area for improvement is the organization of the essay. While the writer has provided specific examples to support their argument, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of young people to sharing a personal anecdote about their grandfather. A clearer connection between the ideas would make the essay flow better.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and balanced arguments. While they acknowledge that older people may find joy in different tasks, they do not fully consider the possibility that older people may have a deeper appreciation for life due to their life experiences. A more balanced approach would strengthen the writer's argument and make it more convincing.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement, but their writing is marred by several grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and unclear sentence structures. 

One of the major issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, such as ""knowlenge"" instead of ""knowledge,"" ""experienres"" instead of ""experiences,"" and ""diccution"" instead of ""discussion."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

In terms of content, the student has attempted to provide reasons for why they agree with the statement. However, their arguments are not well-supported and lack specific examples. For instance, when discussing the benefits of having broad knowledge, the student mentions that it allows for discussions with different types of people, but fails to provide a clear example of how this would be beneficial in a real-world scenario.

The student also attempts to provide examples, such as the conversation about Organic Chemistry, but the example is unclear and lacks context. Furthermore, the student's writing often jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

The student's writing also lacks depth and analysis. They simply state that having broad knowledge is beneficial without providing any evidence or supporting details to back up their claims. For example, when discussing the importance of knowing how to use a computer, the student fails to explain why this is a valuable skill or how it relates to the original statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that specializing in one specific subject has more advantages than having broad knowledge of many subjects. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides specific examples from their home country to support their argument, such as the example of computer firms hiring people from countries like India due to the lack of experts in their own country.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""my oppinion"" instead of ""my opinion,"" ""computerfirms"" instead of ""computer firms,"" and ""it shoulb"" instead of ""it should."" These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Additionally, the student could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of their ideas. For example, when discussing the advantages of specialization, they mention that it is beneficial for a country's economy, but they do not elaborate on what specific benefits this brings. Similarly, when discussing the importance of teamwork in larger companies, they could provide more concrete examples of how this helps to solve problems.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some thoughtful insights.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides three main reasons to support this claim: the purpose of advertisements to convince consumers, the desire for increased profit, and the need to dominate the market. 

Strengths of the essay include:

1. The student has attempted to provide specific reasons to support their claim, which is a crucial aspect of essay writing.
2. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, three main points, and a conclusion.
3. The student has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""First to think about advertisements,"" ""Secondly,"" and ""Finally.""

However, there are areas for improvement:

1. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the sentence ""In order to convince a consumer for a product, one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is best at all"" could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.
2. The student has not provided concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, they mention that advertisements are designed to increase profit, but do not provide a specific example of a company that has done this.

Although the student touches on the idea of young people not giving enough time to helping their communities, this is not the primary focus of the essay.

Strengths:

1. The student has made an effort to provide specific examples and reasons to support their answer, such as the impact of industrialization, the busy schedules of children, and the influence of television.
2. The student has attempted to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, such as ""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"" and ""Finally.""

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence in its structure and organization. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific examples of how young people can contribute to their communities, such as paying for charity, teaching, babysitting, and participating in community activities like cleaning. These ideas demonstrate an understanding of the importance of community involvement.

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and poor sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""Every person in the community has to work for acheiving the community's golas"" should be ""Every person in the community has to work towards achieving the community's goals."" Similarly, the phrase ""every thinkinful person"" should be ""every thoughtful person.""

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. They simply state that young people should help their communities without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. The essay also lacks a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to understand the writer's main argument.

To improve, the student should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement, organizing their ideas logically, and providing more evidence to support their claims. They should also work on refining their grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.

Strengths:

1. The student attempts to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the scenario of a sports student attending business classes to gain broader skills.
2. They reference a relevant quote from Darwin's ""The survival of the fittest"" to link to the assignment.
3. The student shows awareness of the importance of continuous learning and the value of broadening one's knowledge.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear and concise introduction that sets up the argument and provides a thesis statement. The opening sentence is vague and does not engage the reader.
2. The writing is often informal, with errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling (e.g., ""At first glance it seems to be a baffling question,"" ""esssay,"" ""indulge in new surroundings,"" ""focussed,"" ""assigment,"" ""introdcution"").

The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do,"" with the writer presenting several reasons to support their argument. The writer's use of specific examples and explanations is commendable, making the essay engaging and easy to follow.

One of the strengths of the essay is the effective use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs. For instance, the writer uses phrases like ""Main factor in favor of young people is their high energy levels"" and ""While it is true that young people do not have enough time in their schedules as compared to older people"" to smoothly transition between ideas. This demonstrates a good understanding of essay structure and organization.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations for some of the points made. For example, when discussing the idea that young people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activities, the writer could have provided more specific examples or statistics to support this claim. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""Young people have multiple outlets to enjoy life - at work, home or socializing,"" could be more specific and detailed to make the argument more convincing.

Furthermore, the writer could have addressed potential counterarguments more effectively. While the writer acknowledges that older people may have more time and financial resources, they could have provided a more detailed response to this point, such as discussing how young people's energy and risk-taking abilities can lead to new experiences and opportunities that older people may not have.

In terms of language use, the writer demonstrates a good command of basic grammar and vocabulary, but there are some areas where the language could be more precise and varied. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""enjoy life to the fullest"" multiple times, which becomes repetitive and could be rephrased for more variety.

They provide some valid reasons for their opinion, including the desire for independence, flexibility, and the ability to fully immerse themselves in the local culture. However, their writing is marred by several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the major issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and incorrect use of articles. For example, ""As the economy and travelling ablities growing rapidly"" should be ""As the economy and traveling abilities are growing rapidly."" Additionally, ""I wil definitely choose travel alone to taste my tour"" should be ""I will definitely choose to travel alone to taste my tour."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic phrases and clichés, such as ""the extoic culture"" and ""the fantastic amusement of the tour."" While they attempt to provide examples to support their argument, their reasoning is not always logical or well-developed. For instance, they claim that traveling alone allows them to ""touch the soul of the other forms of humanbeing's culture,"" but this statement is unclear and lacks concrete evidence.

The student also struggles with coherence and organization, as their paragraphs often seem disconnected and lack a clear flow. They jump abruptly from discussing the advantages of traveling alone to mentioning their personal preference for traveling with their lover. This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to follow their argument and understand their perspective.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates some ability to analyze the topic and provide a clear stance.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples, such as the development of telecommunications and fibre optics, to illustrate the importance of in-depth study in a specific subject. This demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the ability to think critically. Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""indepth understanding,"" ""critical for research and innovations,"" and ""contribute meaningfully and effectively"" shows a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps straight into their argument without providing a clear thesis statement or context. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""It is easy to dabble in many subjects.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in the introduction. The sentence ""First of all, I strongly disagree the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do. I am thinking that older people could enjoy their life"" is unclear and does not effectively introduce the main argument. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the thesis statement and provided a roadmap for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is limited, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. For example, the sentence ""On the other hand, older people could enjoy their life"" abruptly shifts the focus from young people to older people without a clear connection between the two ideas. The student could have used transitional phrases such as ""However,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore"" to link the ideas more smoothly.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For instance, the sentence ""They could enjoy life to spend time with friends but this is not enjoying"" contains a grammatical error, and the phrase ""of caurse"" should be spelled as ""of course."" The student should strive to use more precise vocabulary and grammar to convey their ideas effectively.

Lastly, the student's use of examples and supporting evidence is limited.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but the arguments are not well-organized, and the language is often unclear and riddled with grammatical errors.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and logical flow. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, the first paragraph starts by stating that old people enjoyed their lives in the past, but then shifts to the idea that they can't do what young people do now. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying on vague statements and generalizations.

Another issue is the misuse of vocabulary and grammar. The writer uses words like ""sugestion"" instead of ""suggestion,"" ""boriying"" instead of ""boring,"" and ""wity"" instead of ""with."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

Despite these issues, the writer attempts to provide some valid points, such as the idea that young people are more brave and have more opportunities to enjoy life. However, these points are not fully developed, and the writer fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The writer has provided some specific reasons and examples to support their answer, but there are also some areas where the writing could be more effective.

Strengths:

- The writer has taken a clear stance on the issue and provided some relevant examples to support their argument.
- The writer has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""However,"" and ""Finally.""
- The writer has shown some awareness of the importance of community service and environmental protection.

Weaknesses:

- The writer's thesis statement is not clear and concise. The first sentence ""Comparing to previous generations, many of today's young people have forgotten the importance of their community"" is a good starting point, but it could be more specific and focused.
- The writer has used some grammatical errors, such as ""Comparing to"" instead of ""Compared to,"" ""fascinating to people"" instead of ""fascinating for people,"" and ""drinkging"" instead of ""drinking.""
- The writer has also used some awkward phrasing, such as ""Unlike today's people, our previous generations learn to treasure their communities because they felt responsible to their own environment; it is something they were told when they were young."" This sentence could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.
- The writer has not fully developed their ideas and examples. For instance, the example of community service in schools is mentioned, but it is not fully explained or supported with evidence.
- The writer has also used some clichéd phrases, such as ""Our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people."" This phrase is not original and does not add much to the argument.

Suggestions for improvement:

- Revise the thesis statement to make it more specific and focused.
- Edit the essay for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.
- Develop the ideas and examples more fully, providing more evidence and supporting details.
- Avoid using clichéd phrases and try to come up with more original ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention young people volunteering for various causes, such as helping disabled people, immigrants, and those affected by natural disasters. These examples are relevant and help to illustrate their point.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the negative aspects of modern society to highlighting the positive actions of young people. A more logical connection between these ideas would strengthen the essay.

Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, the sentence ""The post a person occupies, the salary he or she recieves, the commodities of his or her house, the car, the clothes, and other material things that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethics of a person and his or her behaviour towards other human beings and the place he or she inhabits"" is a long and convoluted sentence that is difficult to follow. Breaking it up into simpler sentences would improve clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. While they mention the negative effects of individualism, they could delve deeper into the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly related to the thesis statement. The writer states that ""everybody should follow their example,"" but this statement feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and supporting it with personal experiences and observations. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, ""i think this is a general statement, and it is too difficul discussing about this without following in born tinks"" should be ""I think this is a general statement, and it is too difficult to discuss without following my thoughts."" Similarly, ""my father tolk to me about the second world war"" should be ""my father told me about the second world war."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-organized, and the transitions between ideas are often abrupt. For example, the student jumps from discussing the difficulties faced by young people to talking about their father's experiences during the second world war without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. Additionally, the student's use of examples is not always relevant to the topic at hand. For instance, the discussion about the wedding and divorce rates seems unrelated to the main argument.

Despite these issues, the student does attempt to provide some supporting evidence for their stance, such as the example of their father enjoying his life despite the difficulties he faced. However, this example is not fully developed, and the student could have provided more analysis and explanation to make it more convincing.

- The student has demonstrated an attempt to consider multiple perspectives, including the potential drawbacks of both options.

Weaknesses:

- Grammar and vocabulary errors are prevalent throughout the essay, which can make it difficult to understand at times. For example, ""Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make the students know a little of every subject but it won't get focused on a specific subject"" should be rephrased to ""Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make students familiar with a little of every subject, but it may not allow them to focus on a specific subject.""
- The student often uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which can make the essay seem less engaging and less polished.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the best way to travel. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use vocabulary and phrases that demonstrate their understanding of the topic. For instance, they use the word ""adventurous"" to describe traveling alone or with friends, and ""obstacles"" to describe the challenges one may face during life. These words show that the student is familiar with the topic and has attempted to use relevant vocabulary.

However, the essay is marred by numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For example, ""No one would be able to stay in a specific country fopr the rest of his life"" should be ""No one would be able to stay in a specific country for the rest of his life."" Similarly, ""Lets assume that theres some1 donst want to travel and leave his country"" should be ""Let's assume that there's someone who doesn't want to travel and leave his country.""

The student also struggles to provide clear and concise examples to support their argument. While they mention that traveling alone would provide a person with a chance to stand up and take responsibility of himself, they fail to elaborate on this point or provide specific examples to illustrate their claim.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance in their analysis. They make sweeping statements, such as ""Life is not all about joy and pleasure it is mainly to experience the rough times a person would go through,"" without providing any supporting evidence or explanation.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. However, their essay is marred by several issues that detract from its overall effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""develope"" instead of ""development,"" ""techknowleges"" instead of ""technologies,"" and ""konwledge"" instead of ""knowledge."" These errors make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning and detract from the overall clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning or evidence. While they mention that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people feel more confident and allow them to communicate with others, they do not provide any concrete examples or explanations to back up these claims. For instance, when discussing the benefits of studying geometry and data courses, the student fails to provide specific examples of how these subjects can be applied in real-life situations.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to talking about the importance of confidence and communication skills. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the student fails to provide a clear thesis statement that ties the entire essay together.

However, the student does attempt to provide some examples to support their argument, such as the scenario of a student at a party who can communicate with others due to their broad knowledge. This shows that the student is trying to engage with the prompt and provide some evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, while the student has made an effort to address the prompt, their essay is hindered by grammatical errors, a lack of logical reasoning, and poor organization. With some revision and attention to these areas, the student could produce a stronger essay.

One of the main issues is the presence of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which can make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning. For instance, ""ambuoules"" should be ""ambiguous,"" ""espacially"" should be ""especially,"" ""pepole"" should be ""people,"" and ""neither"" should be used correctly in the sentence. These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In terms of content, the writer attempts to provide reasons for why young people do not help their communities, but the examples are not well-supported and often seem to be based on personal opinions rather than evidence. For example, the writer states that young people are ""egoistic"" and ""always looking for a payment,"" but these claims are not backed up with concrete examples or data.

The writer also struggles to organize their ideas coherently, jumping between different points without clear transitions or connections. For instance, the sentence ""Many of the work which is to do in a german communities is made by so called young people who finished school"" seems to come out of nowhere and is not clearly linked to the previous or following sentences.

However, the writer does attempt to provide some specific examples, such as the idea that young people are busy with their education and own future, and that younger children may not have the confidence or responsibility to work for the community.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The introduction is vague and does not provide a clear thesis statement. The student states that ""The life is very beautiful if you know the way that you can enjoy for it,"" but this sentence does not directly relate to the topic of the essay. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's opinion on the statement and provided a brief explanation of the reasons that support it.

Secondly, the student's use of grammar and vocabulary is limited, which affects the overall flow and readability of the essay. For example, the sentence ""The young people are healthy than the older people"" should be ""Young people are healthier than older people."" Additionally, the student uses simple sentences that lack variety, making the essay seem monotonous.

Thirdly, the student's examples are not well-supported and lack specific details. The example of playing football with friends is a good start, but it could be developed further to provide more insight into how this activity contributes to young people enjoying life more. The comparison between the student's behavior and their father's behavior is also not well-explained, and the student's conclusion that ""everyone are younger will enjoy the life more than older people"" is grammatically incorrect.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. The student simply states that young people are healthier, have more time, and like to go out, but does not provide any evidence or explanation to support these claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the importance of trying new things and taking risks. They have provided a good example of the shoe-making industry, highlighting the need to adapt to new materials and techniques to remain competitive. Additionally, the student has effectively used the concept of synergy to explain how combining new and existing knowledge can lead to innovation.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. While they provide some good examples, they often rely on general statements and clichés, such as ""the world is divided into 'things' artificially by the humans"" and ""the process of exploration required long periods of hard work."" More specific and concrete examples would help to strengthen the student's arguments.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer presents three main reasons to support their argument: young people's irresponsibility, the competitive world, and their lack of concern for others. 

Strengths of the essay include:

1.  The writer attempts to provide specific examples to support their claims, such as the comparison between the 1900s and the present day, the example of young people's addiction to drugs and crime, and the survey on people's reactions to perverts in a crowded subway.
2.  The writer tries to address the complexity of the issue by mentioning the impact of the competitive world on young people's behavior and the consequences of their actions on society.
3.  The writer shows some awareness of the importance of community service and the need for young people to contribute to their societies.

However, there are also several areas that need improvement:

1.  The writer's language and grammar are often inaccurate, which makes it difficult to understand their intended meaning. For example, ""The world is changed, also people are changed"" should be ""The world has changed, and people have changed."" ""We can't say, not at all"" is unclear and should be rephrased. ""Coup de ta't"" is a typo and should be ""coup d'état.""
2.  The writer's ideas are not well-organized, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For example, the second paragraph starts with ""Secondly,"" but it is not clear what the first reason was. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the competitive world to the lack of concern for others.
3.  The writer's examples are not always relevant or convincing. For example, the comparison between the 1900s and the present day is not well-supported, and the survey on people's reactions to perverts in a crowded subway is not directly related to the topic of young people's lack of community involvement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that the number of cars in use will continue to increase in the future. The essay provides several reasons to support this claim, including the growing population, decreasing car prices, changing family dynamics, and the emergence of eco-friendly cars. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student has attempted to address the counterargument of pollution, suggesting that eco-friendly cars can help mitigate this issue.
- The essay provides some relevant examples, such as the increasing affordability of cars and the shift towards two-seater sedans.
- The student has demonstrated an understanding of the topic and has made an effort to provide supporting reasons.

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The essay lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow at times.
- The student has not fully addressed the statement, as they agree that the number of cars will continue to rise, but also acknowledge that this will lead to increased traffic problems.
- There are several grammatical errors, such as ""thouh"" instead of ""though,"" ""futhermore"" instead of ""furthermore,"" and missing articles.
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly or lack clarity, such as ""The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, effectively agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know. The essay provides several examples from history, such as the Wright Brothers and Graham Bell, to support this claim. The student also references the importance of creativity and thinking differently, citing the potential of the human mind to think in various ways.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as some ideas seem disconnected. Additionally, there are instances of grammatical errors, such as ""easlily"" instead of ""easily"" and ""become"" instead of ""become to be."" Furthermore, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

The student's use of examples and references to historical figures is commendable, but could be more effectively integrated into the essay. For instance, the Einstein example feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay. The student also relies heavily on clichés, such as ""the fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty,"" which could be replaced with more original phrasing.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some relevant supporting evidence. However, the writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, sentence structure, and cohesion.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides various examples to support their argument, including the historical context of the Earth's shape, technological advancements, and personal anecdotes.

Strengths:

1.  The student uses relevant examples to illustrate their points, such as the discovery of the Earth's shape and the importance of adapting to technological changes.
2.  They demonstrate an understanding of the concept of risk-taking and its relation to success, acknowledging that some risks may lead to failure but are necessary for growth.
3.  The student shows awareness of the importance of being reasonable and cautious when taking risks, as exemplified by the wealthy businessman who invests in shares.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from more precise and varied vocabulary, with some sentences containing repetitive or simplistic language (e.g., ""new ways and ideas are always essential for the success of a person"").
2.  There are some grammatical errors, such as ""Techonological"" instead of ""Technological"" and ""compettitive"" instead of ""competitive.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Their argument is well-supported by specific examples from real-life scenarios, such as the success of specialization in factories and manufacturing plants, and their personal experience as a research scientist. The student effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, making the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""becuase"" instead of ""because,"" ""hieghts"" instead of ""heights,"" and ""somethings"" instead of ""things."" Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""After all, if some one wishes to be a mechanical engineer, why does he need to know the literary feature that Shakespeare had used to capture his audiences attention."" The student could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the overall clarity and coherence of their writing.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples could be more nuanced. While their personal experience as a research scientist is relevant, it is not entirely convincing, as they mention that studying Spanish and Business ""seem to divert time away from my goals"" and that they ""sincerely doubt the importance of spanish in the long run."" This comes across as somewhat self-serving and may not be a compelling argument for others. A more objective example would strengthen their argument.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective. They state that ""to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything,"" but this is a somewhat simplistic conclusion that does not fully address the complexities of the topic.

Evaluation: 

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, providing both a counterargument and supporting examples to justify their position. The essay structure is coherent, and the writer has attempted to address the prompt's requirements by using reasons and examples to support their answer. However, there are areas that need improvement to elevate the writing quality.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples from real-life companies like Bouygues and Virgin to illustrate the idea that successful people take risks. The writer has also provided a good counterexample with Alain Baraton, a gardener who failed in school but still pursued his passion for gardening. These examples demonstrate the writer's ability to think critically and provide concrete evidence to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and vocabulary are not sophisticated enough for a high-scoring essay. Phrases such as ""I do not believe that the given statement is true"" and ""I understand the logic which lies under that assumption"" are too simplistic and could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar. Additionally, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations for their examples, rather than relying on general statements.

Furthermore, the writer's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the success of companies to introducing Alain Baraton as a counterexample. A smoother transition between ideas would make the essay flow better and be more engaging to read.

Lastly, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the writer's stance. The current conclusion feels a bit abrupt and does not provide a clear final thought.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, providing three main reasons to support their agreement. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

Firstly, the student's writing is generally clear, but there are instances of grammatical errors, such as ""No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the adversitiment"" (should be ""advertising"") and ""the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages"" (should be ""the advertisements will only show the advantages""). Additionally, the student uses simple sentence structures, which can make the writing seem a bit flat.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""the customs"" (should be ""customers"") and ""the advertiser can sale it"" (should be ""the advertiser can sell it""). Furthermore, the student could have used more precise language to describe the effects of advertisements, such as ""misleading"" or ""deceptive"" instead of ""extra-damaged.""

Thirdly, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the ideas could be more clearly connected. For instance, the third paragraph seems to be a repetition of the first two points, and the conclusion could be more effectively linked to the previous arguments.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided some relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from advertisements to support their argument. For instance, the comparison between Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola is a good example of how advertisers use techniques to make their product seem better than the competition. Additionally, the student has attempted to address the potential counterargument that advertisers might use other techniques to sell their products, such as reverse psychology.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect use of articles, and incorrect verb tenses. For example, ""Over the last century, advertising has become one of the most developped and i;portant activity in humankind"" should be ""Over the last century, advertising has become one of the most developed and important activities in human history."" Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with words such as ""i;portant"" and ""tha"" being used instead of ""important"" and ""that"".

Furthermore, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the role of advertisers to discussing the use of reverse psychology in advertising. A clearer transition between paragraphs would help to improve the flow of the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not provide a clear summary of the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought on the topic.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of language. The writer's ideas are not well-organized, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The writer starts by stating their agreement with the statement, but the reasons provided are not well-supported and lack specific examples. The writer mentions that young people have many relationships with others, but fails to provide concrete evidence to back this claim. 

The writer also makes a generalization that older people do not go to school or have jobs, which is not necessarily true. This statement is also not supported by any evidence. Furthermore, the writer's comparison of young and old people's lifestyles is not balanced, as they only focus on the limitations of older people without acknowledging the potential challenges faced by young people.

The writer's use of examples, such as their grandfather's situation, is not effective in supporting their argument. The writer's interpretation of their grandfather's happiness is subjective and not a reliable indicator of the happiness of all older people. 

The writer's conclusion is also weak, as they simply reiterate their initial statement without providing any new insights or evidence to support their argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas and examples without a clear logical flow.

One of the main issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which hinder the reader's understanding of the writer's intended message. For instance, the writer uses ""oppurtunity"" instead of ""opportunity,"" ""untill"" instead of ""until,"" and ""trevel"" instead of ""travel."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, but these are often vague and lack concrete evidence. For example, the writer mentions that young people nowadays have more opportunities and travel to university, which takes up more time. However, they fail to provide concrete statistics or data to support this claim.

On the other hand, the writer does provide some personal anecdotes and experiences, such as their own experiences helping their community. These examples are more engaging and provide a glimpse into the writer's perspective. However, the writer could have expanded on these experiences and provided more details to make their argument more convincing.

The writer's opinion on the statement is also somewhat unclear. They initially agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, but then contradict themselves by stating that they have helped their community a lot of times. This inconsistency makes it difficult to understand the writer's stance on the issue.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides two specific examples to support this claim: the advertisement for a new skateboard and Kraft's dinner products. The student has also attempted to explain the reasons behind this phenomenon, including the use of surveys, attractive packaging, and the use of models in advertisements.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided concrete examples to support their claim, making the essay more engaging and convincing.
2. They have attempted to analyze the content of advertisements, highlighting the use of surveys and attractive packaging as tactics to make products seem more appealing.
3. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the target audience and how advertisements are designed to appeal to them.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some personal experiences and examples to support the argument, which is a good starting point for a second language learner. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and logical flow. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For instance, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph is unclear, and the connection between the two ideas is not well-established. To improve this, the student should use transitional phrases and sentences to link ideas together.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary and grammar are limited, which affects the clarity and effectiveness of the writing. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""I love a model of the fashion magagine"" (should be ""fashion magazine""), ""people is easily made to want"" (should be ""people are easily made to want""), and ""magagines"" (should be ""magazines""). The student should focus on using more precise and accurate vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While they provide some examples, such as the experience of buying a cloth and the use of famous people in advertisements, they do not provide sufficient analysis or explanation to support their argument. To strengthen their argument, the student should provide more detailed and nuanced examples that demonstrate the ways in which advertisements can be misleading.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. To improve this, the student should reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, providing some relevant reasons and examples to support the writer's opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples, such as the comparison between well-educated and less-educated individuals, and the impact of daily events like war on young people's attitudes towards their communities. These examples help to support the writer's argument and make the essay more engaging.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the impact of education to the influence of daily events without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. 

Additionally, the writer's sentence structure and grammar are not always clear, which can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For example, the sentence ""The community associations are formed in order to serve  their community,to make it develop"" is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased for clarity.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of word repetition, such as the use of ""young people"" multiple times. This can make the writing feel repetitive and less engaging.

Finally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not provide a clear summary of the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the writer's main argument and provide a final thought or call to action.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They have also shown a good attempt to think critically about the topic and consider different perspectives. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal anecdotes to illustrate their points. The example about the haircut and the confidence boost it gave them is a good way to show how young people can enjoy life. The student also does a good job of acknowledging that people's preferences for fun activities can change over time, as seen in their own transformation from disliking solo activities to enjoying them.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets out the student's main argument. While the student does eventually conclude that it's impossible to compare one person's idea of fun to another's, this is not explicitly stated in the introduction. Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar. For example, ""I remember, for a while in my life, anytime I would walk into someplace with a slick and snazzy new haircut, I would believe people looked up to me, and it would be for the rest of the night that I'd enjoy myself, due to my newly installed confidence"" could be rephrased to make it easier to understand.

Furthermore, the student could provide more evidence to support their argument. While they mention that their parents enjoy playing Bezik and going on boat trips, they don't explain why they find these activities enjoyable. Adding more details about the activities and why they are enjoyable would make the essay more convincing.

Finally, the student could benefit from using more formal language and avoiding colloquial expressions such as ""pysched"" and ""snazzy"". This would make the essay sound more polished and professional.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the effectiveness of advertising. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure, making it challenging to follow the student's argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating their opinion but does not explicitly state the main argument they will be presenting. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the direction of the essay.

The student provides some examples to support their argument, such as the coffee shop scenario and the popularity of cola and pepsi. However, these examples are not well-developed and lack specific details. The student also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""looks matters a lot"" and ""advertisement increases the worth of the product."" These statements are not supported by concrete evidence and make the essay seem superficial.

The student's writing also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""interesting discussion topic for the people"" and ""picturization."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The student attempts to conclude the essay by stating that advertising enhances the worth and beauty of products, but this conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to routine tasks. The essay is well-structured, with three main points supporting the argument: the importance of innovation in the business environment, the demand for new products and services in today's world, and the connection between taking risks and life satisfaction.

Strengths:

1.  The student provides specific examples to support their argument, such as the experience with the internship and the story of Bill Gates. These examples help to illustrate the points being made and make the essay more engaging.
2.  The student uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""Firstly,"" ""The second important point is,"" and ""To sum up."" This helps to create a clear flow of ideas and makes the essay easier to follow.
3.  The student attempts to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""innovation,"" ""corporations,"" and ""society."" This shows an effort to use more complex language and vocabulary.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student struggles with grammar and spelling errors, such as ""generally succesful,"" ""in these days,"" ""the most of the corporations,"" and ""soceity."" These errors can make the essay difficult to read and understand.
2.  The student's writing style is sometimes simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of varied sentence structure. This can make the essay feel a bit flat and unengaging.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. They have provided two main reasons to support their answer: safety and convenience. 

In the first point, the student effectively highlights the potential dangers of traveling alone in foreign countries, using a specific example of Koreans being scammed during an East Asia trip. They also explain how a tour guide can mitigate these risks due to their knowledge of the local conditions and situations. However, the student could have provided more nuanced language to express their ideas, such as using transitional phrases to connect their ideas and varying sentence structures to maintain reader interest.

In the second point, the student emphasizes the convenience of group touring, mentioning that tour companies make plans and reservations in advance, reducing the risk of hotel room shortages and allowing travelers to focus on enjoying their trip. They also highlight the guide's knowledge of the country, which enables them to show travelers the most famous and beautiful places. While the student's points are clear, they could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as describing a particular experience or anecdote.

The student's writing is generally clear and easy to understand, with some minor errors in grammar and vocabulary. For instance, they use ""aborad"" instead of ""abroad,"" ""reaosn"" instead of ""reasons,"" and ""convinient"" instead of ""convenient.""

Evaluation:

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer expressing disagreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay's organization and coherence could be improved. The writer jumps between ideas and sometimes uses vague language, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's attempt to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They discuss how young people are often raised by their parents to prioritize their own needs and desires, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their communities' requirements. This is a valid point, and the writer provides some concrete examples to illustrate their argument.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer's language is often simplistic, with many grammatical errors and typos. For example, ""one or two thing"" should be ""one or two things,"" and ""so stupidly and so lazy"" is an overly judgmental phrase. Additionally, the writer's use of transitions between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Furthermore, the writer's argument could be more nuanced. While they acknowledge that young people are not entirely to blame for their lack of community involvement, they place most of the responsibility on their parents and the country's management. This oversimplifies the issue and neglects the role of individual agency and personal choices.

To improve the essay, the writer could focus on providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their argument. They could also work on refining their language and organization to make their ideas more clear and coherent.

The essay provides some relevant reasons and examples to support this stance, showcasing the student's ability to think critically and make connections between ideas.

Strengths:

1. The student has taken a clear position on the topic and provided some relevant examples from their personal experience to support their argument. This demonstrates their ability to think critically and apply their knowledge to real-life situations.
2. The student has attempted to explain the importance of understanding ideas and concepts in relation to the development of new concepts and the advancement of science and engineering. This shows an understanding of the broader implications of the topic.
3. The student has also touched on the idea that learning facts can be challenging when trying to find relationships between them, and that understanding ideas and concepts can help facilitate this process.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks clarity and coherence in some areas, with sentences that are grammatically incorrect or awkwardly phrased. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought at times.
2. The student could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their arguments, rather than relying on general statements.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided a clear stance on the statement. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the writer's arguments. For instance, the writer mentions that young people have the energy to engage in activities like traveling, riding a bike, and running, which is a good point. Additionally, the writer highlights the pressure of the 21st century, such as the need for a successful job and a diploma, which is a valid concern.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language is often informal and contains grammatical errors. For example, ""lots of poeple thinks"" should be ""many people think,"" and ""eihter"" should be ""either."" The writer also uses colloquial expressions like ""for exeple"" and ""of course,"" which are not suitable for formal writing.

Furthermore, the writer's arguments are not always well-supported. For instance, the statement ""things most older people dont have much energy to do"" is not necessarily true, and the writer provides no evidence to back this claim. Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points.

Finally, the writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""TO ENJOY OR NOT TO ENJOY?"" is a good attempt to engage the reader, but it feels somewhat forced and does not add much to the overall argument.

The student has made a sincere effort to express their opinion on the given topic, and their writing demonstrates a basic understanding of the subject matter. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""thoes,"" ""paly,"" ""inaddition,"" ""in order to hand in in,"" and ""knowlogies."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. It is essential for the student to proofread their work carefully to eliminate such mistakes.

Secondly, the student's argument could be more convincing if they provided more concrete examples and supporting evidence. While they mention the importance of understanding ideas and concepts, they fail to provide specific instances that illustrate this point effectively. For instance, the example of people copying others' work without understanding the answers is a good start, but it could be developed further to make it more impactful.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks cohesion and transitions between paragraphs. The ideas seem to be presented in a disjointed manner, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. To improve this, the student should use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas more smoothly.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points more clearly and concisely. The final sentence, ""it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning factors,"" feels somewhat abrupt and could be rephrased for better impact.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is clear in stating their agreement with the statement, but it lacks a strong opening sentence that effectively grabs the reader's attention. A more engaging opening could have set the tone for the rest of the essay. 

The student provides a personal anecdote to support their argument, which is a good attempt to use a real-life example. However, the anecdote is not well-developed, and the connection to the main argument is not explicitly stated. The student could have elaborated more on how this experience led them to believe that understanding concepts is more important than learning facts.

The student also uses a clear and concise structure to present their reasons for agreeing with the statement. They provide a clear contrast between learning facts and understanding concepts, which is a good way to support their argument. However, the language used is sometimes informal, with errors in grammar and spelling, such as ""it had happened to me that I had to learn all the facts for a test and I end up learning them all"" and ""it wipped out of my head."" 

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and variety in their examples to support their argument. The essay relies heavily on a single anecdote and a general statement about the importance of concepts. Adding more specific examples or evidence from other areas of study or real-life situations would strengthen their argument.

Lastly, the conclusion is brief and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion could have re-emphasized the importance of understanding concepts and provided a final thought or call to action.

Their essay structure is coherent, and they have attempted to use examples to illustrate their points. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and punctuation mistakes. For instance, in the sentence ""Since they are still young and changeable, they can learn things from others' ideas and beliefs and find out what kind of ideas they would prefer more in and try to adopt those ideas in their own daily experince,"" the word ""experince"" should be spelled as ""experience."" These errors can make the text difficult to follow and detract from the overall clarity of the argument.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, in the sentence ""When students learn a fact, they can try to use their previosly-learned different ideas and concepts to look at it,"" the word ""previosly-learned"" could be replaced with a more precise term, such as ""previously acquired"" or ""previously learned."" Additionally, the student could benefit from using more nuanced and sophisticated language to convey their ideas.

Thirdly, the student's examples, while well-intentioned, are not always effectively integrated into the essay. For instance, the example of a student examining whether cooperating with others is always better than working alone is not fully developed, and the student could have explored this idea more thoroughly.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought or reflection on the importance of learning ideas and facts.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people,"" with the writer providing specific reasons and examples to support their argument. The writer's use of personal anecdotes and relatable examples helps to make the essay more engaging and accessible. However, there are areas where the writer could improve to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and explain the advantages of being young, such as having fewer dependencies and a desire to learn and gain experience. The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of how these factors contribute to young people's ability to enjoy life more. For instance, the example of the writer's parents being unable to travel due to childcare responsibilities is a relatable and effective illustration of the point.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more organized structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of being young to making a conclusion that seems to contradict the main argument. A more logical flow of ideas and a clearer transition between paragraphs would make the essay easier to follow.

Additionally, the writer could improve their use of vocabulary and grammar. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""No wonder young people enjoy life more than older people"" (should be ""It is no wonder that young people enjoy life more than older people"") and ""In my opinion, in the early ages people can do lots of things easily without worring anything"" (should be ""In my opinion, in the early ages people can do lots of things easily without worrying about anything""). The writer could also benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to express their ideas.

Finally, the writer could improve their conclusion by summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement in a more confident and assertive manner. The current conclusion seems to undermine the writer's argument by stating that older people and young people cannot be compared.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and cohesion, with some sentences being disconnected from the rest of the essay. For instance, the phrase ""Traveling is very exciting, so I wish I could go everywhere"" seems out of place in the conclusion. It would be more effective to rephrase it to reiterate the main point or summarize the reasons provided.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary and grammar are not always accurate. For example, ""Fistly"" should be spelled as ""Firstly,"" and ""togehter"" should be spelled as ""together."" Additionally, the sentence ""I think,when I travel without any tour guide, I can go any place which I would like to go"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and grammar.

Thirdly, the student could benefit from providing more specific examples to support their claims. While they mention that they have a friend who is good at making a schedule, they do not elaborate on how this has positively impacted their travel experience.

Lastly, the student's writing could be more engaging and varied in terms of sentence structure. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language. For example, instead of saying ""I think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide is not so good,"" the student could say ""I strongly disagree with the notion that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel.""

The writer attempts to address potential counterarguments by mentioning that older people can enjoy life with the help of new technologies and government initiatives.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and attempts to provide some supporting evidence. However, the essay would benefit from more specific and concrete examples, as well as more varied and sophisticated language.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, expressing a strong agreement with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of examples to support the argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their own experience, such as the scenario of high school students learning about historical events. This example is well-analyzed, and the student effectively explains how understanding the underlying reasons and purposes of historical events can lead to a deeper appreciation and better retention of the material.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of intelligence and how it relates to learning. They argue that true intelligence involves being able to solve problems independently and think critically, rather than simply memorizing facts. This is a valuable insight, and the student supports their argument with a clear and concise explanation.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, the phrase ""you will be able to remember it for a long time"" is a bit simplistic, and the student could use more descriptive language to convey their ideas. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as the use of ""hystorical"" instead of ""historical"" and ""analize"" instead of ""analyze"".

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and balanced arguments. While they effectively argue that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than memorizing facts, they could also acknowledge potential counterarguments and provide evidence to refute them. This would make their argument more convincing and persuasive.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer arguing that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, including the distractions of peer pressure, new technology, and pop culture, as well as the superficial motivations of some young people who engage in community service.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide a nuanced view of the issue, acknowledging that not all young people are self-centered and that some may be genuinely interested in helping their communities. The writer also raises an important point about the need for a deeper understanding of what constitutes community service, beyond just volunteering or doing small acts of kindness.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. At times, the writer's arguments feel a bit disjointed, and some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and clear in their expression. For example, the sentence ""No matter how much they are told by parents to help their community, it is impractical if there are so many distractions in their lives"" could be rephrased for greater clarity.

The writer also uses some idiomatic expressions and vocabulary, such as ""lead away from exercising their civic responsibility"" and ""pursuing wild, creative ways of doing things,"" which demonstrates a good command of English language. However, there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as the use of the phrase ""regrettably lacking"" instead of ""regrettably, lacking.""

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some thoughtful insights into the issue. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the essay could be even stronger.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, providing both reasons and examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has also attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, which is a good practice for second language learners.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, in the sentence ""Some people says that this kind of traveling does not satisfy every other members in the group,"" the subject-verb agreement is incorrect, and the phrase ""every other members"" is awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the student often uses simplistic sentence structures, which can make the writing seem less engaging and less polished.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. While the survey mentioned in the essay is a good starting point, it is not clear what specific aspects of the survey support the student's claims. Additionally, the examples provided, such as the adult traveling in India, are somewhat vague and could be fleshed out with more specific details.

Finally, the student could work on varying their vocabulary and sentence structure to create more interest and variety in their writing. For example, the phrase ""it is the most efficient method with a guide"" is a bit repetitive and could be rephrased for more impact.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher level of writing quality. 

Strengths:

1.  The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
2.  The writer offers specific examples of young people's efforts to improve their communities, such as rebuilding schools and participating in social groups to help old and poor people.
3.  The essay attempts to use transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs, such as ""Firstly"" and ""Secondly.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the writing.
2.  The writer struggles with sentence structure and grammar, resulting in awkward phrasing and unclear meaning. For example, ""Communities have lots of problems about improvements"" could be rephrased as ""Communities face numerous problems that require improvement.""
3.  The writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support the claims made in the essay. While the examples given are specific, they are not well-developed or detailed enough to convince the reader.
4.  The conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.
5.  The writer uses some colloquial expressions and informal language, such as ""we can see hundreds of social group,"" which detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the thesis statement to clearly articulate the writer's stance on the topic.
2.  Work on sentence structure and grammar to improve clarity and coherence.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a logical flow of ideas. The student effectively uses examples from history, such as the industrialization and the development of airplanes, to support their argument that successful people try new things and take risks. Additionally, the student shares a personal anecdote about their experience as a Brand Manager, which adds a relatable and authentic touch to the essay.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""inerent"" instead of ""inherent,"" ""unpleasent"" instead of ""unpleasant,"" and ""exaple"" instead of ""example."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is sometimes imprecise. For instance, the phrase ""completelly innovative packaging"" should be ""completely innovative packaging."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""reguard"" instead of ""regard,"" which is a common mistake among non-native English speakers.

In terms of content, the student's argument is clear and well-supported, but it could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and detailed explanations. For example, the student mentions that the development of airplanes was the result of ""years of trial and error,"" but does not elaborate on what specific challenges were faced during this process.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly tied to the main argument. The current conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The writer provides two relatable examples from their teaching experience to support their argument, which shows a good attempt to engage the reader.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Korean parents, who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern's education"" (should be ""have shown huge interest in children's education""), ""childern"" (should be ""children""), and ""munber"" (should be ""number""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations to support their arguments. For instance, when discussing the importance of understanding ideas and concepts, they could have elaborated on how this leads to deeper learning and better retention of information. Additionally, the writer could have explored the potential consequences of overemphasizing fact-gathering, such as the development of rote memorization skills rather than critical thinking.

The writer also uses some colloquial expressions, such as ""as a matter of a fact"" (should be ""as a matter of fact""), which may not be suitable for formal writing. Moreover, the sentence structure is sometimes simplistic, with a lack of variety in sentence length and complexity.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than today. They have provided several reasons and examples to support their argument, showcasing a good understanding of the topic.

Strengths:

1.  The student has utilized relevant and up-to-date information about the advancements in technology, such as the development of hybrid cars and the potential of hydrogen as an alternative fuel source. This demonstrates their ability to engage with current issues and provide concrete examples to support their argument.
2.  They have also shown an understanding of the role of governments in promoting public transportation, citing the example of the metro train project in the United Arab Emirates. This highlights their awareness of the efforts being made to reduce dependence on personal vehicles.
3.  The student has effectively addressed potential counterarguments, acknowledging that not everyone may use public transportation and that some individuals require personal transportation for various reasons. This demonstrates their ability to consider multiple perspectives and anticipate potential criticisms.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing could benefit from more cohesion and coherence. The essay jumps between ideas, and some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the text. For example, the transition from discussing the development of hybrid cars to the role of governments in promoting public transportation feels abrupt.
2.  There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For instance, the sentence ""This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available which is also comfortable"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The writer has also attempted to use examples to support their argument, which is commendable. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a clear and concise thesis statement, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer has also provided two relevant examples to support their argument, including the example of Carlo Ancelotti and the factory worker. These examples are well-integrated into the essay and help to illustrate the writer's point.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation. For example, in the sentence ""If someone has the formula for success, whether he/she found it or is given by the environment, he/she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so,"" the writer uses the phrase ""he/she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so,"" which is a bit awkward and unclear.

Additionally, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with several instances of overused words and phrases, such as ""something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again."" The writer could benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the writer's analysis of the topic is not always nuanced, with some points feeling a bit simplistic or overly broad. For example, the writer states that ""the pushing force for many people is often other candidates, who try to reach success by doing something innovative."" While this is a true statement, it could be developed further to provide more insight into the complexities of competition and success.

Finally, the writer's conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay. The writer states that ""success is not always found by doing something new and taking risks, but there are times where the situation requires it,"" which feels like a bit of a non-sequitur after the rest of the essay.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, and the writer provides some relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide a clear thesis statement at the beginning, stating their agreement with the topic. The writer also attempts to provide supporting reasons and examples, such as the historical context of bicycle usage and the potential for future inventions to replace cars. 

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. Firstly, the writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is often simplistic and lacks variety. For instance, the phrase ""yesteryears"" is not a commonly used term, and the writer could have used more precise language to convey their ideas. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as the incorrect use of verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.

Furthermore, the writer's examples and supporting reasons are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence. For example, the statement ""if a flying machine is invented for the benefit of a common man then there will be more flying machines and less number of cars"" is a vague and unsubstantiated claim. The writer could have provided more specific and detailed examples to strengthen their argument.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear summary of the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have restated the thesis statement and provided a final thought on the topic.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement. However, their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument.

The student attempts to provide reasons for their opinion, mentioning that having broad knowledge can be beneficial in finding a job and that a person with diverse skills is preferred by employers. However, they also acknowledge that specialization is necessary for performing a job well. This mixed message dilutes the effectiveness of their argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I think that a person who has a different specializations"" (should be ""specializations""), ""I undestand"" (should be ""understand""), and ""she/he must specialize in his/her own work"" (should be ""specialize in their own work""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given statement, providing some relevant examples and reasons to support their argument. However, there are several areas where the writing could be improved to demonstrate a higher level of proficiency.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use their personal experience as a student to illustrate their point. The example of learning facts by heart for exams and forgetting them quickly is a relatable and effective way to demonstrate the limitations of the current education system. Additionally, the student provides a clear and concise explanation of the benefits of learning concepts and ideas, such as understanding the background and being able to apply strategies in daily situations.

However, there are several areas where the writing could be improved. Firstly, the student's language is often informal and lacks precision. For example, the use of ""I, being a student for 12 years now"" could be rephrased to ""Having spent 12 years as a student"" to make the language more formal. Similarly, the student uses colloquial expressions such as ""in my opinion"" and ""I feel able to juge"" which detract from the overall formality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the limitations of the current education system to the benefits of learning concepts and ideas. A clearer transition between these ideas would make the essay flow more smoothly.

Finally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences and phrases. For example, the phrase ""you can enjoy learning"" could be rephrased to ""learning becomes an enjoyable experience"" to demonstrate a more sophisticated use of language.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by presenting their opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. However, their essay lacks coherence and clarity in presenting their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and logical structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the difficulties of having broad knowledge to stating that specializing in one subject is better. A more effective approach would be to provide a clear thesis statement at the beginning, followed by supporting reasons and examples.

The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""If you want to have broad knowledge, you have to work hard on everything. This way is very difficult for people"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. Similarly, the phrase ""you can not achive something properly"" should be ""you cannot achieve something properly."" Furthermore, the student uses simplistic vocabulary, such as ""very difficult"" and ""some adventages,"" which can be replaced with more precise and formal language.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not well-supported. While they mention some potential advantages of specializing in one subject, such as being able to do research broadly and knowing everything about the subject, they fail to provide concrete examples or evidence to back up their claims.

Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure. The writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it challenging to follow the logical flow of the argument. For instance, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph is abrupt, and the writer fails to provide a clear connection between the two ideas. This lack of coherence makes it difficult for the reader to understand the writer's train of thought.

Similarly, ""People who are successful are good at everything the aim to be good at"" should be ""People who are successful aim to be good at everything."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to take the writer's argument seriously.

Thirdly, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simplistic phrases and clichés. For instance, ""To be something more than ordinary"" is a vague phrase that does not add much depth to the argument. The writer could have used more nuanced language to convey their ideas.

For instance, the sentence ""personally, i don't agree this statment in all of this part"" should be rephrased as ""Personally, I don't agree with this statement in all aspects."" Additionally, the use of ""infact"" instead of ""in fact"" is a common error that can be easily corrected.

The essay also touches on the idea that innovation and entrepreneurship are often the result of risk-taking, which is a valid point.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement. The student's agreement with the statement is not explicitly stated until the final sentence, which makes it difficult to follow the writer's argument.

The mention of the financial markets is also a good point, but it is not fully developed.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the statement. They have also attempted to use examples and reasons to support their answer. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""why I used 'tend' above is that that is a possibility, not an absolute solution"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""becuase it's new!"" (missing apostrophe). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions, such as ""money bag"" and ""fileds"" (typo). While these expressions may be common in informal writing, they are not suitable for formal essays.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence are not always clear. For example, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the sentence ""I am aiming great-great success like I wrote above"" seems out of place.

Finally, the student's use of examples is not always effective. While they mention the example of fossil fuel depletion, they do not fully explain how this relates to the statement. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""great-great success"" is unclear and may be confusing.

The student has attempted to express their opinion on the given statement, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of English language. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and a lack of proper paragraphing. 

The student starts by disagreeing with the statement but fails to provide a clear and concise explanation. The first reason provided, ""continuing one thing for a long time is capable to make the man success,"" is a vague statement that does not directly address the original statement. The example of a doctor searching for a cure is an attempt to support this point, but it is not well-explained and lacks a clear connection to the original statement.

The second reason, ""trying new things is the mean to throw away old things,"" is a confusing statement that seems to suggest that trying new things is a negative action. The student then introduces a hypothetical scenario where old things that were thrown away may bring great chances, but this is not a clear or logical argument.

The third reason, ""obeying that statement has the possibility of losing the tradition,"" is a grammatically incorrect statement that seems to suggest that following the original statement would lead to a loss of tradition. The student then concludes by stating that looking at old things and low-risk factors may make us successful, but this is not a clear or convincing argument.

Throughout the essay, the student struggles to use proper grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures. The writing lacks coherence and flow, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide their opinion on the statement. However, their writing contains several areas that need improvement. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""but would usually disagree with it when it comes to studying in a University"" seems disconnected from the previous sentence. Additionally, the student uses informal language and grammatical errors, such as ""for example at school,"" ""real beneficial,"" ""or I think it would,"" ""or can specialize in that subject more implies I could gain the masters and then the doctorate degrees more easilly,"" and ""having onformation on various subhjects."" These errors make the text difficult to understand.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported. While they mention some potential benefits of having broad knowledge, such as having ""many basic information in many subjects,"" they fail to provide concrete examples or evidence to back up their claims. The student also relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""having broad knowledge in an academic is realy benificial i life and may help."" 

On the other hand, the student attempts to address potential counterarguments and acknowledges that some people might disagree with their opinion. However, this section is not well-integrated into the rest of the essay and feels like an afterthought.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. They do not provide a clear thesis statement or a well-structured argument. The essay feels more like a collection of loosely connected ideas rather than a cohesive piece of writing.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The student jumps between ideas without providing a clear and logical flow of arguments.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples and supporting evidence to back up the student's claims. The student relies heavily on general statements and vague examples, such as ""as you grow more mature you will realize that the things you learned in school really comes to help in the real life."" This statement is not supported by any concrete evidence or specific examples, making it difficult to understand the student's point.

The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""necessarly"" should be spelled as ""necessarily,"" ""unlimited knowledge"" is not a correct phrase, and ""secluded"" is misspelled as ""secluded and feel alone."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

Despite these challenges, the student attempts to provide some relevant points, such as the idea that having broad knowledge of many subjects can help individuals appreciate other people's opinions and lead a more successful life. However, these points are not fully developed and lack supporting evidence.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, providing three specific reasons to support their disagreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The essay is well-structured, with each reason presented in a separate paragraph. The student has also provided personal anecdotes and examples to illustrate their points, which is a good practice for second language learners.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""phisical advantaged"" (should be ""physical advantages""), ""going to schools"" (should be ""attending school""), ""claases"" (should be ""classes""), ""timer"" (should be ""time""), ""at a law school"" (should be ""at law school""), ""abrod"" (should be ""abroad""), ""motels"" (should be ""motels"" is correct, but ""motel"" is more commonly used in American English, in British English, it is ""motel"" is not used, instead, ""hotel"" or ""guesthouse"" is used), ""oder"" (should be ""older""), and ""youg"" (should be ""young""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words such as ""enjoy"" and ""life"". More varied vocabulary would enhance the essay's overall impact. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, such as ""I do some part time job because I need money to socialize"". A more concise and natural way to express this idea would be ""I work part-time to earn money for socializing"".

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effectively summarized, as it seems to contradict the initial statement. The student argues that older people enjoy life more than young people, which is the opposite of the original statement. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the student's initial stance and summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."" However, there are several areas that require improvement to make the essay more effective.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts with a vague statement ""Some people prefer specific academic subjects than many academic subjects,"" which does not directly address the prompt. The student then proceeds to agree with the statement, but the reasons provided are not well-organized and lack specific examples to support their claims.

The student attempts to provide three reasons for specializing in one subject: becoming an expert, getting professional development and better job opportunities, and solving specific problems. However, the explanations for these reasons are brief and lack concrete examples. For instance, the example of a person with a Ph.D. in Microeconomics being able to develop theories about consumer behavior is not well-explained, and the connection to the national economy is not clear.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""thhis prefences,"" ""proffesional develop,"" and ""bets a jobs."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

In terms of content, the student's essay could benefit from more nuanced and balanced arguments. While they argue that specializing in one subject is beneficial, they do not consider the potential drawbacks of specialization, such as limited knowledge in other areas or the risk of becoming outdated in a rapidly changing field.

To improve, the student should focus on providing clear and concise writing, organizing their ideas more effectively, and providing more specific and detailed examples to support their claims. They should also consider addressing potential counterarguments to strengthen their argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, providing both arguments for and against the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student has also provided relevant examples to support their claims, such as the story of the man who started a small coffee shop and the example of car makers following Henry Ford's lead.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""I prefere the idea that people should try to do best within their ability and resources"" should be ""I prefer the idea that people should try to do their best within their ability and resources."" Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words like ""success"" and ""successful.""

The student's analysis of the topic is also somewhat superficial. While they provide examples, they do not delve deeply into the underlying reasons why trying new things and taking risks is essential for success. For example, they mention that knowing one's limitations can be a form of success, but they do not explain why this is the case.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points. They state that truly successful people are those who do new things and take high risks, but they do not reiterate why this is the case or provide any final thoughts on the topic.

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat unclear and lacks a direct response to the prompt. The essay starts by mentioning an unrelated article about the comparison between female and male, which is not relevant to the prompt. The student then shifts the focus to the comparison between young and old people, but the connection between the two topics is not explicitly stated. A more effective introduction would have directly addressed the prompt and provided a clear thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, which affects the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. For example, ""considered about these piece of paper a very long time"" should be ""considered this article for a very long time,"" and ""neverthelesse"" should be ""nevertheless."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, which makes the essay seem repetitive and monotonous.

Thirdly, the student provides some good points to support their argument, such as the idea that young people live more active lives and older people have gathered experience. However, these points are not fully developed, and the student could have provided more specific examples and evidence to strengthen their argument.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student states that neither young nor old people enjoy their life more, but this conclusion is not fully supported by the previous arguments.

Strengths:

1.  The essay begins with a relevant and engaging introduction that sets the context for the discussion on transportation and urbanization. The use of the term ""homo-urbanis"" is an interesting choice, although it may not be familiar to all readers.
2.  The student provides two compelling reasons to support the claim: the development of public transportation systems and the expected rise in fuel prices.

The first reason, which highlights the importance of repetition in achieving success, is well-supported by specific examples from Japanese traditional arts, craftmakers, and professional baseball players. These examples effectively illustrate the idea that success can be achieved through continuous practice and repetition of familiar tasks. However, the student could have further elaborated on how these examples relate to the original statement, making the connection more explicit.

The second reason, which emphasizes the need for consistency in focus, is also well-presented. The student's point about someone who constantly changes their focus not being able to achieve success is a valid one, but it could have been more effectively linked to the original statement. The student could have also provided more concrete examples to support this point.

In terms of language use, the student demonstrates a good command of basic sentence structures and vocabulary.

Firstly, the introduction is somewhat unclear and lacks a direct response to the prompt. The student states that they do not agree with the statement but does not explicitly explain why. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Befor I started studying medicin,"" ""pepole,"" ""sicnificant,"" and ""month."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Additionally, there are instances of awkward phrasing and sentence structure, such as ""I'm going to explain my point of view with some examples"" and ""It is a question of view!""

The student's use of examples is a strength of the essay. The two anecdotes provided are engaging and effectively illustrate the student's point that people's enjoyment of life is subjective and dependent on individual perspectives. The contrast between the older woman's positivity and the younger woman's despair highlights the complexity of the issue.

However, the student could have further developed these examples by analyzing them more deeply. For instance, they could have explored the specific factors that contributed to the older woman's resilience and the younger woman's despair. This would have added more depth and nuance to the essay.

Firstly, the writer's first point about young people being more active than older people is a good starting point. However, the example provided is somewhat disconnected from the main idea. The anecdote about hiking Mt. Fuji is interesting, but it doesn't directly relate to the physical activity level of young people. A more effective approach would be to provide a clear comparison between the physical abilities of young and old people, using specific examples or statistics to support the claim.

Secondly, the writer's second point about young people having fewer experiences is somewhat accurate, but the explanation is unclear. The writer states that young people ""need having a lot of experiences,"" which seems to be a contradictory statement. A more coherent explanation would be to argue that young people have more opportunities to gain new experiences and learn from them, whereas older people may have already accumulated a wealth of experiences.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay. The statement ""If they enjoyed their life, they will be a good person"" seems to be a separate idea that doesn't logically follow from the previous arguments.

In terms of grammar and vocabulary, the essay contains numerous errors, such as ""young people is,"" ""olders,"" ""defferent,"" ""everithing,"" and ""examine."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the best way to travel, which is in a group led by a tour guide. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which makes it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. 

One of the significant strengths of the essay is the student's use of personal experiences and examples to support their argument. For instance, the story about the foreign travelers in Hunan province who were helped by a local tour guide is a compelling example of the importance of having a guide during travel. Additionally, the student's familiarity with their hometown, Shanghai, and its historical significance is evident in the examples they provide.

However, the essay is marred by several weaknesses. Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""the tour guide is very meaningful word for me"" instead of ""the tour guide is a very meaningful word for me."" Moreover, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentences that lack variety. For example, the sentence ""For the starter, the tour guide must be the person who live in the local place that traveling destination"" could be rephrased to ""Firstly, a tour guide should be a local resident of the destination.""

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported, and they fail to address potential counterarguments. For instance, they do not consider the possibility that travelers may prefer to explore destinations independently or that tour guides may not always be available or knowledgeable.

Lastly, the student's use of quotes is not entirely accurate. The quote ""Don't change your tour propose, but a guide will help"" is likely a mistranslation or misinterpretation of the original quote, which may have been ""Don't change your plans, but a guide will help.""

Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as citing a particular advertisement or product that they felt was misleading.

Furthermore, the student's use of grammar and punctuation is generally good, but there are some errors that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the student writes ""thay"" instead of ""they"" in one instance, and ""proffesional"" instead of ""professional"" in another.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and well-structured essay to support their opinion. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the importance of learning facts and concepts. However, the essay demonstrates several areas that require improvement. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. The opening sentence, ""The idea that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts neither looks logic nor rational,"" is a vague statement that does not effectively convey the student's position on the topic. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of learning facts to providing examples of inventions and innovations. A more cohesive essay would have used transitional phrases to connect these ideas and create a smoother flow.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, which affects the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For example, the student uses ""logic"" instead of ""logical,"" ""mixed out ideas"" instead of ""mixed-up ideas,"" and ""scientic"" instead of ""scientific."" Additionally, there are several instances of subject-verb agreement errors, such as ""it is sort of chronological process"" instead of ""it is a chronological process.""

Despite these challenges, the student has attempted to provide some relevant examples to support their argument, such as the importance of learning facts for inventions and innovations. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student could have provided more concrete evidence to strengthen their argument.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would have restated the thesis statement and provided a final thought on the importance of learning facts and concepts.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""Allready,"" ""makin,"" ""Deemands,"" ""serviced,"" and ""cunsomer."" These mistakes detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions, such as ""way of reaching their purpose is makin to admire consumer."" This lack of varied vocabulary restricts the student's ability to convey their ideas effectively.

The student attempts to provide an example with the orange juice advertisement, but their analysis is superficial and lacks depth. They fail to critically evaluate the advertisement's message and instead focus on listing various possible themes, such as power, energy, sex, and health. The student also fails to provide a clear connection between the advertisement's message and the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are.

Additionally, the student's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize their main points. They mention that a successful advertisement is determined by the rate of consumers, but this point is not well-supported and seems disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, their essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas, and some sentences seem disconnected from the main argument. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the influence of the food industry on young people's perceptions of body image. This shows that the writer is capable of providing concrete reasons to support their opinion. Additionally, the writer attempts to acknowledge their own generation's flaws, which is a commendable effort to take responsibility and show self-awareness.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. The writer often uses colloquial expressions and slang (e.g., ""nonsence,"" ""spoil them to no ends,"" ""yoiuth""), which may make the text harder to understand for some readers. Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for an academic essay. The writer also deviates from the topic slightly, discussing the concept of perfection and its impact on young people, although they attempt to connect it to the main argument.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing more cohesive and organized ideas, using more formal language, and staying on topic. With practice and attention to these areas, the writer has the potential to produce a more effective and well-structured essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively disagreeing with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the argument. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of language accuracy, coherence, and depth of analysis.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided concrete examples to support their argument, such as the physics experiment and the exam scenario in a biological course. These examples help to illustrate the importance of facts in learning.
2. The student has attempted to address potential counterarguments, such as the idea that exams may allow students to refer to books, and has provided a counterpoint to this argument.
3. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the relevance of facts in real-life situations, such as finding a job as a programmer.

Weaknesses:

1. The student's language is often simplistic and lacks precision, with errors in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. For example, ""how come the ideas and concepts?"" is a colloquial expression that is not suitable for formal writing, and ""ttey can save the time spent on referring to the books"" contains a typo.
2. The student's transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the connections between ideas could be more explicitly stated.
3. The student's analysis of the topic is not particularly nuanced, and the argument could be strengthened by considering multiple perspectives and complexities.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. However, there are some areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided a clear thesis statement and has supported it with various points, including the lack of community opportunities in large cities, the busy schedules of young people, and the benefits of community work. The student has also shown an awareness of the importance of social contact and integration in the community.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""remeber"" instead of ""remember,"" ""where"" instead of ""whereas,"" and ""wich"" instead of ""which."" These errors can make the essay difficult to follow and detract from the student's overall message.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentence structures. For example, the student writes, ""Another point is the fact that nowadays young people have a lot more to do and not that much time like it was years ago."" A more sophisticated sentence structure, such as ""One of the key factors contributing to the lack of community involvement among young people is the increasingly busy schedules they face,"" would demonstrate a higher level of writing proficiency.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of community work to stating that young people do not give enough time to their communities. A more logical connection between these ideas would strengthen the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective. Instead of simply restating their thesis, the student could summarize the main points and reiterate their opinion in a more convincing manner.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy. The writer seems to be arguing that advertisements are essential for selling products, but their main point is somewhat obscured by numerous tangential statements and unclear connections between ideas.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the writer's failure to directly address the prompt. The statement ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is not explicitly supported or refuted until the final sentence. The writer's main argument appears to be that advertisements are crucial for selling products, rather than evaluating their effectiveness in portraying products in a more favorable light.

The writer provides some relevant examples, such as Coca-cola and fast food advertisements, but these are not effectively used to support their argument. Instead, they seem to be used to illustrate the importance of advertisements in general. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence or specific examples to support their claims, relying on general statements and vague assertions.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often unclear and difficult to follow. There are numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. The writer also struggles to use transitional phrases and cohesive language to connect their ideas.

However, the writer does attempt to engage with the topic and provide some relevant examples. They also demonstrate a basic understanding of the role of advertisements in marketing and sales.

2. They have taken a clear stance on the issue, disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
3. The student has attempted to consider different perspectives, such as the challenges of living in a big city versus a small village.

Weaknesses:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, expressing their opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. They provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a good start. However, the essay could be improved in several areas.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases and connect their ideas logically. For instance, they use phrases like ""But how?"" and ""So if we wish to solve this problem"" to link their ideas together. Additionally, they provide some relevant examples, such as the burden of homework and extracurricular activities, to support their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence in some parts. For example, the sentence ""Without these corrections to our education system, schools would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is not always accurate. For instance, they use the word ""responsibillity"" instead of ""responsibility."" Lastly, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issue. The student's solutions, such as decreasing the amount of homework and extracurricular activities, are somewhat simplistic and do not fully address the complexity of the issue.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be more engaging and persuasive. While they express their opinion clearly, they do not provide enough evidence to convince the reader of their point of view.

However, the essay is marred by several grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's effort to provide specific reasons and examples to support their opinion. For instance, they mention that young people have the physical energy to work all day without sleeping and that they don't feel responsibilities for society or family, which allows them to challenge themselves without hesitation. These points are relevant to the topic and demonstrate a good understanding of the subject matter.

However, the student's writing is often unclear due to grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Ofcouse there is also chance to enjoy older age however it ups to younger age which people had spended"" is difficult to understand because of the incorrect use of ""Ofcouse"" and ""ups."" Similarly, the sentence ""In the phisical, they are so young that they can work all of the day without sleeping, sometimes"" contains a spelling error in ""phisical"" and an awkward phrase ""sometimes.""

For instance, the sentence ""I disagree with stateman that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities becouse the young spend many of his or her time to help the person that have some disabilities and also help the older people, for this reasons the statement is wrong"" is a jumbled mix of ideas and contains several grammatical errors. A more polished sentence structure would be ""I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because many young people spend a significant amount of time helping people with disabilities and older individuals.""

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of incorrect word choice. For example, the phrase ""the true problems isn't his inability to do something but is the necessity to speack and play with other persons same to him or her"" could be rephrased as ""the true problem is not their inability to do something, but rather the need for social interaction and companionship with others like them.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the topic and consider multiple perspectives. The writer recognizes that enjoyment of life is not solely dependent on physical aspects and that older people can also find joy in their experiences and wisdom. This shows a good understanding of the topic and a willingness to think critically.

However, the essay could benefit from more focused and specific examples to support the writer's arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, providing three main reasons to support their opinion that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided specific examples to support their arguments, such as the need for a tour guide in a foreign country where the local language is not the traveler's mother tongue.
2.  The essay covers a range of aspects, including cultural awareness, access to information, and safety, which are all relevant to the topic.
3.  The student has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""Also,"" ""The second reason,"" and ""All in all,"" which helps to create a cohesive text.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity.
2.  Some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""How can we obtain such an information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide having lots of interesting information about the city?"" could be rephrased for better flow.

The essay provides a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer supports their argument with specific reasons and examples, which is a good practice for second language learners. However, there are areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs. For instance, the writer uses ""To begin with"" and ""In addition"" to introduce new points, which helps to create a logical flow of ideas. Additionally, the writer provides concrete examples to support their arguments, such as the anecdote about the writer's brother and the statistic from KBS, Korea national broadcast station.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language is sometimes simplistic and lacks variety. For example, the sentence ""Young people think they can move other places whenever they want to move"" could be rephrased to make it more sophisticated. Secondly, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""necessarity"" and ""sacrifying"" being used incorrectly. Lastly, the writer's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points more clearly and provided a more nuanced final thought.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt and providing their opinion on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention that older people enjoy relaxing activities such as reading, gardening, and spending time with their grandchildren. They also provide a contrasting example of young people spending too much time on computers and TVs, which they perceive as boring to older people.

However, the essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For example, ""Every people enjoy to do different things"" should be ""Everyone enjoys doing different things."" Additionally, ""the otherside"" should be ""the other side,"" and ""enyoj"" should be ""enjoy.""

Furthermore, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the differences in activities between young and old people to stating that ""Everybody like to do different things."" A clearer transition between ideas would improve the essay's overall coherence.

The student also struggles with vocabulary, using words like ""enjoying"" and ""enjoy"" interchangeably, and ""poeple"" instead of ""people."" Additionally, the sentence ""The fact is if you do the things which you really like your life is enjoying"" is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased.

Evaluation: 

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the given statement, but it is marred by numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors. The writer's ideas are somewhat coherent, but they lack clarity and organization. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more specific examples to support the writer's claims.

One of the major strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal experiences and observations to support their argument. For instance, when the writer mentions that they can use computers and their mother can cook, it shows that they are aware of the differences between their generation and their parents'. However, these examples are not fully developed and could be more effectively integrated into the essay.

The writer also attempts to address potential counterarguments, stating that older people can still have fun and that every person takes what they must from life. However, this point is not fully explored, and the writer could have provided more evidence to support this claim.

The essay's language is often simplistic, with many basic sentence structures and vocabulary. While this is understandable for a second language learner, it detracts from the overall impact of the writer's message. Additionally, there are several instances of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and tense consistency, which make the text difficult to follow at times.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their language skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. They should also strive to provide more specific and detailed examples to support their arguments and develop their ideas more fully.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three main points to support their agreement with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""completly agree,"" ""no of things,"" ""consiredered,"" ""leveing,"" ""easil,"" and ""completly paced."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions and informal language, such as ""sort of cheating the people"" and ""one of the biggest magic or thing."" This lack of precision and formality undermines the student's ability to convey their ideas effectively.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence are lacking. The essay jumps abruptly from one point to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the student starts by discussing cellular services, then shifts to products like soaps and shampoos, and finally mentions celebrities and drinks. A clearer structure and more logical flow would have improved the essay's overall impact.

Despite these issues, the student has attempted to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as the advertising of cellular services, products like soaps and shampoos, and the use of celebrities in advertisements. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student could have provided more detailed analysis and evidence to strengthen their argument.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides specific examples, such as the architect's need for knowledge of physics and mathematics, as well as the importance of studying history and geography.

Strengths:

1. The student effectively uses examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and convincing.
2. The writing is clear and easy to understand, with proper grammar and sentence structure.
3. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and its implications.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the benefits of broad knowledge. The student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""with knowledge comes power, and with power comes responsibility.""
2. Some sentences, such as ""We now remember that Mt. Everest is 8997 Metres high and is going higher every year,"" seem unnecessary and detract from the main argument.
3. The student could have explored counterarguments and addressed potential criticisms of their stance.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Provide more specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate the benefits of broad knowledge.
2. Elaborate on the potential drawbacks of specializing in one subject, such as limited job opportunities or a narrow perspective.
3. Consider addressing potential counterarguments and responding to them in a clear and concise manner.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their personal opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks a clear and direct response to the prompt, as the student shifts the focus to their own experience and the characteristics of young people rather than directly addressing the statement.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps between different ideas and examples without a clear logical flow, making it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the student starts by asking a rhetorical question, then provides a personal opinion, and later shifts to a comparison between young people and adults. This lack of coherence makes it challenging to understand the student's main point.

In terms of language, the student struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of tenses, and missing articles. Additionally, the student uses simple vocabulary and lacks variety in sentence structure, which makes the writing seem flat and unengaging.

However, the student attempts to provide some supporting evidence, such as the example of a young boy not caring about his mother's actions, and the idea that young people are not burdened by financial and job problems. These examples, although not well-developed, demonstrate the student's effort to engage with the topic.

To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and direct response to the prompt, organizing their ideas logically, and using more complex vocabulary and sentence structures. They should also proofread their work to eliminate grammatical errors.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt by providing a mixed response, agreeing and disagreeing with the statement at the same time. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its argument. The student provides examples of cars and food to support their claim, but the examples are not well-organized and lack specific details to make a strong case.

One of the major issues with the essay is the use of vague language and grammatical errors. Phrases such as ""I do not like"" and ""I do not care"" are not specific enough to support the student's argument. Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions like ""dengoures thing"" and ""Montion"" detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student also fails to provide a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to follow their argument. The essay jumps between different topics, such as cars and food, without a clear connection between them. Furthermore, the student's conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize their main points.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with two main points (visual and psychological effects) that support the argument. The student has provided specific examples and explanations to illustrate their points, which is a good practice for second language learners.

However, there are areas for improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they could have mentioned specific advertisements that exemplify the visual and psychological effects they are discussing. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, ""excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewers"" could be rephrased as ""advertisements often use visual tricks to grab viewers' attention.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the topic. While they acknowledge that the visual and psychological effects can lead to a distorted perception of products, they could have explored the implications of this phenomenon in more depth. For example, they could have discussed how this can lead to consumerism, waste, or the exploitation of consumers.

Lastly, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points more clearly and provided a more concrete call to action. The student's final sentence, ""This is when you realize you've made the wrong decision,"" feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher score. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide reasons and examples to support their answer. The student mentions two main points: the ability to concentrate and the ability to retain information. However, the explanations and examples provided are not fully developed and lack clarity.

For instance, the student states that learning facts is easy and can be done by simply listening to a lecture, but this is not a convincing argument. A more effective approach would be to provide specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the student's explanation of how understanding ideas and concepts improves concentration is vague and could be more effectively supported with concrete examples.

Furthermore, the student's writing contains several grammatical errors, such as ""I think only listening to the lecture can say people are learning"" (should be ""can say that people are learning"") and ""the theory that I only listen to at the science class is forgotten soon"" (should be ""the theory that I only listened to at the science class is forgotten soon""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction and conclusion.

The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support the argument, including the lack of emphasis on community service in education, the influence of family and school, and the busy curriculum of young people. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their personal experience, such as the school's community service activities being stopped due to cost. This adds a sense of authenticity to the argument and helps to engage the reader. Additionally, the student attempts to address potential counterarguments, such as the idea that young people are too busy with schoolwork, and suggests alternative uses of their time.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""thier"" instead of ""their"", ""comminities"" instead of ""communities"", and ""younsters"" instead of ""youngsters"". These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain unclear phrasing, such as ""if you are willingto help your community you shouldn't wait earning money"".

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. While the student identifies some potential reasons why young people may not be helping their communities, they do not fully explore the complexities of the issue. For example, they do not consider the potential benefits of community service for young people, such as developing social skills and building character.

Firstly, the student's writing is generally clear, but there are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in verb tense usage throughout the essay.

Additionally, there are several spelling mistakes, such as ""broading"" instead of ""broadening,"" ""studnt"" instead of ""student,"" and ""peroblems"" instead of ""problems.""

Secondly, the student's argument is not well-supported with specific examples or evidence.

For instance, they mention that a student who studies education, social studies, politics, arts, and math will be able to understand their country's problems, but they do not explain how this knowledge will help them make a difference.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to sharing a personal anecdote about choosing a career path.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of tenses, and sentence structure problems. For instance, in the first paragraph, the sentence ""People get education because the knowledge serves as the background setting for young adults which means that those complex math questions or the dates for a historical events are not applied directly on the society"" is convoluted and difficult to understand. Similarly, in the second paragraph, the sentence ""The first reason is because if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts, you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster"" lacks a clear connection to the rest of the paragraph.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples to support their arguments is limited and often lacks depth. While the anecdote about report cards is a good start, it could be developed further to provide more insight into the student's thought process. Additionally, the example about remembering math formulas is a common one, but it could be made more specific and relevant to the context of the essay.

In terms of content, the student's arguments are not always well-supported. For instance, the statement ""Understanding facts helps your knowledge be installed in your brain in shorter amount of time with positive attitude towards it"" is not entirely clear, and the connection to the rest of the essay is tenuous at best.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer expressing a disagreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer provides personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, which is a good approach for second language learners. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's use of vivid descriptions and examples from their personal experience. For instance, the image of grandparents sitting on a bench with their dog is a powerful way to convey the idea that older people's enjoyment of life may be different from that of young people. The writer also effectively uses quotes from their grandmother to illustrate her perspective on life, which adds depth to the essay.

However, there are several areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets out the writer's argument more explicitly. While the writer disagrees with the statement, it is not entirely clear what they mean by ""enjoyment"" or how they define it. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to fully understand the writer's argument.

Additionally, the writer could provide more evidence to support their claim. While the anecdotes are engaging, they are not sufficient to convince the reader that older people enjoy life more than young people. The writer could consider providing more examples or statistics to back up their argument.

Furthermore, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which detract from the writer's overall message. For example, ""leesh"" should be spelled ""leash,"" ""sleighed"" should be spelled ""slid,"" and ""fulfiment"" should be spelled ""fulfillment."" These errors suggest that the writer needs to work on proofreading and editing their work more carefully.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and reiterate the writer's thesis more clearly. As it stands, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and does not leave the reader with a lasting impression.

For instance, ""i think that is true,young people don't give enough time to helping their communities"" should be ""I think that it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities."" Similarly, ""The gift that a young people take to his life coach"" should be ""The gifts that young people take to their life coaches.""

The student attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but these are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence. For example, the statement ""Family, school, friends and tv and all of the things that a person do in the first part of his life will influence his personality"" is a vague and unsubstantiated claim. The student also fails to provide specific examples of how these factors influence a person's personality.

On the other hand, the student does attempt to provide a personal example of their own experience working in a call center, which shows some level of engagement with the topic. However, this example is not fully developed and could be used more effectively to support their argument.

In terms of vocabulary, the student uses some basic vocabulary, but there are opportunities to use more complex and nuanced language to express their ideas. For instance, instead of using ""very, very, very important,"" the student could use a more precise phrase such as ""extremely crucial.""

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt by presenting both sides of the argument and providing personal experiences to support their stance. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a clear thesis statement or logical connections between paragraphs. The writing also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, which hinder the overall understanding of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from their personal experiences, such as attending different classes in undergraduate school and concentrating on sports medicine classes in physical therapy school. These examples demonstrate the student's understanding of the topic and their ability to think critically about the benefits of broad knowledge and specialization.

However, the student's writing could be improved by providing more nuanced and detailed explanations of their ideas. For instance, when discussing the benefits of broad knowledge, the student mentions that it ""adds to human experience and provides possible solutions in many situations,"" but does not elaborate on what specific experiences or solutions they are referring to. Similarly, when discussing the benefits of specialization, the student mentions that it helped them ""apply for master degree and find convenient job,"" but does not explain how their specialization in sports medicine specifically contributed to these outcomes.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on providing more detailed and specific examples, as well as clearer explanations of their ideas. They should also work on organizing their essay in a more logical and coherent manner, with a clear thesis statement and transitions between paragraphs.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing reasons and examples to support their agreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the major issues is the lack of clear and concise sentence structure. The student often uses short, fragmented sentences that make it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, in the first paragraph, the student writes, ""If they wont keep tour guide they takes much time to know about the place."" This sentence is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased to ""If they don't have a tour guide, they will take much time to know about the place.""

Another issue is the use of vocabulary. The student often uses colloquial expressions and informal language, which is not suitable for an academic essay. For example, the student writes, ""he doesnt get interest to watch the palces"" which should be rephrased to ""he doesn't get interested in watching the places.""

In terms of content, the student provides some relevant examples, such as the industrial tour of engineering students and office staff visiting higher industries. However, these examples are not fully developed and could be expanded upon to provide more insight into the benefits of traveling in a group led by a tour guide.

The student also uses some transitional phrases, such as ""At the same time"" and ""Anyways,"" which are not always used correctly. For instance, in the third paragraph, the student writes, ""Anyways thats all depends on the individuals but going along with group makes the individual to see the things happily and great scope to have good knowledge on place what they see."" This sentence is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased to ""However, it ultimately depends on the individual, but traveling in a group can make the experience more enjoyable and provide a great opportunity to gain knowledge about the place.""

Overall, the student has made an effort to address the prompt, but there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""The young are happier,have more energy,and don't think to much in the consecuenses of an action"" is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased to ""Young people are generally happier, have more energy, and are less concerned about the consequences of their actions."" This correction would improve the sentence's clarity and grammatical accuracy.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of incorrect word usage. For example, ""peolple"" should be spelled as ""people,"" and ""whith"" should be spelled as ""with."" Additionally, the student could have used more precise and varied vocabulary to describe the activities young people enjoy, such as ""attending concerts"" instead of ""listening to the music"" or ""going to the movies.""

The student's comparison between young and old people is somewhat superficial, relying on generalizations rather than specific examples. For instance, the statement ""Old people are more conservatives"" is not supported by any concrete evidence. To strengthen this point, the student could have provided specific examples of how older people's values and behaviors differ from those of younger people.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. While the student has listed various activities that young people enjoy, they have not explored the underlying reasons behind these preferences or how they relate to the statement. To improve this, the student could have delved deeper into the psychological, social, or cultural factors that contribute to young people's enjoyment of life.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. The student's writing is riddled with errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure, which makes it challenging to understand their ideas. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The student starts by stating their disagreement with the prompt, but fails to provide a clear explanation or supporting evidence in the subsequent paragraphs. The essay meanders through various examples, but these examples are not well-integrated or effectively linked to the main argument.

The student attempts to provide examples of young people helping their communities, such as the charity basketball game after Hurricane Katrina and young people helping the elderly. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student fails to provide sufficient context or explanation. The writing also lacks specific details and supporting evidence to make the examples more convincing.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""i desagree,"" ""shouln't,"" ""peolpe,"" and ""cmmu."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and organization. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which hinder the reader's understanding of the content. For instance, ""in spite of the large number of cars, the planes numbers in growing"" should be ""despite the large number of cars, the number of planes is growing."" Similarly, ""the big reason that in the air there are no traffic jams (at least until now)"" should be ""one of the main reasons that there are no traffic jams in the air (at least for now).""

The writer attempts to provide reasons for their opinion, such as the benefits of traveling by plane (e.g., speed, safety, and the ability to transport large quantities of items). However, these points are not adequately developed or supported with concrete evidence. For example, the writer states that ""planes can transport a large quantity of things and in no time,"" but fails to provide specific examples or statistics to back up this claim.

The writer also makes some interesting predictions about the future, such as the development of smaller planes, the opening of pilot schools for ordinary people, and the creation of taxi planes. However, these ideas are not well-supported and seem to be based on speculation rather than concrete evidence.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of planes to talking about the potential risks of traveling by plane (e.g., kidnapping). This lack of coherence makes it challenging to understand the writer's overall argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, agreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay provides some valid reasons and examples to support this claim, such as the need to reduce pollution and the importance of implementing ecological alternatives. However, the essay also shows some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use transitional phrases and connect their ideas, such as ""We must change that. It is not difficult"" and ""I see a world in the future..."". This indicates a good understanding of the importance of cohesion in writing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""there is too muche pollution"" (should be ""there is too much pollution""), ""becomed"" (should be ""become""), ""behevior"" (should be ""behavior""), and ""pubblic"" (should be ""public""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with some words being used incorrectly or in an unnatural way, such as ""ecologic"" (should be ""ecological"") and ""its"" (should be ""their""). The student also relies heavily on simple sentences and lacks variety in sentence structure, which makes the essay feel a bit flat.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial, with the example of using public transport being the only concrete suggestion provided.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, providing three main reasons to support their disagreement with the statement. Their essay is well-structured, with each paragraph focusing on a specific point. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of language accuracy, coherence, and depth of analysis.

Strengths:

- The student has attempted to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, which is a good effort in terms of essay structure.
- They have provided some relevant examples to support their arguments, such as the importance of experiencing facts in the real world.
- The student has shown a clear understanding of the topic and has made an attempt to use vocabulary related to the subject matter.

Weaknesses:

- The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth in their analysis. For example, the statement ""It is more important for students to learn facts because it increases the willingness for students to learn as well as the ability to perform better in various situations in the real world"" could be supported with more concrete evidence or examples.
- There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""The students will not have chance to confirm that what they know is true"" (should be ""The students will not have the chance to confirm what they know is true"").
- The student could benefit from using more nuanced language and avoiding repetitive phrases, such as ""it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts"" (which is repeated in the first and last sentences).

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. However, their essay is marred by numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, which hinder the clarity and coherence of their argument. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific examples to support their claim. For instance, they mention the importance of having experts in various fields to understand complex topics and provide solutions to problems. The example of explaining the financial policy of a multinational company versus understanding how education can reduce violence in poor countries is a good illustration of the limitations of specialization.

However, the student's argument is not well-organized, and their ideas are not clearly connected. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of specialization to worrying about the consequences of becoming outdated in a rapidly changing society. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion that ties together their main points.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. They make sweeping statements, such as ""Learning about thing differents thing s it's the basememenmt of our society,"" without providing any supporting evidence or analysis. The student also uses colloquial expressions, such as ""qcqde;ics su,"" which detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. They have effectively used the example of Apple and IBM to illustrate the importance of innovation and taking risks in achieving success. The student has also provided specific details and examples to support their argument, such as Apple's continuous innovation and diversification of products.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided a more nuanced and balanced view by acknowledging potential counterarguments or limitations of their argument. For instance, they could have discussed how taking risks can sometimes lead to failure, and how IBM's failure was not solely due to their reluctance to innovate.

Additionally, the student could have provided more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to enhance the clarity and coherence of their writing. For example, instead of using the phrase ""keep doing what they thought they were able to do well,"" they could have used a more precise phrase such as ""relied on their existing strengths and market dominance.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more explicit connections between their ideas and the prompt, and could have used more transitional phrases to link their paragraphs together. For example, they could have used a transition phrase such as ""In contrast"" to link the discussion of Apple and IBM.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is concise and directly answers the question, but it lacks a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. A more effective introduction would have provided a concise overview of the main points to be discussed.

The body paragraph is where the student's ideas are presented, but it is marred by several issues. The student relies heavily on general statements and lacks specific examples to support their claims. For instance, the statement ""there are too many funny things on the internet"" is vague and does not provide concrete evidence to support the argument. Furthermore, the student's use of personal anecdotes, such as playing basketball with their father, is a good attempt to provide a personal perspective, but it is not directly related to the topic of young people helping their communities.

The student's writing also contains several grammatical errors, such as ""my only entertament"" (should be ""entertainment""), ""my faher"" (should be ""father""), and ""cusion's home"" (should be ""cousin's home""). These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

In terms of organization, the student's essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. A more effective essay would have a clear introduction, body paragraphs that provide specific examples and evidence, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points.

This would not only improve the sentence structure but also add more variety to the vocabulary.

Thirdly, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the transition from the second paragraph to the third paragraph is abrupt, and the connection between the ideas is not clear. The student could use transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas more effectively.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. The final sentence, ""If young people provide enjoyable life for elder people, the elder people have more enjoyable life than they used to have,"" seems to be a non-sequitur and does not logically follow from the rest of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in the introduction. The sentence ""it is not the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the given topic in itself is self explainatory"" is unclear and does not effectively introduce the essay. A more effective introduction would have provided a clear thesis statement and a brief overview of the main points to be discussed.

The student has made a sincere effort to address the prompt and provide their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts. The essay is well-structured, and the student has used examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the writing to a higher level.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and propose a middle ground between understanding ideas and learning facts. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the topic and the ability to think critically. The student also provides relevant examples, such as the use of technology to access information, which supports their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""instead of learning them"" (should be ""instead of learning facts""), ""solit knowledge"" (should be ""solid knowledge""), and ""repitition"" (should be ""repetition""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""When repitition is the aim then i would say that learning the facts is enough"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. Similarly, the sentence ""With that help it is just a matter of a few seconds to access the right topic and to get any information that is so enormous nobody could keep in mind"" could be rephrased to improve its flow and coherence.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention the use of technology to access information, they could provide more specific examples of how this affects the importance of understanding ideas and concepts.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly related to the topic. The sentence ""To come to a conclusion I wish that in many more fields then today already exist students learn the 'why' standing behind instead of just pure facts and knowledge they will never need in that particulaly case in the future"" is a bit unclear and could be rephrased for better impact.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. The writer has effectively used specific examples, such as the Diet Coke advertisement, to illustrate how products are often misrepresented in advertisements. The student has also shown an awareness of how advertisements can shape a person's identity and status.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The writing could benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures, as many of the sentences are simple and lack cohesion. Additionally, some of the vocabulary choices, such as ""practical use"" and ""practical meaning,"" could be more precise and idiomatic. Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the impact of advertisements on society.

The student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also somewhat limited, which makes the essay feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, the transition from the discussion of the Diet Coke advertisement to the general statement about advertisements rendering products better than they really are could be smoother.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student has demonstrated a clear and coherent argument, and their writing is generally clear and easy to understand.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. The essay is well-structured, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer. For instance, they mention that young people have more energy to go around different places and enjoy various activities, whereas older people may not be able to do so due to health issues. They also highlight the importance of having fewer responsibilities and more freedom to enjoy life at a younger age.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I dont think that this is a valid deal cause"" (should be ""I don't think that this is a valid deal because"") and ""with lot of things happening around you and that interests you"" (should be ""with a lot of things happening around you and that interests you""). These errors can make the essay difficult to understand and detract from the student's message.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive phrases such as ""at your younger age"" and ""at older age"" being used throughout the essay. This can make the writing seem monotonous and lacking in variety.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought or call to action.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, and the writer provides some relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

Firstly, the writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is often inaccurate, which affects the clarity and coherence of the text. For instance, ""prooven"" should be spelled as ""proven,"" ""refraind"" should be spelled as ""refrained,"" and ""oraganism"" should be spelled as ""organism."" Additionally, there are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, such as ""has endured"" and ""will become extinct,"" which should be consistent throughout the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's argument could be more effectively supported with more concrete examples and evidence. While the writer mentions the importance of adaptability, they could provide more specific examples of how broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be beneficial in real-life situations. The writer also jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of adaptability to mentioning the example of a person being jobless after a company goes bankrupt. A smoother transition between ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking. For example, the writer states that being a professional specialized in one field can serve one well in terms of economic security, but then immediately shifts to discussing the importance of broadening one's horizon. A clearer connection between these ideas would strengthen the writer's argument.

Finally, the writer's conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The writer states that broadening one's horizon grants a secure and fulfilled future, but this conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be more convincingly supported by the previous arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay provides specific examples from the student's personal experiences, showcasing their involvement in various community service activities, such as working for the ""red cross,"" helping their elderly neighbor, and looking after kids. These examples effectively support the student's argument and provide insight into their understanding of the topic.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as the ideas seem to jump abruptly from one example to another. Additionally, some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as ""colud"" instead of ""could,"" ""af"" instead of ""of,"" and ""it can seems"" instead of ""it seems."" Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the examples, rather than simply stating their experiences.

The student's writing also lacks variety in sentence structure and vocabulary. Many sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, which makes the essay feel somewhat flat. For instance, the sentence ""I did not do a great job, i just gave them attention, I spent time talking with them, and even if it can seems a little, for them it was a lot"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging and descriptive.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and provides specific examples to support their argument. Their writing shows potential, and with further practice and attention to detail, they can improve their writing skills.

Evaluation: 

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which significantly hinders the overall understanding of their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the use of vague and incorrect vocabulary, such as ""very important functions,"" ""panoramic scenary,"" ""conoscence,"" and ""permetted."" These words not only disrupt the flow of the essay but also demonstrate a lack of proficiency in using English language. 

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by specific examples or evidence. They claim that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows individuals to be prepared for every situation, but they fail to provide concrete instances to illustrate this point. This makes their argument seem unsubstantiated and weak.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks organization and coherence. The transitions between sentences and paragraphs are abrupt, making it difficult to follow their line of reasoning. The essay also contains grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of verb tenses.

However, the student does attempt to acknowledge that their preference for broad knowledge may not be applicable to everyone, which shows some level of self-awareness and understanding of the complexity of the issue.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether successful people try new things and take risks or stick to what they know well. However, their essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""I am not agree with this statmen,"" ""pople,"" ""dhey,"" ""faumest,"" and ""cen."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message. 

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning. They argue that successful people should stick to what they know well, citing examples such as a surgeon who stops practicing medicine to pursue another career. However, this example is not convincing, as it is unlikely that a surgeon would abandon their profession to take a risk. The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of why taking risks is inherently bad, instead stating that it may lead to loss of knowledge and fame. 

Additionally, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps between different ideas without a clear logical flow, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion, instead ending the essay abruptly.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing four reasons to support their agreement with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of English language. 

The student starts by stating four reasons but fails to provide a clear and logical connection between them. The essay jumps abruptly from one point to another without a smooth transition. For instance, the student shifts from discussing the color impression to sizes without explaining how the two are related.

Furthermore, the student's use of English is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. For example, ""I am eaasily faked by this strategy"" should be ""I am easily fooled by this strategy."" Additionally, ""My composition of the brain is, at first, color, and then, the personality"" is unclear and should be rephrased for better understanding.

The student attempts to provide specific examples to support their points, but these examples are not always relevant or effective. For instance, the example about the vintage shop is not directly related to the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The example about the famous person in a TV commercial is also unclear and lacks context.

- The student has not fully addressed the prompt, which asks for an agreement or disagreement with the statement. The student's essay seems to focus more on the importance of experience and practice rather than the specific statement about successful people trying new things and taking risks.
- The student's examples are not always relevant to the topic. For example, the story about dislocating their knee is more about perseverance and listening to doctors than taking risks and trying new things.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples and reasons to support their answer. For instance, they mention the influence of modern society and capitalism on young people's behavior, as well as the impact of globalization and internationalization on community unity. Additionally, the student provides personal anecdotes and examples of young people who are actively involved in helping their communities, such as volunteering for associations and helping the elderly.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and verb tense inconsistencies. For example, in the sentence ""The modern life make young people very nacisic and selfish,"" the verb ""make"" should be in the present tense to match the subject ""modern life."" Additionally, the student often uses colloquial expressions and slang, such as ""stuff"" and ""nacisic,"" which detract from the overall formality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and clichés, such as ""me and myself"" and ""pursuit and achieve our plans."" While the student attempts to use more complex vocabulary, such as ""internationalisation"" and ""identication,"" they often misuse or misapply these words. For example, ""identication"" should be ""identification.""

In terms of coherence, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the lack of motivation among young people to helping their communities to the student's personal experience of volunteering for an association. While the student attempts to connect these ideas, the transition is not smooth, and the reader may find it difficult to follow.

The essay provides a clear stance on the topic, stating that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer offers three main reasons to support this claim: the amount of free time, physical abilities, and opportunities to make new friends. 

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate. For instance, ""I beleive"" should be ""I believe,"" and ""the youngs"" should be ""young people."" Additionally, the sentence structure is sometimes simplistic, which can make the writing seem less engaging. For example, ""A typical older person would spend their time at work"" could be rephrased to ""Typically, older people spend most of their time working.""

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their claims. While the example about the young man who played football is a good start, it could be developed further to make it more convincing. Additionally, the writer could have explored other aspects of life, such as the emotional and social aspects, to provide a more comprehensive argument.

The writer also uses some general statements that could be supported with evidence. For instance, the statement ""the human body is constructed to become weaker and feable as they become older at a certain age"" could be backed up with scientific research or statistics to make it more convincing.

The student's writing is also hindered by a lack of clarity and concision. Many sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning. For example, the sentence ""Maybe is because they are living in a society that do not offers them what they are looking for and for that reason the are not in the mood to participate of their communities"" is unclear and contains several errors.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic or colloquial expressions. For instance, the use of ""his communiti"" instead of ""their community"" is a common error that detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and direct answer to the prompt, using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures, and avoiding grammatical errors. They should also strive to develop their ideas more fully and provide more relevant and effective examples to support their argument.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it is marred by several grammatical, syntactical, and lexical errors that hinder the overall coherence and clarity of the writing. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their opinion, but these are often vague and lack concrete evidence.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The writer seems to be arguing that young people do give enough time to their communities, but this is not explicitly stated in the introduction. The writer also fails to provide a logical flow of ideas, often jumping between different points without connecting them effectively.

The writer attempts to use examples to support their argument, such as the television show where young people donated money to charity and the historical adage from Hittite paper. However, these examples are not fully developed and lack context. The writer also makes a sweeping generalization that old people are guilty of complaining about young people, which is not supported by evidence.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""heve"" instead of ""have,"" ""oh"" instead of ""of,"" and ""r'd of"" instead of ""rid of."" The writer also struggles with sentence structure, often using simple sentences that lack variety.

Despite these issues, the writer demonstrates some understanding of the topic and attempts to engage with the prompt. The writer also shows some awareness of the historical context, referencing the Hittite paper.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement, but their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of English language. The student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect word choices, and a lack of proper sentence structure.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to provide a clear and logical argument. The student starts by disagreeing with the statement, but then proceeds to provide reasons that are not well-supported or connected to the main argument. For instance, the student mentions that people living in rural areas need cars, but this is not a convincing reason to argue that there will be more cars in use in twenty years.

The student also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. When discussing the environmental impact of cars, the student mentions that many countries are trying to reduce gas emissions, but does not provide any specific examples or statistics to back up this claim. Similarly, when discussing the limitations of electric cars, the student states that they take time to make cars run, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and misuse of articles. The student also uses simplistic and vague language, such as ""we do not care enviroment"" and ""we care only ourselves."" This lack of sophistication in language use makes it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

However, the student does attempt to provide some reasons to support their argument, such as the need for individual cars in rural areas and the limitations of public transportation. These points, if developed more fully and clearly, could have been effective in supporting the student's argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples from real-life advertisements, such as McDonald's and makeup commercials, to support their argument.

Strengths:

1. The student uses concrete examples to illustrate their point, making the argument more convincing and engaging.
2. The essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion that effectively summarize the main points.
3. The student demonstrates an understanding of the purpose of advertising and how it can be misleading.

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack descriptive language.
2. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""to be aware of adverstisement's tricks"" (should be ""advertisements' tricks"") and ""we can considerate make up advertisement"" (should be ""we can consider makeup advertisements"").

4. The student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the examples, rather than simply stating that they are misleading.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Vary sentence structure to create more interest and variety.

The essay demonstrates a clear and well-structured argument in response to the given prompt. The writer starts by acknowledging their initial disagreement with the statement, which shows a willingness to engage with the topic and consider multiple perspectives. However, they eventually agree with the statement, citing specific reasons and examples to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of relevant and concrete examples to illustrate the writer's points. For instance, the writer mentions the decrease in human interaction among young people due to the use of fast but impersonal modes of communication, which is a valid observation. Additionally, the writer suggests several practical ways in which young people can help their communities, such as tutoring younger kids or visiting the elderly, which shows a good understanding of the topic.

The writer also demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and grammar, using complex sentences and phrases such as ""I was forced to change my mind,"" ""it has become increasingly difficult,"" and ""I feel this can be achieved by getting the whole community involved."" However, there are some minor errors in punctuation and sentence structure, such as the use of a comma splice in the sentence ""Young people, with their natural energy and enthusiasm can come up with bright and innovative ways of helping their community.""

To improve the essay, the writer could provide more specific and detailed examples to support their arguments. For instance, they could describe a particular community project or initiative that they have been involved in, or provide statistics or research to back up their claims. Additionally, the writer could work on varying their sentence structure and using more precise language to convey their ideas.

The essay presents a clear stance on the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people, with the writer providing specific reasons and examples to support their argument. However, the essay has several areas that require improvement to enhance its overall quality.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal experiences and anecdotes to illustrate their points. The example of the writer's grand aunt is a good way to show the contrast between the vitality of young people and the limitations of older individuals. The writer also attempts to explain the physiological and psychological factors that contribute to the differences in enjoyment between young and old people.

However, there are several areas where the essay falls short. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar need improvement. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""have great verve and energy"" (should be ""have great energy and verve""), ""inhabitant of our street"" (should be ""a resident of our street""), and ""undestand"" (should be ""understand""). Additionally, the writer uses colloquial expressions like ""most hilarious manner"" and ""lethagic"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

Furthermore, the writer's arguments could be more nuanced and balanced. While it is true that young people may have more energy and a more optimistic attitude, it is also possible that older people have a different perspective on life and may find joy in different activities. The writer's portrayal of older people as being ""lethagic"" and ""disgruntled"" is overly negative and does not provide a complete picture.

Finally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While the example of the grand aunt is a good start, it would be helpful to include more examples or research to demonstrate the physiological and psychological differences between young and old people.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with two main points to support their argument. The writer has effectively used specific examples, such as Einstein's Relativity Theory, to illustrate their points. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs. For instance, the writer uses the phrase ""There are two major points related with this isue"" to introduce the second point, and ""In fact, the current education system in most of the countries in the world is so"" to provide evidence for the second point. This shows a good attempt to organize the essay and make it flow smoothly.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their points. For example, when discussing the interconnectedness of scientific fields, they could have provided more examples of how different subjects are related. Secondly, the writer could have provided a clearer conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis statement. The current conclusion is somewhat vague and does not provide a strong final thought.

Additionally, there are some grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""We are living in an age of information, where the human knowledge of its surroundings has boosted and continues to accelerate even more rapidly"" could be rephrased to ""We are living in an age of information, where human knowledge of our surroundings has increased and continues to accelerate rapidly."" The use of ""its"" instead of ""our"" is incorrect, and ""boosted"" is not the best choice of word.

2.  The writer relies heavily on general statements and assumptions, such as ""young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be"" and ""young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable.""

The essay is well-structured, with each point logically connected to the previous one. The student has also attempted to use examples and explanations to justify their arguments.

However, there are areas that require improvement. Firstly, the language used is sometimes simplistic and lacks variety, which may make the essay seem less engaging. For instance, the phrase ""I fully agree to that statement"" could be rephrased to ""I strongly agree with the statement"" for a more polished tone. Additionally, some sentences are worded in a way that makes them difficult to understand, such as ""the hunger for success grows with the success one has."" A more precise expression would be ""the desire for further success increases as one achieves more.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more concrete examples to support their arguments. While the idea of a person having a ""risky character"" is mentioned, it is not clearly defined or illustrated with a specific example. The student also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""there has to be more than the already achieved"" without providing concrete evidence to back up this claim.

Lastly, the conclusion could be more effectively linked to the body paragraphs. The student states that the arguments show ""why success on a high level is not possible without risks at a high level,"" but this conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the previous points.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions, such as ""very nice thing,"" ""so much fun,"" and ""much cheeper."" While these phrases convey the student's intended meaning, they lack sophistication and nuance, which are essential for effective communication in writing.

In terms of content, the student provides some relevant examples to support their argument, such as the scenario in Paris where a guide can assist with language barriers. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence or specific details to reinforce their claims. For instance, the statement ""it would save you alot of monye"" is vague and lacks concrete data or statistics to support the claim that traveling with a group is cheaper.

Additionally, the student's organization and coherence are somewhat lacking.

For instance, ""And even Advertisments hide the lack of quality of ther products"" should be ""And even advertisements hide the lack of quality of their products.""

They have provided three main reasons to support their argument: the importance of studying, the need for gradual success through hard work, and the significance of building trust from others. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, ""Fist of all"" should be ""First of all,"" and ""an insurrance"" should be ""an insurance."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Similarly, their argument about the importance of trust from others is not well-developed, and they do not provide sufficient evidence to support the idea that taking risks is the worst way to build trust.

Thirdly, the student's writing style is often simplistic and lacks variety. They rely heavily on short, simple sentences, which can make the text feel flat and unengaging. Additionally, they do not use transitional phrases or words to connect their ideas, making the essay feel disjointed at times.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The writer provides some valid points to support their argument, such as the idea that young people have fewer worries and can appreciate the present moment more easily. However, the essay also contains several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

One of the main problems is the lack of clear organization and coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the transition from the idea that young people have fewer worries to the concept of appreciating the present moment is not smooth. Additionally, the writer often uses vague phrases such as ""in that respect"" and ""in an unsatisfied situation,"" which do not provide clear context.

Another issue is the use of grammatical errors and incorrect sentence structures. For example, ""Especially when they are very young they dont have much to worry about"" should be ""Especially when they are very young, they don't have much to worry about."" The writer also uses incorrect verb tenses, such as ""has been taking care of"" instead of ""is taken care of.""

The writer also relies heavily on clichés and overused expressions, such as ""You don't know that sugar is worth unless you have tasted salt."" While this phrase is meant to illustrate a point, it is not original and does not add much to the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points. The statement ""I cannot agree or disagree with the statement as a whole"" is confusing, as it contradicts the rest of the essay, which presents arguments for and against the statement.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts. However, the essay is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. 

The student has provided three main reasons to support their disagreement with the statement: the potential for incorrect concepts, the possibility of harmful ideas, and the need for students to develop their own ideas for future leadership roles. While these points are relevant to the topic, they are not fully developed and lack concrete examples to support their claims.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of cohesion and coherence between paragraphs. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the potential for incorrect concepts to the example of the shape of the Earth, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. Similarly, the transition to the example of the tribe members coming back after death is abrupt and lacks a clear link to the previous point.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words such as ""derictory,"" ""opservation,"" and ""relibilty"" being used incorrectly or inappropriately. The student also struggles with sentence structure, often using simple sentences that lack variety and interest.

Despite these issues, the student has demonstrated some understanding of the topic and has attempted to provide supporting examples. However, the writing is not polished, and the ideas are not fully developed.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer expressing their disagreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides two main reasons to support their argument: the excessive use of computers and the lack of seriousness in school. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The writer attempts to use specific examples, such as the use of computers and the importance of history and geography lessons, to support their argument.
- The writer tries to engage the reader with a metaphor, comparing young people to diamonds that need to be shaped.
- The writer attempts to address the issue of family responsibility, suggesting that parents also have a role in shaping their children's behavior.

However, there are several areas for improvement:

- The essay lacks coherence and clarity, with abrupt transitions between ideas and sentences that are not well-connected.
- The writer struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which can make the text difficult to understand.
- The writer does not provide concrete evidence or statistics to support their claims, relying on general statements and examples.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three reasons to support their agreement with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some sections. For instance, the transition between the introduction and the first reason is abrupt, and the connection between the reasons is not explicitly stated. The student jumps between different ideas without providing a clear link between them.

Secondly, the student's use of examples is not always effective in supporting their arguments. The anecdote about the beach incident is a good start, but it is not fully developed, and the connection to the first reason is not clear. The example about the friend's grandparents is also not well-integrated into the essay, and the student could have explored this idea further.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance in their analysis. The reasons provided are not thoroughly explained, and the student relies on general statements rather than specific evidence. For example, the statement ""old people has bad health to enjoy their life"" is not supported by any concrete evidence, and the student could have explored the complexities of aging and health more thoroughly.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat confusing, as they seem to contradict themselves by stating that ""enjoy life when we are young, and enjoy more quieter and relaxing life is better for elders."" This suggests that the student is not entirely convinced by their own argument, and the conclusion could be more effectively linked to the body paragraphs.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The student's opinion on the topic is well-supported with various reasons and examples, which is a significant strength of the essay. 

One of the notable aspects of the essay is the student's ability to identify both the advantages and disadvantages of trying new things, which shows a balanced perspective on the topic. The student has also provided specific examples to support their arguments, such as the risk of failure and the importance of staying competitive in a modernizing world.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""i think"" instead of ""I think,"" ""as well as getting things better and more efficent"" instead of ""more efficient,"" and ""it has its advantages and its disadvantages"" instead of ""it has both advantages and disadvantages."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, some of the student's sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, ""Always a person, who stops or slow down his pace in researching and working hard, will be thrown out of the competion"" could be rephrased as ""If a person stops or slows down their pace in researching and working hard, they will be left behind in the competition.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. While the student mentions the risk of failure, they could elaborate on specific scenarios or case studies to illustrate this point.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, effectively expressing their opinion through a series of connected ideas. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student has provided relevant examples from science to support their argument, showcasing an attempt to engage with the topic.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writing is often simplistic, with a lack of complex vocabulary and sentence structures. The student relies heavily on basic sentence patterns and fails to provide nuanced explanations. Additionally, some sentences are grammatically incorrect, such as ""It will fly and never stable in mind without it"" and ""They have to know reasons, factors, consequences and developments about the facts."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more varied and sophisticated examples to support their argument. The reliance on a single example from science limits the depth and breadth of their discussion. Moreover, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors and typos, which hinder the reader's understanding of the content. For instance, ""when the product is new to markets they have to Advertise it"" should be ""when a product is new to the market, it has to be advertised."" Similarly, ""All the popular brands in the world are  investing the one quarter of their money  in the  adds"" should be ""All popular brands in the world invest one quarter of their money in advertisements.""

Furthermore, the student's arguments are not well-supported and lack concrete evidence. While they mention that advertisements are necessary for products to be recognized, they fail to provide sufficient examples to back up this claim. The anecdote about the Daewoo Motors Matiz car is a good attempt, but it is not effectively linked to the main argument.

The student also struggles to address the counterargument, which is a crucial aspect of a well-structured essay. They acknowledge that some products may not be good, but they do not provide a convincing explanation of how this affects the overall effectiveness of advertisements.

The essay also lacks a clear conclusion, which is essential for summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The final sentence, ""Wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it on.lAll the above reasons shows that one can buy only when they know about the product this can be done by Advertisements,"" is unclear and does not effectively conclude the essay.

Evaluation: 

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the argument. 

The first point, regarding the lack of real-life conditions in advertisements, is a valid concern. The student provides a specific example of a bike advertisement, which is a good attempt to illustrate the issue. However, the explanation could be more detailed and nuanced. For instance, the student could have discussed how advertisers often use idealized settings, models, or scenarios to showcase products, which can create unrealistic expectations.

The second point, about companies intentionally making good advertisements to differentiate their products, is also a common criticism of advertising. The student provides examples of laptop companies, which is a good start. However, the explanation could be more sophisticated, exploring the concept of branding and how it relates to the perceived value of a product. Additionally, the student could have discussed how this tactic can lead to consumer dissatisfaction when the product fails to meet expectations.

The student's writing is generally clear, but there are some areas for improvement. The sentence structure is simple, and the vocabulary is not particularly varied. The student could benefit from using more complex sentence structures and a wider range of vocabulary to convey their ideas more effectively.

The conclusion is brief and somewhat repetitive, restating the main point without adding much new insight. The student could have ended with a more thought-provoking comment or a call to action, leaving the reader with something to consider.

They have effectively used examples from their personal experience as a businessman to illustrate the importance of trying new things and taking risks. The student has also acknowledged the potential advantages of sticking to what they know, but convincingly argues that the benefits of taking risks outweigh these advantages.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing is generally clear, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall coherence of the essay. For example, the sentence ""I am a businessman working at an investment bank and am required various skills from my customer in the diffrent sectors"" could be rephrased to ""As a businessman working at an investment bank, I am required to possess various skills to cater to different sectors."" Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion feels somewhat repetitive, as they reiterate their primary consideration for success, which is to expand their experiences and diversify their skills. A more effective conclusion would summarize the main points made in the essay and reiterate the thesis statement in a more concise manner.

One of the major issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical and spelling errors.

The student provides specific examples and reasons to support their argument, which is a significant strength.

One of the notable aspects of the essay is the student's ability to think critically about the benefits of community work. They effectively argue that community work has both direct and indirect benefits for the community, such as saving resources and preventing petty crimes. Additionally, the student highlights the personal benefits of community work, citing their own experience of gaining new perspectives and insights from interacting with elderly and disabled individuals.

Strengths:

1.  The student provides personal anecdotes to support their argument, making their writing more engaging and relatable. For instance, the story about their father teaching them about the formation of water around a glass of cold water is a great example of how having broad knowledge can be beneficial in everyday life.
2.  The student offers practical examples to illustrate their points, such as the potential job opportunities available with a broad range of subjects. This shows that they have thought about the real-world implications of their argument.
3.  The student acknowledges the possibility of specializing in a subject later, which demonstrates an understanding of the potential benefits of both broad and specialized knowledge.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, the phrase ""I will be able to educate my children better"" could be rephrased to ""Having broad knowledge will enable me to provide my children with a more comprehensive education.""
2.  Some of the sentences are quite short and lack supporting evidence. For instance, the statement ""People say there is no end to learning"" could be developed further to explain why this is relevant to the argument.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use examples to support their argument. They suggest that the increasing number of people and the need for more efficient transportation could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road. Additionally, the student proposes alternative modes of transportation, such as buses and trains, which could reduce traffic and pollution.

However, the essay is weakened by several areas of improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""In twenty years coming  all the cars and vehicals will get less than todays"" is unclear and lacks proper verb tense consistency. Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""diffecult"" and ""benifit"" being used incorrectly.

The student also struggles to organize their ideas coherently, often jumping between unrelated topics.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the importance of connections between different academic subjects. They provide a good example of how math is necessary for understanding accounting, which shows that they have thought about the relationships between subjects. Additionally, they mention the benefits of having broad knowledge, such as being able to understand newspaper articles and participate in discussions.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, which makes the text feel disjointed at times.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not entirely clear.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and misuse of articles. For instance, in the first sentence, ""It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel that by a tour guide"" should be ""It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel as compared to traveling with a tour guide."" Additionally, the student often uses incorrect verb tenses, such as using the present perfect tense inappropriately (e.g., ""I went to the opposit direction to the park that I had planned to go"").

Secondly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing safety to time-saving, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For example, the sentence ""For these reasons, traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of sager"" seems disconnected from the previous paragraph.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is limited and could be more effective. While the anecdote about getting lost in Hong Kong is a good attempt, it is not well-integrated into the essay and could be more effectively used to support the argument. The reference to the research conducted by the Labor of Korea in 2007 is also not properly cited, and the information is not fully explained.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide examples from various fields, including literature, film, and music. The examples are relevant to the topic and help to illustrate the point being made. For instance, the comparison between Beatrix Potter's determination to pursue her idea despite her father's disapproval and Mozart's creation of symphonies at a young age demonstrates the importance of taking risks and trying new things.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. The student's opening sentence, ""Everyone has one day dreamt of inventing something new which would make him rich and successful,"" is a good starting point, but it could be more specific and focused. A clearer thesis statement would help to guide the reader through the essay and provide a clearer direction for the argument.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""I must say I believe in people's intelligence"" and ""it is not interessant to rely on what someone else crated for us"" are not grammatically correct and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the motivation of trying new things to the importance of not relying on others' creations. A clearer connection between these ideas would help to create a more cohesive and logical argument.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective. The statement ""everyone should try new things"" is a good summary of the main point, but it could be more impactful if it were supported by a stronger final thought or a call to action.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two reasons to support their agreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""tend to do the thing which is not familliar with them,"" ""I had never been to musiums,"" and ""I did well because I know what the client want to for our products."" These errors detract from the clarity and coherence of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, resulting in abrupt shifts between ideas. For instance, the transition from the first reason to the second reason is abrupt, and the student fails to provide a clear link between the two ideas.

Thirdly, the student's examples, although attempting to support their argument, lack depth and specificity. The examples are brief and do not provide sufficient context, making it difficult to fully understand the significance of the student's experiences.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The student reiterates their agreement with the statement without providing a final thought or reflection on the importance of trying new things and taking risks.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that traveling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. 

Strengths:

1. The student provides three valid reasons for their opinion, including overcoming difficulties in a foreign country, safety concerns, and relaxation.
2. They use personal experience to support their argument, which adds credibility to their writing.
3. The student attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""First of all,"" ""Second reason,"" and ""In short.""

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and logical flow, with abrupt transitions between ideas and sentences.
2. Grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors are prevalent throughout the essay, which detracts from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.
3. The student relies heavily on simplistic sentence structures and repetitive phrases, such as ""you will face some difficulties,"" which makes the writing seem immature.
4. The essay could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to support the reasons provided.
5. The student's writing lacks variety in vocabulary, with many sentences using similar phrases and word choices.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Revise the essay to improve coherence and logical flow by using transitional phrases and sentences that connect ideas more smoothly.
2. Edit the essay for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors to enhance clarity and professionalism.
3. Vary sentence structures and vocabulary to create more engaging and mature writing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively disagreeing with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. They provide personal experiences and examples to support their opinion, which is a crucial aspect of essay writing for second language learners. However, there are areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases and connect their ideas logically. For instance, they use ""With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see"" to transition from the idea of independence to the negative consequences of traveling with a tour guide. Additionally, they use specific examples from their school trip to illustrate their point, which adds credibility to their argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion"" (should be ""put forward"" and ""have had experiences""). Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic, with a lack of variety in sentence length and complexity. For example, the sentence ""The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit"" could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""desicion"" (should be ""decision"") and ""localite"" (should be ""local resident"" or ""local people"") appearing throughout the essay. While the student attempts to use examples from their personal experience, the writing could benefit from more nuanced analysis and reflection.

Lastly, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt, with the student simply stating that they took their decision based on personal experience without summarizing their main points or reiterating their thesis statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured with three main reasons provided to support the argument. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide personal anecdotes, such as the example of starting cheerleading in high school, which effectively illustrates the benefits of taking risks. This shows that the student can think critically and connect their personal experiences to the topic.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the student often uses simple sentence structures and lacks variety in sentence length, which can make the essay feel a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""I think the bigger the risk is the bigger the chance you have. And to make that chance your own you will need hard work and that will make you a strong person"" could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with words like ""bigger"" and ""oprotunity"" being used incorrectly. The student also struggles with verb tenses, using ""takes"" and ""trying"" in the same sentence, which can be confusing.

Lastly, the student could benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their arguments. While the example of starting cheerleading is a good start, it would be more effective if the student provided more specific details about how this experience helped them become a stronger person.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided some relevant reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that need improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided three clear reasons to support their opinion, which are: the marketing technique of advertisements, varying expectations of people, and the influence of professional techniques on emotions. These reasons are well-linked to the topic and provide a clear structure to the essay.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. For example, the first paragraph introduces the topic and provides a clear thesis statement, but the second paragraph jumps abruptly to the first reason without a clear connection. Similarly, the third paragraph seems to be a repetition of the first paragraph and does not add any new information.

In terms of grammar and vocabulary, the student has made several errors, such as ""the the fact that"", ""adverisement-officies"", ""emphesized"", ""becasue"", and ""thing whic"". These errors make the essay difficult to understand and detract from the student's overall message.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their reasons. For example, in the second paragraph, the student mentions that people have different expectations from a product, but does not provide any concrete examples to illustrate this point.

Finally, the student could have concluded the essay more effectively by summarizing their main points and reiterating their thesis statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. They have effectively used examples from their personal experience and provided a logical explanation of how understanding ideas and concepts is linked to learning facts. The student has also shown an ability to think critically and provide a balanced view, acknowledging that both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are important.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their argument, particularly in the example about Einstein's concept of relativity. Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar. For instance, the sentence ""What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures? What is he supposed to remember?"" could be rephrased to make it more concise and focused.

The student has also shown some difficulty with sentence structure and word choice, particularly in the first paragraph. For example, the sentence ""Teaching, learning, studying: it's all a method!"" could be rephrased to make it more relevant to the topic. Furthermore, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given statement, and their essay demonstrates some understanding of the topic. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. The student jumps from discussing the limitations of traveling with a tour guide to the benefits of getting information from a guide. A more logical connection between the ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For example, ""Frankly speaking"" is an idiomatic expression that is not used correctly in this context. The student also uses ""neither"" incorrectly in the first paragraph. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, such as ""you don't neither"" and ""exiciting amusement park."" 

Thirdly, the student's arguments could be more convincing if they provided more specific examples and supporting evidence. For instance, they mention that traveling with a tour guide is easier to get information, but they do not provide any concrete examples to back up this claim. Similarly, when discussing the importance of interacting with native people, they mention that there is less free time in a tour, but they do not elaborate on how this affects the traveler's experience.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They seem to be saying that traveling with a tour guide is not the best way to travel, but they do not provide a clear alternative or a final thought to leave the reader with.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its overall effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""wether"" should be ""whether,"" ""agrare"" should be ""agree,"" ""has"" should be ""have,"" and ""examlpe"" should be ""example."" These errors detract from the student's message and make it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Furthermore, the student's organization and coherence are lacking. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of being young to the disadvantages, and then shifts to a personal anecdote that seems unrelated to the main topic. The student also fails to provide a clear thesis statement, making it challenging to understand their stance on the issue.

In terms of content, the student raises some valid points about the challenges faced by young people, such as financial constraints and pressure to achieve their goals. However, they also make some sweeping generalizations, such as stating that older people have ""alot of relationships"" and ""financial independence."" These statements are not supported by evidence and oversimplify the complexities of life.

The student's use of examples is also limited and often unclear. For instance, the example of a young couple wanting to take a vacation but being unable to do so due to financial constraints is not well-developed. The student could have explored this example further to make it more convincing.

Finally, the student's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of their main points. They also seem to contradict themselves by stating that they enjoyed their life when they were young but now feel that life is worth living.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the purpose of advertisements and how they can be misleading. The student has also provided some relevant examples, such as the use of sound effects and bright colors to attract young children, and the focus on profit over quality and customer service.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""realy"" instead of ""really,"" ""appeling"" instead of ""appealing,"" and ""exadurate"" instead of ""exaggerate."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be more developed and supported with concrete evidence. For instance, the statement ""Advertising is the best way to minpulate with young children's minds"" is a sweeping claim that requires more explanation and evidence to be convincing. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples of false advertisements and their effects on consumers.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. They provide examples from various subjects, including technology, mathematics, and philosophy, to support their argument. However, the essay is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which hinder the clarity and coherence of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide concrete examples to illustrate their points. For instance, the explanation of why aluminum is used in the construction of airplane skeletons is a good example of how understanding concepts can lead to a deeper understanding of facts. Similarly, the discussion of marriage in the context of philosophy is a good illustration of how concepts and ideas are essential in understanding the significance of facts.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The transitions between paragraphs are not always smooth, and the student jumps abruptly from one idea to another. Additionally, the writing is often plagued by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the topics. For example, in the discussion of mathematics, the student simply states that understanding concepts is necessary for solving problems, without providing a more detailed explanation of how this works. Similarly, the discussion of philosophy is somewhat superficial, and the student could have explored the topic more deeply.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given topic, providing two reasons to support their disagreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. It would be beneficial for the student to rephrase the introduction to include a more direct statement of their opinion and a preview of the reasons that will be discussed. 

In the first reason, the student mentions that in a group tour, they cannot visit places freely and provides a personal anecdote to support this claim. However, the sentence structure and vocabulary used are not always clear, which makes it difficult to understand the student's point. For example, the sentence ""If the place you want to visit is not very popular, there are a few plans you can choose"" could be rephrased to ""If you want to visit a less popular place, you may not have many options in a group tour."" 

The second reason is more coherent, but the student's writing still suffers from grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. For instance, the sentence ""You wouldn't be able to understand the history of the place if the time for sightseeing is limited"" could be rephrased to ""If you don't have enough time to explore a place, you may not be able to understand its history."" 

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. The use of simple sentences and short paragraphs makes the essay feel a bit flat and lacks depth. 

Finally, the student's conclusion is missing, which is an essential part of an essay. A conclusion should summarize the main points and reiterate the thesis statement.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a clear thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, stating that ideas are more important than facts.
2.  They have attempted to support their argument with examples, such as the use of music in medical rooms to illustrate the idea that music calms people.
3.  The student has demonstrated some ability to think critically and make connections between ideas, as seen in their example about the importance of music in the world.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow their argument.
2.  The writing is often simplistic and lacks depth. The student relies heavily on basic sentence structures and does not use more complex vocabulary or sentence varieties.
3.  There are several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of articles.
4.  The student does not fully address the counterargument or provide a nuanced discussion of the topic. Their argument is largely one-sided and lacks evidence to support their claims.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their opinion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. The essay is well-structured, with two main points presented to support the argument. 

The first point highlights the significance of understanding definitions and concepts in problem-solving, using a relevant example of mathematical theorems and basic arithmetic operations. This example effectively illustrates the importance of grasping fundamental concepts to apply them in practical situations.

The second point emphasizes the value of seeking reasons and understanding the underlying principles behind facts. The student uses a thought-provoking phrase, ""We would expose undiscovered things only when we don't limit ourselves with the given facts,"" to convey the idea that exploring beyond the surface level is essential for growth and discovery.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more varied sentence structures to enhance clarity and engagement. Additionally, some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as ""First, student must learn  what it is  meaning"" and ""I think, to do something important we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever.""

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides relevant examples from the medical field, such as cardiologists and neurologists, to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the importance of general knowledge while also highlighting its limitations. They recognize that general knowledge can be superficial and may not be sufficient to solve complex problems in specific subjects. The example of taxonomists and biophysicists is a good illustration of this point.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of their examples. For instance, they could have elaborated on how the principles of mathematics are applied to biology, or how specialists in different fields interact with each other. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to specific subject."" A more idiomatic expression would be ""We should focus our brains on solving problems related to a specific subject.""

Furthermore, the student could have addressed potential counterarguments more effectively. While they acknowledge the value of general knowledge, they could have also considered the potential benefits of having broad knowledge, such as being able to make connections between different subjects or approaching problems from a unique perspective.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the change in young people's attitudes to explaining their busy schedules. To improve this, the student should use transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate.

Additionally, ""these works were for young people and they did it without hesitation"" should be ""these tasks were for young people and they did it without hesitation"" to correct the subject-verb agreement.

Thirdly, the student's examples and supporting evidence are not always relevant or convincing. While it is true that students in Korea may have busy schedules, this is not a universal truth and may not be applicable to all young people. Furthermore, the student's statement that parents do not want their children to help their communities because they want them to focus on their future university studies is a generalization and may not be accurate for all families.

However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""There are a lot of people like to travel as a group. Maybe because there are going to a new place and no one no about it, then they decide to have tour guide"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Additionally, the transition between paragraphs is not smooth, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the essay.

For instance, the student could have provided more information about how companies like Apple or Google innovated and took risks to become successful, or how a baseball team's strategy changed after introducing a new player with a unique skillset.

Thirdly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The student could have rephrased the conclusion to include a more nuanced discussion of the risks and benefits of trying new things and taking risks.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. The writer has effectively used specific reasons and examples to justify their stance on the statement, making it easier for the reader to follow their argument.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a clear thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, stating their agreement with the statement in general terms. This sets the tone for the rest of the essay and helps the reader understand the writer's perspective.
2.  The writer has used specific examples from their home country, Spain, to support their argument. This adds depth and context to their opinion, making it more relatable and engaging.
3.  The student has identified two main factors contributing to the decline in community involvement among young people in Spain: the improvement in the quality of life of middle-class families and the reduction in family size. These factors are well-explained and supported with historical context.
4.  The writer has acknowledged the potential exceptions to their argument, showing an awareness of the complexity of the issue and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from a clearer and more concise introduction. The first sentence is a bit vague, and the writer could have provided a more direct transition to the thesis statement.
2.  Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, ""Focusing In my home country, Spain, I must say that I do agree in general terms with the statement proposed"" should be ""Focusing on my home country, Spain, I must say that I agree in general terms with the statement proposed.""
3.  The writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While the two factors mentioned are relevant, additional examples or statistics would strengthen their argument.
4.  The conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

Evaluation:

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given prompt, providing specific reasons and examples to support their stance. However, there are several areas where the student's writing can be improved.

Firstly, the student's introduction is somewhat unclear and lacks a strong thesis statement. The sentence ""The knowledge about the various academic subjects is good for every person because we can familiar with all the subjects and we can share our ideas with all kinds of people, who came from different background"" is a good starting point, but it does not directly address the prompt. A more effective introduction would have clearly stated the student's opinion and provided a roadmap for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""we can familier with all the subjects"" (should be ""familiar""), ""go throw the deeper levels of the subject"" (should be ""go through""), and ""When I was in btech"" (should be ""When I was in B.Tech""). These errors can make it difficult for the reader to understand the student's intended meaning.

Thirdly, the student's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For example, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of specialization to sharing a personal anecdote.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat weak, failing to summarize the main points made in the essay and reiterate their opinion. A stronger conclusion would have provided a more satisfying ending to the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The essay provides some relevant examples and reasons to support the argument, but there are areas that require improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, vocabulary, and organization.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to provide personal anecdotes and examples from their own life, such as the stories of successful people like Adison and Nobel, which shows an effort to connect the topic to their own experiences.
2. The student has identified two main reasons to support their argument: trying new things and taking risks, which are relevant to the topic.
3. The student has attempted to explain the benefits of taking risks, such as the potential for fame and financial gain, as well as the importance of preparing for potential negative outcomes.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and sentences that seem disconnected and lacking in coherence.
2. The student has used simple and basic vocabulary, which limits their ability to express complex ideas and nuances.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has made an effort to address both sides of the argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples and statistics to support their claims. For instance, the mention of unemployment among young people in European countries and the impact of globalization on job markets is a good example of how the writer has done their research. Additionally, the writer has provided a clear and concise explanation of the differences in lifestyle between young and older people, highlighting the opportunities and privileges that young people have today that older generations did not have.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets out the writer's main argument. While the writer does provide a clear answer to the question, it is not explicitly stated in the introduction. Secondly, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""When older people who either have the will to work but don't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets, hanging out, doing nothing (except skateboarding, listening to music, playing computer games and shopping) they might get the impression, that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age"" could be broken up into two or three shorter sentences for better clarity.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors and typos throughout the essay, such as ""hughe"" instead of ""huge"", ""multinatinal"" instead of ""multinational"", and ""probabaly"" instead of ""probably"". While these errors do not detract from the writer's overall argument, they do affect the overall impression of the essay.

Finally, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and balanced arguments. While the writer does acknowledge that older people are also affected by job cuts and economic changes, the essay could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the challenges faced by older people and how they compare to those faced by young people.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument, such as mentioning the opportunities available to older people to maintain a reactive body and mind. Additionally, the student has shown a good attempt to provide a nuanced view by acknowledging that times have changed and that older people can also enjoy life.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""tipical"" instead of ""typical"", ""studing"" instead of ""studying"", and ""sed compered"" instead of ""seem compared"". These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""our society probably"" and ""I think that this shows the change now expained"" being unclear and awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the student's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, with abrupt changes in topic and tone.

In terms of content, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the statement, rather than simply stating their opinion. For example, they could have explored the reasons why young people are often seen as more spontaneous and carefree, and how this perception has changed over time.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has provided specific examples to support their arguments, which is a significant strength of the essay.

One of the notable strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the reasons why advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of products. The student mentions the current tough competition in the economy, the discrepancy between advertised and actual product quality, poor customer service, and the use of attractive visuals and famous people in advertisements. These reasons are well-supported with personal anecdotes, making the essay more engaging and relatable.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing is generally clear, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. For example, ""many times ads. fail to meet the spectations created when you finally get or check what  advertised"" could be rephrased as ""many times ads fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what was advertised."" Additionally, some sentences are worded in a way that makes them difficult to understand, such as ""most of the times you can not get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed explanations of their points. For example, when discussing the use of famous people in advertisements, the student could explain how this tactic is used to create a sense of credibility or trust with the audience.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided some thoughtful and relevant examples to support their arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided relevant examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has made an effort to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples from historical figures such as Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein to illustrate the point that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer has effectively used these examples to demonstrate how taking risks and exploring new ideas led to significant advancements in their respective fields.

However, there are some areas that need attention. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several instances of verb tense inconsistencies and incorrect word usage. For example, the sentence ""People who have succeded in their work try to to make new things and take risks"" should be ""People who have succeeded in their work try to make new things and take risks."" Additionally, the writer often uses simple sentences, which can make the text seem a bit flat.

Another area for improvement is the use of supporting evidence. While the writer mentions that successful people ""will always make an attempt to make new things and take risks,"" they could have provided more concrete examples to back up this claim. Furthermore, the writer could have explored the potential consequences of not taking risks, such as stagnation and a lack of innovation.

Finally, the writer could have provided a more nuanced discussion of the relationship between success and taking risks. While they argue that success is not the end point, they could have explored the idea that taking risks can sometimes lead to failure, and that successful people must be willing to learn from their mistakes.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. However, their essay lacks a clear and direct response to the prompt, instead meandering through various points that seem to support their stance.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating that learning is a big process and that it is essential to know about each and every subject, but this is not a direct response to the prompt. The essay then jumps to discussing the importance of learning various subjects in school and how it helps build self-confidence and skills.

The student attempts to provide some specific reasons and examples to support their answer, such as the idea that we implement all subjects in our lives and should have basic knowledge about them. However, these points are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence to support them. The student also mentions the importance of research work and the need for dedication and patience, but this seems to be a tangent and does not directly relate to the prompt.

The writing style is also a concern, with numerous grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, and a lack of coherence between paragraphs. The student uses phrases such as ""The more we learn much more is left out to learn"" and ""it is an endless process"" which are not clearly related to the prompt.

Despite these issues, the student shows some understanding of the topic and attempts to provide their opinion. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of language, which makes it difficult to follow and understand.

Strengths:

1.  The student has taken a clear stance on the topic, which is a crucial aspect of essay writing. They have also provided a well-structured introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The writer has used relevant examples to support their argument, such as the potential for tour guides to cheat or take advantage of tourists. This demonstrates their ability to think critically and engage with the topic.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the assertion of unity means the denial of freedom"" and ""relaxation being my defenition."" These errors can make the text difficult to follow and detract from the overall impact of the argument.
2.  Some of the sentences are worded awkwardly or contain unclear phrasing, such as ""it is especially ture when, with the guide of a tour guide, one cannot indulge himself in the freedom of choosing what travelling sites to visit or what time to start.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The essay is divided into logical paragraphs, each addressing a specific point in support of or against the statement. The student has also provided some relevant examples to support their arguments.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and present a nuanced view. They recognize that both young and old people can enjoy life, but in different ways. This shows a good understanding of the topic and the ability to think critically.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and more varied sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people, due to several reasons, which, in my opinion, are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources, such as enthusiasm"" could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence ""This means that people, once they become old, have all the necessary resources in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves, and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people"" could be broken down into two simpler sentences.

The student also uses some idiomatic expressions correctly, such as ""exploit their knowledge"" and ""collect the fruits of their lives,"" but could benefit from more consistent use of idiomatic language throughout the essay.

In terms of content, the student provides some good examples to support their arguments, such as the example of people remembering their first kiss rather than their last. However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to make the arguments more convincing.

They have provided three specific reasons to support their opinion: the use of visual aspects in advertisements, the exaggerated presentation of products in home shopping channels, and the emphasis on a product's prize and prestige in contests.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to use specific examples to support their arguments, such as the story about the clothes and the kimchi. However, the examples could be more detailed and elaborate to make the arguments more convincing.
2. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the topic and has attempted to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""visual aspects,"" ""densed,"" and ""yammy.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and organization, which makes it challenging to follow the student's argument. The writing is riddled with grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and awkward phrasing, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide examples to support their argument. The examples from the chemistry lab and nuclear experiments are relevant and help to illustrate the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. However, the explanations are not always clear, and the connections between the examples and the main argument are not well-established.

The student also attempts to address the potential consequences of not understanding ideas and concepts, such as accidents and explosions in the lab. However, these points are not fully developed, and the student could have provided more detailed explanations and supporting evidence to strengthen their argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance, and they rely heavily on simplistic statements and generalizations. For example, the statement ""without knowing the knowledge and details he do the experiment will give some bad conclusions"" is not a well-supported claim, and the student could have provided more evidence to back up this assertion.

In terms of language use, the student struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are numerous errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation, which make the text difficult to read and understand.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. Here are some specific areas of concern:

1.  **Grammar and Mechanics**: The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, ""people turns"" should be ""people turn,"" ""horess"" should be ""horses,"" and ""viecles"" should be ""vehicles."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the argument.

2.  **Vocabulary**: The student's vocabulary is limited, leading to the use of words like ""divlopment"" (development), ""discoviries"" (discoveries), and ""dissappear"" (disappear). While the student attempts to use more complex vocabulary, the incorrect spellings undermine their credibility.

3.  **Coherence and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The student jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow their argument. For example, the transition from discussing the discovery of new transportation methods to the current dominance of air transportation is abrupt.

4.  **Supporting Evidence**: While the student attempts to provide reasons for their argument, they lack concrete evidence to support their claims. The statement that ""every new generation"" will bring new ideas is a vague assertion that requires more substance.

5.  **Writing Style**: The essay's writing style is informal and lacks sophistication. The use of phrases like ""I dont think soo"" and ""therefor"" detract from the overall tone and make the essay seem less polished.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of specific and concrete examples to support the argument. The student has done a good job of providing details about the risks taken by Bill Gates and the managers of Starbucks, and how these risks led to success. The example of studying in the United States is also a good addition, as it shows how taking risks can lead to personal growth and new opportunities.

The ideas are not always well-connected, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, which can make them difficult to understand.

Another area for improvement is the use of evidence to support the argument. While the student mentions that the assumption is ""logical"" and ""supported by evidences,"" they do not provide any concrete evidence to back up this claim. Instead, they rely on anecdotal examples, which, while interesting, are not sufficient to make a strong argument.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided some relevant points to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to reference Oscar Wilde's quote and use it to support their argument. This shows that they have a good understanding of the topic and can use relevant examples to back up their claims. Additionally, the student has attempted to provide three main points to support their argument, which is a good structure for an essay.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's grammar and vocabulary are not always accurate. For example, the sentence ""Generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history"" should be ""Generally, people who are remembered are those who leave a trace of their life in history."" The student also uses incorrect verb tenses and sentence structures throughout the essay.

Secondly, the student's coherence and organization could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For example, the student states that ""people will recognise success only when it is visible"" but then jumps to the idea that ""success is also difference, uniqueness."" A clearer connection between these ideas would make the essay more cohesive.

Lastly, the student's use of examples and evidence is limited. While they reference Oscar Wilde's quote, they do not provide any other concrete examples to support their argument. This makes the essay feel somewhat one-dimensional and lacking in depth.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide reasons to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is clear, but it is phrased as a question, which may confuse the reader. A more direct statement, such as ""In my opinion, old people enjoy life more than young ones,"" would be more effective. 

The student provides two main reasons to support their opinion: the experience of old people and the worries of young people. The first reason is well-explained, with a clear example that illustrates the point. However, the second reason is somewhat unclear, and the example provided does not directly relate to the point being made. The student mentions that young people have many things to worry about, but the example given is about an old person's ability to focus on enjoyment, which does not directly address the point.

Furthermore, the student's writing contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""diffecult,"" ""do't,"" ""sane,"" and ""thei."" These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The statement ""every one has his own enjoyable"" is not a clear conclusion and does not provide a sense of closure.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given topic, with the writer agreeing that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides three main reasons to support their argument: the busy lives of young people, the decline of community connections, and the anonymity of modern neighborhoods. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The writer clearly states their opinion and provides a brief overview of the essay's structure.
- The writer attempts to use specific examples to support their arguments, such as the separation of time between studies, part-time jobs, and social activities.
- The writer also touches on the idea that people are no longer attached to one another and the anonymity of modern neighborhoods.

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, ""conditions of life has changed"" should be ""conditions of life have changed.""
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly or lack clarity, making it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning. For instance, ""its just like if they use the means of friendship and communication directly with others"" could be rephrased as ""they use technology to communicate directly with others.""
- The writer could provide more specific examples and details to support their arguments, making the essay more convincing and engaging.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do,"" and has provided several reasons to support their argument. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought at times. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, colloquial expressions, and a lack of formal tone, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, they mention that young people have fewer responsibilities and can ""seize the day,"" while older people are bogged down by work and worry about the future. The student also raises a valid point about middle-aged people having too many responsibilities, which can make their lives more stressful.

However, the essay is weakened by several issues. Firstly, the student's arguments are not always well-supported or logical. For example, they claim that young people enjoy life because they have nothing to think about, but then contradict themselves by stating that adolescents are often in a bad mood and complain frequently. This inconsistency undermines the student's argument.

Furthermore, the essay is plagued by grammatical errors, such as incomplete sentences, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""They used to know but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, the student's use of colloquial expressions, such as ""most of time for nothing,"" detract from the formal tone expected in an essay.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on organizing their ideas more clearly, providing more logical and well-supported arguments, and editing their work for grammatical errors and tone.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their opinion on the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" Their essay is well-structured, and they provide specific examples from various aspects of society, such as markets, TV commercials, and the fashion world, to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use vivid and relatable examples to illustrate their points. For instance, the comparison of the attractive packaging of food and beverages to the actual taste and nutritional value is a compelling argument. Similarly, the example of the fashion world, where models are presented as healthy and satisfied, but often struggle with eating disorders, is a powerful critique of the societal pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. For example, the phrase ""society of appearance"" is a good starting point, but it could be developed further to provide a more detailed analysis of the issue. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from providing more evidence to support their claims. While the examples provided are effective, they are not always backed up with concrete data or statistics. This would have added more credibility to their argument.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effectively linked to the introduction. The student starts by stating that the statement summarizes an important problem in society, but the conclusion does not explicitly tie back to this initial statement. A more explicit connection between the introduction and conclusion would have strengthened the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student has also provided personal experiences and examples to support their argument, which is a good practice for second language learners.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, ""as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the places in a particular place"" should be ""as tourists, we don't know much about the places in a particular place."" Additionally, ""we will visit only those places which are known to us"" should be ""we will only visit the places that we know.""

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""I was traveling with my friends and we all planned to hire for a tour"" should be ""I traveled with my friends and we all planned to hire a tour."" The student also uses repetitive language, such as ""I think"" and ""I was sure,"" which can make the writing seem less engaging.

In terms of content, the student's examples are mostly anecdotal and lack depth.

2. They have used specific examples to support their reasons, such as traveling to South Africa and Cuzco in Peru.
3. The student has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""On the one hand"" and ""The other reason.""

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear and concise introduction that sets the context for the topic. The first sentence is vague and does not provide a clear direction for the reader.
2. The student has used simple and basic vocabulary, which may not be suitable for a second language learner. For example, ""Human have created these sense of going out of home called travelling"" should be ""Humans have created the concept of traveling.""
3.

However, there are areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's language skills are not yet proficient, with several grammatical errors and incorrect verb tenses used throughout the essay. For instance, ""On the one hand I think young people enjoy life more than older people do"" should be ""On the one hand, I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do."" Additionally, ""They go to parties, spend much time with friends and have not much responsiblities"" should be ""They go to parties, spend much time with friends, and have few responsibilities.""

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""I think this is not an amusing thought"" could be rephrased as ""I think this is a rather depressing thought."" The student also lacks variety in sentence structure, often using simple sentences that could be combined or rephrased for better effect.

In terms of content, the student has provided some valid points, such as the fact that older people often have health problems and a sense of security, which can contribute to their enjoyment of life. However, the student's arguments are not always well-supported, and some points are not fully developed. For instance, the statement ""In contrast to that there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired"" could be expanded upon to provide more evidence.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that advertisements often exaggerate the qualities of products. The essay provides four main reasons to support this claim, including the focus on advantages over disadvantages, competition between companies, the selective nature of advertising, and the art of advertisement itself. 

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""First and the most important thing is that,"" which should be ""First and foremost,"" and ""ofcource"" which should be ""of course."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is sometimes simplistic, with a lack of variety in sentence length and complexity. For example, the sentence ""The film trailers and game trailers they are always made in a way so that people go watch this film or game after seeing the trailer but when they watch the film or buy the game they don't find them as they expected"" could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more concrete examples to support their claims. While the example of film and game trailers is a good start, it would be more effective if the student provided more specific details about how these trailers misrepresent the products. Additionally, the student could have explored the potential consequences of such misrepresentation, such as the impact on consumer trust and the economy.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples to support their argument. With further practice in writing and attention to detail, the student has the potential to produce high-quality essays.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is clear, but it contains a grammatical error (""most advertisements is better than the products itself""). A more accurate sentence would be ""I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."" This error sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

The student provides two main reasons to support their argument: the use of attractive models in advertisements and the high quality of advertisements. The first reason is well-explained, and the student provides a specific example from their personal experience with fashion magazines. However, the second reason is somewhat vague and relies on a general statement about companies competing in the market. A more concrete example or statistic would strengthen this point.

The student also uses a few grammatical errors, such as ""it's a fault"" (should be ""it's a flaw"") and ""people don't really need it"" (should be ""people don't really need them""). Additionally, the sentence ""A recent reserch shows that 90 percent companies in fashion field consider they should spend money and time to produce an advertisement"" contains a grammatical error and a lack of clarity.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and misuse of articles. For instance, the sentence ""I believe that is better the person specialize in one subjetc"" should be ""I believe that it is better for a person to specialize in one subject."" This kind of error is distracting and makes it challenging to follow the student's argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks coherence and logical flow. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing sports to academic subjects without providing a clear connection between the two. For example, the transition from ""If I want to learn to sports at the same time, I will learn but I can't develop all day in only one sport"" to ""We need have different observations about different subjetc or in this cause sport before to choose any one"" is unclear.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions and colloquialisms. For instance, ""We need study evrything to choose this subjets"" should be ""We need to study everything to choose the subjects that suit us best."" This lack of vocabulary variety makes the writing seem simplistic and unengaging.

However, the student does attempt to provide some supporting examples from their personal experience with sports, which shows a glimmer of understanding of the topic.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They have identified the impact of new technologies on young people's lives and the lack of community involvement. The student also suggests some potential solutions, such as offering attractive activities and promoting community engagement.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. The student's opinion is not clearly stated in the introduction, and the essay meanders between different ideas. The student also uses simplistic vocabulary and sentence structures, which makes the writing seem immature.

Furthermore, the student's use of grammar and punctuation is inconsistent. There are several spelling mistakes, and the student often fails to use articles, verb tenses, and prepositions correctly.

The sentence structure is often fragmented, and the use of transitional phrases is limited, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the first sentence, ""I have two opinions in the understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts by student as mention in the follow,"" is unclear and seems to be a repetition of the prompt. A more effective way to begin the essay would be to clearly state the student's opinion and provide a thesis statement.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""The under standing idea and concept has important role in understanding subject and get the the higher degree in exams"" should be rewritten as ""Understanding ideas and concepts play an important role in understanding the subject and achieving higher grades in exams."" This correction not only improves the sentence structure but also uses more precise vocabulary.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples to support their argument is limited. While they mention that ""most of the theoretical science and also practical science based upon ideas and concepts,"" they fail to provide concrete examples to illustrate this point. To strengthen their argument, the student could have provided specific examples of scientific theories or innovations that originated from ideas and concepts.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear summary of their main points. They suggest that educational members and societies should learn both ideas and concepts that are true and profitable, as well as facts approved by scientists and their experiments. However, this conclusion feels like an afterthought and does not effectively tie together the student's previous arguments.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher score. 

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a personal anecdote from their experience traveling with friends to support their argument, which is a good way to engage the reader and make the essay more relatable.
2.  They have attempted to use specific examples and details from their experience, such as the trip to New Delhi to visit the Taj Mahal, to support their claim.
3.  The student has touched upon the benefits of traveling in a group, including gaining more information about the place, reducing travel expenses, and strengthening relationships with friends.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's opinion is stated in the first sentence, but it could be more effectively introduced with a clear thesis statement.
2.  The writing is often informal, with grammatical errors and colloquial expressions, such as ""I just want to emphasise this by using an example of my travel with my friends"" and ""i.e. none of the books contained these details."" This can make the essay seem less polished and less convincing.
3.  The student could have provided more depth and analysis of the benefits of traveling in a group, rather than simply stating them. For example, they could have explored how the tour guide's expertise added value to their experience or how the group dynamic affected their learning.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, and a lack of precise vocabulary.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide examples to support their argument. The examples of scientists producing new inventions and the importance of taking risks for achievements are relevant and well-intentioned. However, the student fails to provide concrete evidence or specific examples to back up their claims, relying on general statements and vague phrases.

The student's writing also suffers from a lack of clarity and concision. Many sentences are worded awkwardly, and the use of phrases such as ""i.e., successful people"" and ""for every achivement"" detract from the overall coherence of the essay. Furthermore, the student's use of transitions between paragraphs is weak, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of their argument.

To improve, the student should focus on refining their writing skills, paying close attention to grammar, sentence structure, and vocabulary. They should also strive to provide more specific and concrete examples to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements. Additionally, the student should work on organizing their ideas more effectively, using transitional phrases to connect their paragraphs and ideas.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The writer has effectively used examples to support their argument, making it easier for the reader to follow their line of thinking. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples to illustrate their points. For instance, the explanation of how addition is taught to children is a great example of how understanding a concept can lead to a deeper comprehension of related facts. This example effectively supports the student's argument that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning a list of facts.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. At times, the writing can be a bit wordy and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For example, the sentence ""What i really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several facts of the same kind"" could be rephrased for clarity. Additionally, some of the sentences could be tightened up for better flow.

The student also shows a good understanding of the potential risks of focusing too much on ideas and concepts, such as the risk of losing touch with reality. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the topic and the ability to consider multiple perspectives.

In terms of grammar and vocabulary, the student has made some mistakes, such as ""he`ll"" instead of ""he will"" and ""effecive"" instead of ""effective"". However, these errors do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the essay.

Strengths:
- The student has attempted to use specific examples to support their opinion, such as helping friends and family members.
- The writer has shown an understanding of the importance of helping others, particularly in a university setting where students become like a family and help each other.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively agreeing with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of examples to support the argument. The student provides a hypothetical scenario where traveling in a foreign land without a tour guide would be challenging, which is a good way to engage the reader and make the argument more relatable. Additionally, the student highlights several benefits of traveling with a tour guide, such as meeting like-minded people, accessing exclusive places, and receiving valuable advice from the guide.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more nuanced and specific examples to support their argument. For instance, instead of simply stating that a tour guide can take you to places you might not have access to, they could have provided a specific example of a famous landmark or cultural site that they visited with a tour guide.

Secondly, the student could have addressed potential counterarguments more effectively. While they acknowledge that some people might disagree with the statement, they do not provide a thorough response to these counterarguments. For example, they could have addressed the potential drawbacks of traveling in a group, such as the loss of personal freedom or the risk of being stuck with a group of people who are not as interested in the destination as they are.

Lastly, the student could have improved the writing quality by using more precise vocabulary and grammar. For instance, the phrase ""most of the people would not agree with this statement"" is a bit vague, and the student could have used more specific language to express their ideas.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student begins by stating their agreement with the statement, but fails to provide a clear explanation or supporting evidence. The essay meanders through various points, including the financial struggles of young people, the pressure to work and study, and the student's personal experience. However, these points are not effectively linked together to form a cohesive argument.

The student attempts to use specific examples, such as their own experience of working to pay for studies and having to worry about bills and rent. However, these examples are not fully developed and lack concrete details. The student also uses vague phrases, such as ""the rhythm of life goes so fast,"" which do not add much depth to the argument.

The essay attempts to address the prompt by providing some reasons and examples to support the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization, which makes it challenging to follow the writer's argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot,"" ""speacking"" instead of ""speaking,"" ""exhusted"" instead of ""exhausted,"" and ""exsotic"" instead of ""exotic."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning.

In terms of content, the essay attempts to provide some valid points, such as the physical and mental differences between young and old people. For instance, the writer correctly notes that young people have more energy and stamina, which allows them to engage in various activities and try new things. Additionally, the writer highlights the emotional differences between the two age groups, stating that young people view life as a long trip with many opportunities, whereas older people are more concerned about death and losing their loved ones.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of these points. For example, the writer could have provided more specific examples of how young people's energy and stamina allow them to engage in various activities, or how older people's concerns about death and loss affect their daily lives. Furthermore, the writer could have explored the potential counterarguments to their claim, such as the fact that older people may have a deeper appreciation for life and a greater sense of wisdom.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing reasons and examples to support their agreement with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

One of the primary concerns is the lack of clear and concise writing. The student's writing is riddled with grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word usage (e.g., ""polute"" instead of ""pollute,"" ""ozon hall"" instead of ""ozone layer,"" and ""thier"" instead of ""their""). These errors make it challenging to understand the student's intended meaning and detract from the overall coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's arguments are not well-supported and lack concrete evidence. While they mention the negative impacts of cars on the environment and human health, they fail to provide specific statistics or examples to back up these claims. For instance, they state that cars contribute to air pollution, but they do not provide any data to illustrate the extent of this problem. Similarly, they mention that Americans are getting fatter due to relying on cars, but they do not offer any concrete evidence to support this assertion.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the environmental and health impacts of cars to mentioning the cost of car ownership. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion that ties together the various points made throughout the essay.

Finally, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. They rely on simplistic and overly broad statements, such as ""we have to walk our own legs"" and ""do not rely on car so much."" These statements do not provide a thoughtful or well-reasoned solution to the problem of car ownership.

These errors make it challenging to comprehend the student's intended message. Furthermore, the essay lacks proper sentence structure, with many sentences being fragmented or run-on.

In terms of content, the student attempts to provide specific reasons for why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer expressing disagreement. The writer provides two main reasons to support their argument: 

1. The writer believes that consumers are aware of the products they use and make informed decisions, citing the example of buying a car. However, this example could be more effective if it were more specific and detailed. For instance, the writer could have mentioned specific features of the car they were looking for and how they used various sources of information to make their decision.

2. The writer argues that advertisements are primarily used by companies to establish their leadership rather than influence customer choice. This point is supported by the example of multiple car companies offering similar products. However, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to strengthen this argument.

The writer also addresses a potential counterargument, suggesting that young people are influenced by advertising, but counters this by stating that they are not responsible for their purchases and rely on their parents. This response is somewhat simplistic and does not fully address the complexity of the issue.

The writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, with some minor errors in sentence structure and spelling. The writer also uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, which helps to improve the flow of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a nuanced perspective on the issue, acknowledging that young people's behavior can vary depending on the country and culture they live in. This is evident in the example of comparing Swedish and Spanish young people's attitudes towards community involvement. The student also shows self-awareness by stating that they themselves are not interested in communities, which adds a personal touch to the essay.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as some of the ideas seem disconnected. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""By the same token, young people focus on themselves and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activities instead of community services"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their argument. While the example of nationalistic movements in Europe is interesting, it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay. The student could have explored this idea further and explained how it relates to young people's attitudes towards community involvement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides two specific examples to support this claim: changing the color of a product's cover and changing its name to make it appear high-quality. These examples are relevant to the topic and are drawn from the student's personal experience in Turkey.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to use specific examples to support their argument, which is a key aspect of effective essay writing.
2. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the topic and has provided some relevant details from their personal experience.
3. The student has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""First of all"" and ""Secondly.""

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the sentence ""Generally faded colors will make the customer think that product is made with an old technology, whereas bright colors deceive the consumer that it is made by high technology"" could be more nuanced and detailed.
2. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g. ""In my opinon,"" ""that`s why many advertisers force manufacturers to produce bright looking pencils to increase selling"").
3. The student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Encourage the student to use more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas.
2. Suggest that the student provide more detailed and specific examples to support their claims.
3. Encourage the student to revise their conclusion to provide a clearer summary of the main points and a more effective conclusion.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support this claim, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to explain the underlying reasons behind the effectiveness of advertisements. The idea that advertisements tap into people's desire for social acceptance and approval is a valid point, and the example of David Beckham using a particular aftershave is a good illustration of this concept. Additionally, the student's suggestion that being aware of this fact can make people more critical of advertisements is a reasonable conclusion.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The opening sentence is a good starting point, but it could be more effective if it were more specific and focused. For example, ""While advertisements often make exaggerated claims about products, I believe that their primary goal is to tap into people's desire for social acceptance and approval.""

Another area for improvement is the organization and coherence of the essay. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the strategy used by market analysts to the example of David Beckham, and then to the conclusion. A more logical flow of ideas and transitions between paragraphs would make the essay easier to follow.

Furthermore, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For example, ""That is not an easy is question to answer"" should be ""That is not an easy question to answer,"" and ""I will try to make an example"" should be ""I will use an example.""

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and focused. The final sentence, ""This way of reasoning will make us more critics on advertisments, whose products will seem no more as attractive as we thought they were before,"" is a good start, but it could be more impactful if it were more clearly connected to the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some reasons and examples to support their opinion that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. However, the essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which makes it challenging to follow the student's line of thought. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use specific examples from their personal experience, such as the traffic problems in Italy and the difficulties of driving in big cities. These examples demonstrate the student's ability to think critically and connect their personal experiences to the topic.

However, the essay is marred by several weaknesses. Firstly, the student's writing is often unclear and lacks proper sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""In nowdays you can have and drive a car when you are fortheen,the youth don-t drive any more motorcicle,a little special car"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand. 

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions and incorrect spellings (e.g., ""apermitted,"" ""pubblic trasport""). This lack of vocabulary and grammatical accuracy makes the essay difficult to read and understand.

Lastly, the student's argument is not well-supported, and they fail to provide concrete evidence or data to back up their claims. For example, they state that ""perhaps in the future in each town there will be a metro station a good train and bus station,"" but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a personal anecdote and supporting their stance with examples from their own experience. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""To understand ideas and concept is not very easy but once you understand, to know the facts is easy job i think"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to comprehend. Similarly, the transition between ideas is not smooth, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought.

Moreover, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on colloquial expressions such as ""i think,"" ""i was embarasing,"" and ""from that point i decided to change."" While these expressions are common in informal writing, they are not suitable for academic writing. The student should aim to use more formal vocabulary to convey their ideas effectively.

In terms of content, the student provides a clear and relatable example from their personal experience, which supports their stance on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and analysis of the topic. The student could have explored the reasons why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, and provided more concrete examples to support their argument.

The student's conclusion is also somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of their main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples, such as the use of models with immaculate skin in skin care product advertisements, to support their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the purpose of advertising and the responsibility of the consumer to critically evaluate the information presented. The student also shows an understanding of the regulations surrounding advertising and the importance of truthfulness in advertisements.

However, there are some areas for improvement. At times, the student's writing can be a bit informal, with phrases such as ""Don't get me wrong"" and ""I'll conclude by attacking the other point of view."" While these phrases are not necessarily incorrect, they may not be suitable for a formal essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided two relevant examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, and the student has attempted to address the counterargument by mentioning the importance of self-control and goal-setting. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, subject-verb agreement issues, and misuse of articles. For instance, the sentence ""The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be splitted into two parts"" should be ""The discussion about the success of people according to the level of risk they take should be divided into two parts."" Additionally, the student often uses colloquial expressions and informal language, which detracts from the overall formality of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions to convey complex ideas. For example, the phrase ""people with a ability to try risks"" should be ""people who are willing to take risks."" Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the two examples, rather than simply presenting them as isolated anecdotes.

Thirdly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by presenting their opinion on the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. They have provided some valid points to support their argument, such as the need to be aware of various subjects like politics, ecology, communication, and business, which are essential in everyday life. The student also suggests that having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to choose a specific subject that aligns with their personality, skills, and motivation.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The student's opinion is somewhat ambiguous, and it is not immediately clear whether they agree or disagree with the statement. Additionally, the essay contains several grammatical errors, such as ""having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject, however,"" which should be ""However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject.""

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more specific examples and supporting details to strengthen their arguments. For instance, they mention that having a broad knowledge base allows individuals to express themselves better in their chosen subject, but they do not provide concrete evidence to support this claim. The student also uses some vague phrases, such as ""it seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subjects,"" which could be more effectively expressed as ""it is essential to be aware of a wide range of subjects in today's world.""

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized their opinion on the statement. Instead, the conclusion seems somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on whether young people enjoy life more than older people. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy, which makes it challenging to follow the student's arguments. 

One of the primary issues is the use of simplistic and repetitive sentence structures, which fails to convey the student's ideas effectively. For instance, the statement ""young people every time enjoy life more than older people"" is a direct repetition of the prompt and does not provide any substantial evidence to support the claim. 

The student attempts to provide reasons for their opinion by mentioning the activities young people engage in, such as sports, music, and cinema. However, these points are not well-developed and lack specific examples to illustrate their claims. For example, the statement ""young people very active, make alot of sports"" is a vague assertion that does not provide any concrete evidence to support the idea that young people are more active than older people.

The student also attempts to contrast young people with older people, stating that young people do not worry about life conditions, financial problems, and national economy. However, this point is not well-supported and appears to be a simplistic generalization. The student also makes a contradictory statement that young people are ""very powerfull"" but do not care about problems, which is unclear and confusing.

The conclusion is also marred by grammatical errors and simplistic language, which detracts from the student's overall argument. The statement ""being young people is very entertaining thing"" is a grammatically incorrect sentence that does not provide a clear conclusion to the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""The influnce of advertisements on the customers is worth commendable,"" which should be ""The influence of advertisements on customers is commendable."" Additionally, ""thier"" should be spelled as ""their,"" and ""exagerated"" should be spelled as ""exaggerated."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""projecting thier goods to the customers in a 'larger than real' manner"" being unclear and awkwardly phrased. The student could benefit from using more precise and varied vocabulary to convey their ideas.

In terms of coherence, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing washing powders and soaps to clothing, motor vehicles, and food items. A clearer transition between these ideas would improve the flow of the essay and make it easier to follow.

Despite these issues, the student does provide some relevant examples to support their opinion, such as the exaggerated claims made by advertisers about washing powders and soaps.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples, such as the travel arrangement company with dedicated guides, which helps to make the argument more convincing. Additionally, the student has attempted to use transitional phrases, such as ""Many reasons can be put forth"" and ""I would like to end the topic by stating,"" which shows some attempt at connecting ideas.

However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay lacks a clear introduction that sets up the argument and provides a thesis statement. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I agree to the statement"" (should be ""I agree with the statement""), ""he has been to the place earlier and knows a lot many things about the place"" (should be ""he has been to the place before and knows a lot about it""), and ""the best person who can make our visit exciting and helping us out in planning the trip with only a little monetary cost"" (should be ""the best person who can make our visit exciting and help us plan the trip at a relatively low cost"").

Furthermore, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For example, ""Often a guide is like a local friend helping us in staying at the best hotels at an economical price, eating the best food, visiting the best places"" could be simplified to ""A guide can be like a local friend, helping us find the best hotels, food, and places to visit at a reasonable price.""

These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning. They argue that learning facts is essential for understanding concepts, but they fail to provide a clear explanation of how this works. For instance, the example of learning history to understand the present is not convincing, as it oversimplifies the complexities of historical context. Additionally, the student's assertion that learning facts helps to avoid confusion is not adequately explained, and the example of learning about country damage during World War II is not a strong illustration of this point.

2. The student has provided some relevant examples to support their argument, such as the scenario of getting stuck in a marshland while trekking.
3. The student has attempted to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""unpredictable conditions,"" ""responsibility,"" and ""collaborative actions.""

Weaknesses:

1. The student's language accuracy is a major concern, with numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""There different attitudes toward taking tirp"" should be ""There are different attitudes towards taking trips.""
2. The student's sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, leading to a repetitive and monotonous tone.
3. The student's ideas are not always well-developed, and some points, such as the benefits of group travel, are not fully explored.
4. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic expressions, such as ""breathtaking and spectaculatr view"" instead of more descriptive language.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. The student should focus on improving their language accuracy by proofreading their work carefully and using a dictionary to check for spelling and grammar errors.
2. The student should aim to use more complex sentence structures and varied vocabulary to create a more engaging and dynamic tone.
3. The student should provide more detailed and specific examples to support their arguments, and fully develop their ideas to make them more convincing.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The writer's use of phrases such as ""Good and hard question"" and ""Immm. I think very bad sentences"" indicate a lack of confidence and self-awareness in their writing. The essay's structure is also disorganized, with ideas and sentences presented in a seemingly random order.

The writer attempts to provide reasons for their answer, citing the lack of money and the young people's preference for leisure activities as reasons why they do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, these points are not well-supported and lack concrete examples. The writer also introduces a confusing example about a student not working their lessons, which seems unrelated to the topic.

The writer's vocabulary is limited, with several instances of incorrect grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For example, ""this question`s answer is not yes or no"" should be ""I think the answer to this question is not a simple yes or no."" Additionally, ""young people's mind is is heavy"" should be ""young people's minds are heavy.""

The writer's tone is also somewhat inconsistent, veering between a casual, conversational tone and a more serious, critical tone.

3.  The student has demonstrated an understanding of the potential benefits of taking risks, including increased self-confidence and self-esteem.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks coherence and organization. The ideas are not well-connected, and the transitions between paragraphs are abrupt.
2.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between personal anecdotes and general statements without a clear logical flow. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal experiences to support the argument. The writer shares a relatable story about how they were able to recall information from their university days because they understood it, whereas they forgot verses from the Bible that they only memorized. This example effectively illustrates the importance of comprehension over memorization.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more concrete evidence and logical connections between ideas. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing their personal experiences to making a general statement about education. For instance, the sentence ""I think education today should focus more on explain things instead of just let student learn then"" could be supported with more specific examples or research to make the argument more convincing.

Additionally, there are some grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as ""informations"" instead of ""information,"" ""interresting"" instead of ""interesting,"" and ""knowlegde"" instead of ""knowledge."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, and a lack of precise vocabulary.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's reliance on vague statements and generalizations. For instance, the student claims that ""everybody know thinking about how we are going to substitute gas"" and ""cars rejects too much carbon into the atmosphere."" These statements lack concrete evidence and specific examples to support their claims.

The student attempts to provide some examples, such as the car-free zones in Paris and the restricted car usage in Mexico City. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the student fails to explain how these initiatives will lead to a significant decrease in car usage in the future.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks a clear and logical structure. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the high cost of gas to the negative impact of cars on the environment. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion that ties together the various points made in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, agreeing with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The essay provides some specific reasons to support this claim, including the desire for new experiences, the ability to engage in physical activities, and the opportunity to make fun and relaxing things. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""Young people may wish to experince emotions that they have never tried before because of their age"" should be rewritten as ""Young people may wish to experience emotions that they have never tried before because of their age."" This suggests that the student needs to pay closer attention to grammar rules and practice writing in English more frequently.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary is limited, leading to repetitive and simplistic expressions. For example, the phrase ""enjoy life more"" is used multiple times, and the student could have used more varied vocabulary to convey the same idea. Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. For instance, instead of simply stating that young people enjoy sports, the student could have mentioned specific sports or activities that they enjoy and why.

Thirdly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the desire for new experiences to the ability to engage in physical activities. A clearer transition between paragraphs would help to create a more cohesive and logical flow of ideas.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought or reflection on the topic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that there will be more cars in use in twenty years. The essay provides several reasons to support this claim, including economic growth in countries like China and India, the reduction in car prices due to competition, and the improvement in car quality. The student also mentions the construction of new infrastructure to accommodate the expected increase in the number of cars.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence, with some sentences feeling disconnected from the rest of the essay. For example, the sentence ""it uilt in order to absorve an important increase in the number of cars  provide better hicars will be safer, more economic and more population"" seems to be a jumbled collection of words and ideas. Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with some words and phrases being used incorrectly (e.g. ""undeveloped markets"" instead of ""developing markets"").

Furthermore, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention the economic growth of China and India, but do not provide any concrete data or statistics to back up this claim. Similarly, they mention the reduction in car prices, but do not explain how this will lead to an increase in the number of cars.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear, as they seem to be arguing that the increase in cars will be beneficial (e.g. ""hicars will be safer, more economic and more population""), which is not necessarily supported by the rest of the essay.

The essay attempts to address the given prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The writer has provided some relevant points to support their argument, but they often lack concrete examples and evidence to strengthen their claims. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The writer starts by stating that ""Athough people enjoyment differs from stage to stage, youth enjoys more as compared with the older people is definitely reasonable to agree with the statement,"" which is a vague and incomplete sentence. A more effective approach would be to provide a clear and direct thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

The writer attempts to provide reasons for why young people enjoy life more than older people, citing the influence of technology and the energy levels of young people. However, these points are not fully developed and lack concrete examples to support them. For instance, the writer states that ""Youngers are more affectionated to the day to day development of technology, by using those things they enjoying more,"" but fails to provide specific examples of how technology enhances their enjoyment of life.

The writer also attempts to address the counterargument that older people may not enjoy life as much due to health problems and a lack of awareness of new technologies. However, this section is not well-integrated into the rest of the essay and feels like an afterthought.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often inaccurate, with numerous spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay. For example, ""Athough"" should be spelled ""Although,"" and ""by using them that were available enjoying life"" is a grammatically incorrect sentence.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of youth to discussing the challenges faced by older people. A more effective approach would be to provide a clear transition between these two ideas and to use evidence to support each point.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively agreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than today in twenty years. However, their argumentation is somewhat limited and lacks depth. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide some relevant examples and reasons to support their claim. For instance, they mention the development of alternative fuel sources by corporations such as Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai, which is a valid point. Additionally, they highlight the growth of cities and the increasing need for fast and cheap transportation, which is a reasonable argument.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The student jumps between different ideas without providing clear transitions or connections between paragraphs. For example, the paragraph about the growth of cities and the need for cars seems unrelated to the previous paragraph about alternative fuel sources.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors and inaccuracies. For instance, ""tranport"" should be ""transport,"" ""feul"" should be ""fuel,"" and ""Thease"" should be ""These."" Additionally, the student uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks variety in vocabulary.

The use of simple sentence structures and a limited vocabulary restricts the student's ability to effectively convey their ideas.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and logical connections between the student's ideas. The student jumps abruptly from stating that many people buy cars to mentioning the design and look of new cars, without providing a clear link between these points. This makes it difficult to understand the student's reasoning.

Furthermore, the student's use of phrases such as ""so many people"" and ""a lot of"" is repetitive and does not add any depth to their argument. Additionally, the student fails to provide specific examples or evidence to support their claims, making their argument seem unsubstantiated.

The student also struggles with grammar and sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""And some people buy one car, after that they buy new car"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Similarly, the sentence ""So many in twenty years there will be so many cars in more use than there are today"" is confusing and lacks coherence.

Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, with several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choice (e.g., ""young peolpe,"" ""whith,"" ""grantchildren"").

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a personal anecdote and examples from their cultural background to support their stance that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

Firstly, the student's introduction is clear and concise, stating their opinion and providing a thesis statement. However, the essay could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of the topic. The student's examples from their Egyptian culture are interesting, but they are not fully developed, and the connections to the topic are not always clear.

One of the main issues with the essay is the student's use of the term ""fact"" and ""concept."" While they attempt to distinguish between the two, their understanding of these terms is not entirely accurate. In the context of the essay, the student seems to be using ""fact"" to refer to cultural norms or traditions, which are not necessarily objective truths. This confusion could be clarified by providing a more explicit definition of these terms and explaining how they relate to the topic.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, such as the use of ""i"" instead of ""I"" and missing articles.

In terms of content, the student's examples from their cultural background are engaging, but they could be more effectively used to support their argument.

They have effectively used the idiom ""Change is the only constant in life"" to introduce their argument and have provided relevant examples to illustrate their points. The student has also shown an awareness of the importance of analyzing plans and taking calculated risks, which is a crucial aspect of taking risks in a responsible manner.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it requires improvement in several areas to achieve a higher score. The writer provides a personal example of organizing a party to help poor children and assisting with homework, which shows some understanding of the topic. However, the essay lacks depth and variety in supporting reasons and examples. The writer relies heavily on personal experiences and fails to provide a balanced view by considering alternative perspectives. The language and grammar also need improvement, with several errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and spelling.

The writer starts by agreeing with the statement and provides a personal reason for why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, citing their busy schedules. However, the explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks supporting evidence. The writer's personal experience of being a university student and feeling too busy to help the community is relatable, but it is not a convincing argument for the entire generation. The writer also fails to provide any concrete statistics or research to support their claim.

The writer's use of language is another area that needs improvement. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""I wuold like to make"" instead of ""I would like to make,"" ""I am a student at University"" instead of ""I am a student at university,"" and ""I do not enough spare time"" instead of ""I do not have enough spare time."" The writer also uses informal language, such as ""my boyfriend and my friend"" instead of ""my boyfriend and my friends.""

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing reasons and examples to support their disagreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the introduction is clear and concise, and the student has effectively stated their stance on the issue. However, the transition to the body paragraphs could be smoother, and the use of connecting words or phrases would help to link the ideas more cohesively.

In the body paragraphs, the student has provided some relevant reasons for why they disagree with the statement, such as population growth, lower production costs, and the improvement of transportation systems. However, the explanations are not always clear, and some sentences are worded awkwardly. For instance, the sentence ""low cost of production given by modern technologies and new materials allows more people to buy a car"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student also attempts to provide examples to support their arguments, such as the case of Italy, but this example is not fully developed. A more detailed explanation of how the underdeveloped public transportation system in Italy contributes to the increased demand for cars would strengthen the argument.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""allover"" should be ""all over,"" and ""peole"" should be ""people.""

Finally, the conclusion is clear and effectively summarizes the student's argument. However, it would be more effective if the student had provided a more nuanced conclusion that took into account potential counterarguments or limitations of their argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay provides some specific examples, including the i-pod advertisement, to support the argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""sellI,"" ""nessasary,"" ""peolple,"" and ""hoolywood."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Additionally, the student often uses informal language, such as ""many times,"" which is not suitable for formal writing.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentences. For instance, the phrase ""it is seemed to us many times"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better expression. The student also fails to provide a clear thesis statement, which would have helped to guide the reader through the essay.

The student's use of examples is a strength, as they provide specific instances of how advertisements can make products seem more attractive. However, the analysis of these examples is limited, and the student could have explored the implications of this phenomenon in more depth.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps between ideas and fails to provide a logical flow of arguments. The conclusion is also somewhat repetitive, restating the main point without adding any new insights.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, including the redirection of efforts to help those in need in other communities, the role of non-government organizations (NGOs), and the growing awareness of global issues due to improved communication and information systems.

Strengths of the essay include:

- The writer provides concrete examples, such as the Red Cross and Oxfam, to support their argument.
- They acknowledge the role of social corporate responsibility in companies' decisions to donate funds to NGOs.
- The essay touches on the idea that young people are helping, but not necessarily in their own neighborhoods, which is a valid point.

However, there are areas for improvement:

- The introduction could be stronger, as it simply states the writer's agreement without providing a clear thesis statement or context.
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""not necesarily in thei"" (should be ""not necessarily in their own neighborhoods"").
- There are some grammatical errors, such as ""worldwidenad"" (should be ""worldwide"").
- The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the writer's points, particularly in the conclusion.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two examples from their business experience to support their disagreement with the statement. However, their writing is marred by several issues that hinder the clarity and effectiveness of their argument.

Firstly, the student's introduction is abrupt and lacks a clear thesis statement. They simply state their disagreement without providing a concise summary of their argument. This makes it challenging for the reader to understand the direction of their essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, the transition from the first example to the second example is abrupt, and the student fails to provide a clear link between the two.

Thirdly, the student's language is often informal and contains grammatical errors. For example, ""Thinking of my business experience"" should be ""Drawing on my business experience,"" and ""the concepts are written in this documents"" should be ""the concepts are written in these documents."" Additionally, the student uses colloquial expressions such as ""periodedly"" instead of ""periodically.""

Lastly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While they provide two instances from their business experience, they fail to analyze or explain the implications of these examples in detail. This makes it difficult for the reader to fully understand the relevance of these examples to the statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. The essay provides some relevant examples, such as the comparison between cars and aircraft, to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to provide a clear thesis statement and supported it with examples.
2. They have demonstrated an understanding of the concepts of ideas, concepts, and facts, and how they relate to learning.
3. The essay attempts to provide a logical flow of ideas, with the student using transitional phrases to connect their thoughts.

Weaknesses:

1. The writing is often unclear and lacks coherence, with sentences that are grammatically incorrect or worded awkwardly.
2. The student relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""Ideas are the way by which one would learn about something by his past knowledge, by his past experience or by your imagination."" This sentence lacks specificity and clarity.
3. The examples provided, while relevant, are not fully developed and lack concrete details.
4. The student often uses incorrect vocabulary, such as ""tranportation"" instead of ""transportation"" and ""founadtion"" instead of ""foundation.""
5. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis, as the student's arguments are often simplistic and lack depth.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Revise the essay to ensure that sentences are clear, concise, and grammatically correct.
2. Provide more specific and detailed examples to support the argument.
3. Use more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary to convey complex ideas.
4. Develop a more logical and coherent structure for the essay, with clear transitions between ideas.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides various examples from their personal life, such as learning to walk, going to school, and learning to surf, to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often informal, with several grammatical errors, such as ""it is a need to take risks"" (should be ""it is necessary to take risks""), ""we are all born with no knolege"" (should be ""no knowledge""), and ""in my oppinion"" (should be ""in my opinion""). Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words like ""new"" and ""take risks.""

Furthermore, the student's examples, although personal and relatable, are not always directly related to the statement. For instance, the example of learning to walk is a universal human experience, but it is not directly connected to the idea of taking risks for success. The example of learning to surf is more relevant, but it would be more effective if the student had elaborated on how this experience helped them become successful.

In terms of organization, the student's paragraphs could be more cohesive, with clearer topic sentences and transitions between ideas. The conclusion, while enthusiastic, feels somewhat abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to provide a clear stance on the given prompt, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""Th be specific, I can go wherever I want and spend a lot of time in some place without any resistant"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand. A more accurate sentence would be ""To be specific, I can go wherever I want and spend a lot of time in some place without any restrictions."" 

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several instances of incorrect word choice. For example, ""bagpack"" should be ""backpack,"" ""ting"" should be ""thing,"" and ""vistied"" should be ""visited."" 

Furthermore, the student's supporting reasons and examples are somewhat vague and lack specific details. While the student mentions that traveling alone or with a friend provides freedom and excitement, they do not provide concrete evidence to support these claims. For instance, the example about visiting Italy is interesting, but it could be more detailed and well-structured.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the student's stance and provide a final thought on the topic.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with clear arguments to support their stance. The writer has effectively used examples from different countries, such as Turkey, India, New York City, and California, to illustrate the complexities of the issue. This shows that the student is able to think critically and consider multiple perspectives.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""immidiate"" instead of ""immediate,"" ""brirefly"" instead of ""briefly,"" and ""predilictions"" instead of ""predictions."" These errors can make the text difficult to understand and detract from the overall quality of the writing.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is not always precise. For example, the phrase ""a body of reasons both to agree and disagree with the statement"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity. Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the examples they provided, rather than simply presenting them as isolated instances.

Finally, the student's conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay. The mention of a ""genious scientist"" coming up with a new invention is a bit of a non-sequitur and could be omitted or integrated more smoothly into the rest of the essay.

The student has provided a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively expressing their disagreement with the statement. They have used specific examples from their personal experience to support their argument, which demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The student's writing is coherent and easy to follow, with a logical structure that effectively connects their ideas.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""I somewhat disagree"" and ""I believe that it is imortant"" could be replaced with more precise language to convey their thoughts. Additionally, the student's use of transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, with more effective linking words and phrases to connect their ideas.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the topic could be more in-depth. While they provide a clear personal example, they do not fully explore the implications of specializing in one subject versus having broad knowledge of many subjects. For instance, they could discuss the potential benefits of interdisciplinary learning or the limitations of specializing too narrowly.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two reasons to support their disagreement with the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I disagree wtih that,"" ""neccessay,"" and ""primaly."" These errors detract from the clarity and coherence of the essay, making it challenging to understand the student's intended message. Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic, which limits the effectiveness of their arguments.

Regarding the content, the student's first reason, ""it is neccessay to learn basic knowlege for understanding ideas and concept,"" is somewhat unclear. The example provided from the Japanese university system is relevant, but the connection to the statement is not explicitly stated. The student could have elaborated on how the basic knowledge learned in the early stages of education lays the foundation for understanding more complex ideas and concepts.

The second reason, ""learning facts is essential for correct idea,"" is more convincing. The example from nutritional study is a good illustration of how facts are necessary for understanding complex concepts. However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis to support this argument.

To improve, the student should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. They should also strive to provide more nuanced and detailed explanations to support their arguments.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured, with two main examples provided to support the argument: marriage and career choices. The student has attempted to use reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a good start.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""there are so many examples in which we can observ this difficult part of life"" (should be ""observe"") and ""the person He/She is dating"" (should be ""the person he/she is dating""). Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, making the text feel a bit flat.

In terms of content, the student's examples are somewhat disconnected from the main argument. While the examples are relevant, they could be more effectively integrated into the essay to create a more cohesive narrative. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing marriage to career choices without providing a clear link between the two.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""some problems might arise"" and ""it is not a good idea to close your mind"" are a bit generic and could be replaced with more precise and descriptive language.

Lastly, the student's conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay. A more effective conclusion would summarize the main points and reiterate the thesis statement in a more compelling way.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, with the writer strongly disagreeing with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. The writer provides three examples from different fields, including biology, literature, and sports, to support their argument. 

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are often inaccurate, with numerous spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage"" is a confusing phrase, and ""perticular"" should be spelled as ""particular."" Additionally, the writer's sentence structure is often simplistic, with a lack of complex sentences and varied vocabulary.

Furthermore, the writer's examples, although interesting, are not always well-integrated into the essay. The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the writer fails to provide sufficient analysis of the examples. For example, the writer mentions that the biologist studied pea plants for over 20 years, but does not explain how this relates to the topic of specialization.

Despite these issues, the writer shows some understanding of the topic and provides a clear thesis statement. The writer also attempts to use evidence from various fields to support their argument, which demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides specific examples to support their argument, such as the advertisement for a cigarette company, which effectively illustrates the point that advertisements often use attractive models to sell products.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For instance, the phrase ""Who has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his/her own needs and wants?"" could be rephrased to something like ""It's hard to imagine someone who hasn't been influenced by an advertisement that caters to their desires."" Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""In addition, the way they are put together they appeal to the viewers' eyes; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement."" A more natural way to phrase this would be ""Furthermore, the way advertisements are designed is to capture the viewer's attention and make them want to buy the product.""

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation at times. For example, the sentence ""In conclusion, it seems athat in today's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and people who try to sell things."" should be rephrased to ""In conclusion, it seems that in today's world we are surrounded and bombarded by advertisements and people who try to sell things."" The use of ""a"" before ""that"" is incorrect, and the word ""enclosed"" is not the best choice to convey the idea of being surrounded by advertisements.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some effective examples to support their argument. With further practice and attention to grammar and vocabulary, the student has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, organization, and language accuracy. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and logical structure. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a smooth transition between paragraphs. For instance, the first paragraph introduces the disagreement with the statement, but the second paragraph seems to be a repetition of the same idea without adding any new information. The third paragraph attempts to provide reasons for the disagreement, but it is unclear and lacks specific examples to support the claims.

In terms of language accuracy, the student has made several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay. For example, ""he or she wants"" should be ""he or she has,"" ""conquest his dream or his desire"" should be ""pursue his dreams or desires,"" and ""doens't"" should be ""doesn't."" Additionally, the student has used incorrect verb tenses, such as ""In fact I think"" which should be ""In fact, I think.""

The student has also failed to provide specific examples to support their claims. For instance, when stating that older people know how to fight for their dreams, the student does not provide any concrete examples or evidence to back up this claim. Similarly, when discussing the problems caused by industrialization, the student does not provide any specific examples or statistics to support their argument.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""insteed"" instead of ""instead,"" ""frorm"" instead of ""from,"" and ""thecniques"" instead of ""techniques."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive phrases such as ""it was already clarified centuries ago by someone else"" and ""they rather."" Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of the examples, rather than simply stating that students are not interested in understanding the underlying concepts.

The student's analysis of the reasons behind students' lack of interest in understanding ideas and concepts is also somewhat simplistic, attributing it solely to the pressure to get a good degree. A more comprehensive analysis would consider other factors, such as the complexity of the subject matter, the teaching methods used, and the students' individual interests and motivations.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided some relevant points to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""On the other hand"" and ""So in my opinion."" This demonstrates a good understanding of how to organize their thoughts and present them in a logical manner.

The student also attempts to use examples to support their argument, such as the decreasing amount of petrol stored in the earth's crust and the increasing price of petrol. However, these examples are not always clearly linked to the main argument, and some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, making them difficult to understand.

One of the main weaknesses of the essay is the student's use of grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, such as ""scientist's researches,"" ""dugged,"" and ""IRONIC isn't it?!"" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the student's use of sentence structure is often simplistic, with many short, simple sentences that lack variety. This makes the essay feel a bit flat and unengaging.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not always well-supported. For example, they state that electric energy is not dependable because it is conducted by conductors that work on petrol, but this is not a clear or convincing reason.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. The writer provides two main reasons for their agreement with the statement, which is a good start. However, the reasons are not fully developed, and the supporting examples could be more detailed and effective.

One of the main issues is the lack of coherence between the introduction and the body paragraphs. The writer states that young people do not have time to help their communities due to studying, but this point is not fully explored. The second reason, that young people are not interested in helping communities, is also not well-supported. The writer mentions that schools do not teach the importance of community service, but this is not a clear reason for young people's lack of interest.

The writer also struggles with grammar and vocabulary. For example, ""On of the reason"" should be ""One of the reasons,"" and ""comunicating"" should be ""communicating."" Additionally, the sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety. The writer could benefit from using more complex sentences and varied vocabulary to make their writing more engaging.

The student's use of examples, such as the marketing manager and the doctors, is effective in illustrating their points.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as the essay sometimes feels disjointed. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as ""approcah"" instead of ""approach"" and ""deicdes"" instead of ""decides."" Furthermore, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

The student's use of vocabulary is generally good, but there are some instances of overuse of simple phrases, such as ""I personally feel"" and ""I would present."" The student could benefit from varying their sentence structure and using more complex vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has provided some effective examples to support their answer. However, there are some areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, and vocabulary.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of relevant examples to support the argument. The student has effectively used the scarcity of resources and the potential for new technologies to replace cars as valid reasons for the decline in car usage. Additionally, the student has demonstrated an understanding of the concept of technological advancements and their impact on society.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Now a days"" instead of ""Nowadays,"" ""may be in scarcity"" instead of ""may be scarce,"" and ""vechicle"" instead of ""vehicle."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words such as ""new"" and ""may."" This lack of variety in vocabulary makes the writing seem simplistic and unengaging. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their argument, such as the rise of electric vehicles or the increasing popularity of public transportation.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the thesis statement and provide a final thought on the implications of the argument.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, but the organization and coherence of the essay are not always clear. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer seems to be arguing that young people do not have enough time to help their communities, but this is not explicitly stated until the final paragraph. Additionally, the writer jumps between different ideas and examples without fully developing them.

The writer attempts to use specific examples, such as students studying with others to gain more information, but these examples are not fully supported or explained. The writer also uses some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which can make the essay difficult to follow.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The essay provides three main examples to support this claim: inventing new things, finding alternative solutions to existing problems, and taking risks in scientific experiments.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to use relevant examples from real-life scenarios, such as the story of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and the invention of new metals, to support their argument.
2. The essay attempts to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas, which is a good effort for a second language learner.
3. The student has demonstrated an understanding of the concept of risk-taking and its potential benefits.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and clarity in some parts, with sentences that are not fully grammatically correct or logically connected.
2. The student relies heavily on clichés, such as ""after all"" and ""finally,"" which do not add much value to the argument.

2.  The writer has attempted to use examples from their personal experience and observations to illustrate their points.
3.  The essay attempts to address the potential counterarguments, such as the idea that older people may not have the physical strength or patience to enjoy life.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks coherence and logical flow, with ideas and sentences often disconnected from one another.
2.  The writer relies heavily on personal opinions and general statements, rather than providing concrete evidence or specific examples to support their claims.
3.  The use of grammar, spelling, and punctuation is often incorrect, which can make the essay difficult to understand.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear stance on the topic. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are some areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to illustrate the point that advertisements can create a subjective impression of a product. The writer effectively uses the example of a car advertisement featuring a beautiful driver to demonstrate how the presentation of a product can be subjective and create an illusion. Additionally, the writer provides a clear and concise thesis statement in the final paragraph, summarizing their opinion on the statement.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer often uses simple sentences and lacks variety in sentence structure, which can make the essay seem a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""Advertising in the art of convincing customers to buy specific products"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging. Additionally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claim that advertisements are subjective and that customers are aware of this.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, the sentence ""That is not the original purpose, even if it provides sometimes useful information, and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and grammar.

In terms of vocabulary, the writer could have used more precise and nuanced words to describe the concept of advertisements and their impact on customers. For example, instead of using the phrase ""game of seduction,"" the writer could have used a more sophisticated term like ""marketing strategy"" or ""persuasive technique.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word usage (e.g., ""new things create success"" instead of ""trying new things leads to success"").

The student provides two examples, Bill Gates and Thomas Edison, to support their argument. While these examples are relevant, they are not fully developed, and the student fails to provide specific details about how these individuals' willingness to take risks contributed to their success. The student also uses vague phrases, such as ""stationary life"" and ""overcross other competetors,"" which may not be easily understood by the reader.

Despite these limitations, the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and attempts to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, the writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure to improve clarity and coherence.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, effectively agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student has provided several relevant examples from history, such as Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Bill Gates, to support their argument. These examples are well-chosen and help to illustrate the point that trying new things and taking risks can lead to success.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity, which makes the writing seem a bit flat. Additionally, there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as missing articles and incorrect use of commas.

The student's use of transitions between paragraphs is also somewhat limited, which can make the essay feel a bit disjointed at times.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people: their physical condition and their fresh outlook on life. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""beacause"" instead of ""because,"" ""thier"" instead of ""their,"" and ""off-litimts"" instead of ""out of limits."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

Secondly, the student's arguments are not well-supported by concrete evidence. While they mention that young people have a ""vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind,"" they fail to provide any concrete examples to back up this claim. Similarly, their assertion that older people are limited by their physical condition is based on a generalization and lacks specific examples.

Thirdly, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. For instance, the second paragraph starts with ""On the other hand,"" but the contrast between the two paragraphs is not explicitly stated.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The final sentence is incomplete and does not provide a satisfying conclusion to the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the best ways to travel. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has provided several reasons to support their argument, including the opportunity to meet new people, discovering new places, and gaining knowledge about the history and significance of the locations visited.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often simplistic, with a limited range of vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, the phrase ""this seems to make it more special and interesting"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging and varied. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and lack clarity, such as ""People usually travelling alone to another countries and trying to explore the best places by themselves, are going to face much difficulties doing that since they don't have any idea of what they are looking for, and whether they will like or not."" A more concise and clear sentence would be ""Traveling alone can be challenging, especially when you're not sure what to look for or what you'll like.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more specific examples to support their arguments. While they mention that a tour guide will show tourists ""amazing places,"" it would be more effective to provide a specific example of a place or experience that they had on a guided tour.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""definately"" instead of ""definitely,"" ""latter"" instead of ""later,"" and ""may"" instead of ""maybe."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, making the essay feel disjointed at times. For example, the transition between the first and second body paragraphs is abrupt, and the use of ""Summarising"" to introduce the final paragraph feels like a weak attempt to conclude the essay.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, and the writer provides some specific reasons to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's attempt to use personal experience as an example to support their claim. The anecdote about the lotion that failed to deliver its promised results is a good way to illustrate the point that advertisements can be misleading. However, the writer could have elaborated more on this experience, providing more details about the product and the advertisement to make the example more convincing.

Another positive aspect of the essay is the writer's attempt to consider multiple perspectives. They acknowledge that companies need to make their products look efficient to compete in the market, which shows an understanding of the complexities of the issue. However, this point could be developed further to provide a more nuanced argument.

On the other hand, there are several areas that need improvement. The writer struggles with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure, which makes the text difficult to follow at times. For example, the sentence ""After using the product for a while, and even finishing it all, nothing happened. I didn't loose any inches, in fact."" is unclear and could be rephrased for better coherence. Additionally, the writer uses some colloquial expressions, such as ""trully believe"" and ""oherwise,"" which are not suitable for formal writing.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that some companies omit important information, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. This lack of evidence makes the argument less convincing.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and reiterate the thesis statement in a more concise manner.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of prepositions. For instance, the sentence ""I believe strongly that the question seems to be controversial in one way and very relative because i can see that, it depends on persons' views and thereby the conditions also under wich the travel is made"" is a good example of this. The student should strive to use more precise and accurate language to convey their ideas.

Secondly, the student's organization and coherence could be improved.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's ideas are somewhat coherent, but the writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of sophistication in vocabulary. The writer's use of examples, although intended to support their argument, often feels forced and lacks depth.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the writer's enthusiasm and conviction in their argument. They effectively convey the idea that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can lead to success in personal and professional life. The writer's personal anecdote about their uncle is a good example of how they have applied this principle in their own life.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks clarity. For instance, the opening sentence, ""Have you met a person who is knowledgable? You might say in your heart. How creative and smart he is! But have you tried to be knowledgable like him?"" is unclear and confusing. The writer's use of vocabulary is also limited, with words like ""sophistacated"" and ""benifis"" being used incorrectly.

Furthermore, the writer's examples, although intended to support their argument, often feel disconnected from the main topic. The anecdote about the writer's uncle, while well-intentioned, feels like a non-sequitur and does not directly relate to the topic of broad knowledge versus specialization. The example about the writer's job at the Capital Bank of Saudi Arabia is more relevant, but it feels like an afterthought and could be developed further.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to providing examples, without a clear transition between the two. The conclusion feels like a rehashing of the introduction, without adding any new insights or depth to the argument.

However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

The student's writing is generally clear, but there are some errors in verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and sentence construction. For instance, in the first paragraph, the student writes ""advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product,"" which should be ""advertisements tend to overexaggerate the effect of the product."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""speical elements"" instead of ""special elements,"" and ""exegerates"" instead of ""exaggerates."" These errors can be distracting and affect the overall coherence of the essay.

In terms of vocabulary, the student could benefit from using more precise and nuanced language to convey their ideas. For example, instead of saying ""the product can be bad,"" the student could say ""the product may have its limitations"" or ""the product may not be as effective as claimed."" The student also uses some idiomatic expressions, such as ""marvel at its magical effect,"" which is a good attempt to use more complex language, but could be improved with more context.

1.  The student has effectively used specific examples to support their arguments, such as the Delhi Metro Rail system in India, which has reduced the number of cars on the roads. This shows that they can think critically and provide concrete evidence to back up their claims.
2.  The student has demonstrated an understanding of the relationship between population growth and the availability of land, which is a crucial point in their argument.
3.  They have also highlighted the importance of environmental awareness and how it can lead to a decrease in car usage, which is a valid point.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""consciouness"" instead of ""consciousness,"" ""negligibel"" instead of ""negligible,"" and ""nascent stage"" is used correctly but the sentence structure is a bit awkward. These errors can make the essay difficult to follow at times.
2.  Some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, ""The population of the world is only growing by the day"" could be simplified to ""The world's population is growing rapidly.""
3.  The student could have provided more depth and analysis in their arguments. For instance, they could have explored the potential consequences of a decrease in car usage, such as the impact on the economy or the benefits of alternative modes of transportation.

Evaluation:

The student has made a good effort to express their opinion on the given topic, and their writing is understandable. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""Everybody can notice that nowadays the mass media is the most powerful thing that can leave a massive influence on us special on taneegers & children"" (should be ""teenagers and children""), ""tow reasons"" (should be ""two reasons""), ""wonderfull way"" (should be ""wonderful way""), ""sencor"" (should be ""sensor""), and ""pooked"" (should be ""booked""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, ""The first reason is they do all the advertising about something in a wonderfull way that show you it is the best thing for you & you cant live without it"" could be rephrased to ""The first reason is that advertisements often present products in an overly positive light, making them seem indispensable."" This would not only improve the sentence structure but also enhance the overall clarity and sophistication of the writing.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat effective in supporting their argument, but they could be more detailed and nuanced. For instance, the example about the straightener could be expanded to include more specific details about the product's performance and how it failed to meet the student's expectations.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of their main points. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought or call to action.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, effectively disagreeing with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay provides several examples to support the argument, including the development of mass production in the automobile industry and the success of Bill Gates. However, the student's writing contains several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples to support their argument. The use of specific instances, such as the development of mass production in the automobile industry and Bill Gates' success, helps to illustrate the point being made. Additionally, the student attempts to address potential counterarguments by mentioning that there are other factors that contribute to success, such as good opportunities.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""approuve,"" ""caracteristics,"" and ""nor than."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""real good opportunitie"" and ""realy successful person"" being used instead of more precise language.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure. The student jumps between different ideas and examples without fully developing each point. For instance, the discussion of Bill Gates' success is introduced but not fully explored. Additionally, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Finally, the student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is limited, making it difficult to follow the flow of the essay. For example, the student jumps from discussing Bill Gates to stating that ""every successful business manager is different"" without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay to support their opinion. The essay starts with a relevant example of a common advertisement trope, effectively grabbing the reader's attention. The student then expands on this idea, providing a clear distinction between advertisements for goods and services, highlighting the use of attractive settings and people to make products seem more appealing.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Hoever"" instead of ""However,"" and ""vaste"" instead of ""vast."" These errors can make the text difficult to follow and detract from the overall clarity of the argument.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is sometimes imprecise. For example, the phrase ""in a nutshell"" is used correctly, but the student's attempt to use it in the final sentence is awkwardly phrased. Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas could be improved.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. The writer attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but the execution is often marred by errors in sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors, such as ""nowadyas,"" ""peple,"" ""communites,"" ""diffrent,"" ""nautre,"" and ""obvoius."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing. Additionally, the writer struggles to use complex sentence structures, often resorting to simple sentences that lack variety.

The writer also fails to provide a clear and well-supported thesis statement. The opening sentence is a direct repetition of the prompt, and the subsequent paragraphs lack a clear direction or focus. The writer jumps between different ideas, such as the benefits of studying and working, helping others in hospitals, and the existence of both helpful and unhelpful students.

However, the writer does attempt to provide some examples to support their argument, such as volunteering at hospitals and participating in community events. These ideas are not fully developed, but they demonstrate a glimmer of understanding of the topic.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their grammar and vocabulary, as well as developing a clear and focused thesis statement. They should also strive to provide more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments.

The student starts by stating their disagreement with the statement, but the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement and fails to provide a logical connection to the rest of the essay. The student then provides a historical account of the evolution of transportation, which is not directly related to the topic. This section appears to be a digression and does not contribute to the main argument.

The student attempts to address the main argument by stating that people will not give up their cars due to their addiction and the increasing population. However, the reasoning is not well-supported, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims. The mention of alternative technologies, such as solar-powered cars, is a good attempt, but it is not fully developed.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and a lack of cohesion between sentences. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""it is a compulsory now"" and ""ithink it will not happen,"" detract from the overall quality of the writing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides some relevant examples to support their argument, such as the anecdote about their favorite teacher in high school.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often simplistic and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack connecting words, making the text feel disjointed at times. For example, the sentence ""The first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea"" could be rephrased to ""In the initial stages of education, it is essential for students to learn how to study and understand new ideas effectively."" This would improve the sentence's clarity and grammatical correctness.

Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple words and phrases. For instance, the phrase ""memoy's exercises"" should be ""memory's exercises"" or ""memory exercises."" Furthermore, the student could benefit from using more precise and technical vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""cognitive development"" or ""critical thinking.""

The student's use of examples is also somewhat limited. While the anecdote about their favorite teacher is a good start, it could be developed further to provide more insight into the teacher's methods and how they contributed to the student's understanding of concepts. The student could also benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as research or statistics on the benefits of concept-based learning.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points made in the essay and re-emphasized the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. The current conclusion feels somewhat repetitive and could be more impactful with a stronger final statement.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided several reasons to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided specific examples and reasons to support their argument, such as the hectic schedules of people, their preference for other activities, and their lack of awareness about community service. These examples are relevant to the topic and demonstrate the student's understanding of the issue.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""The communities can prosper only when everyone gets along and make the community better in many ways,"" ""they are so preoccupied with other matters that they dont give that much prefernece to whats going on in the community,"" and ""The people who do not do coommunity service does not know what it is all about.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide reasons and examples to support their answer.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than today in twenty years. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise language. The writer uses simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which is understandable for a second language learner. However, the sentences are often fragmented, and the writer struggles to express complex ideas. For instance, the sentence ""Car polling is a subject being disscussed every where in the world"" is unclear and should be rephrased to ""Car pollution is a subject being discussed everywhere in the world.""

The writer also fails to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. While they mention the increase in the world population and the idea that everyone needs a car, these points are not well-developed or supported by concrete examples. The writer's personal anecdote about their father driving them to school is an interesting addition, but it does not contribute significantly to the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize their main points. The sentence ""Subways and undergrounds are very good ways to ease the problem of the traffic jamming, but it will never replace the car and this wh"" is incomplete and should be revised to provide a clear conclusion.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to demonstrate a more effective and coherent argument.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as ""I agree with the statement that most advertise show more facts of the products than they really have"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""The advertise is mean to show the good effects of the products"" (subject-verb agreement error). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words like ""phonomenen"" (should be ""phenomenon"") and ""merchanes"" (should be ""merchandise""). Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic, with a lack of varied sentence lengths and complexity.

Thirdly, the student's arguments are not well-supported by evidence. While the student mentions that companies pay for advertisements to increase sales, this is a general statement that could be applied to any business, not specifically to advertisements. Furthermore, the example of a woman wanting to lose weight is not a convincing argument, as it is a personal anecdote rather than a generalizable phenomenon.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is not well-summarized, with the final sentence being a repetition of the statement from the prompt.

The essay provides some relevant examples to support the argument, including the case study of Silvio Berlusconi. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to provide a clear and concise thesis statement, agreeing with the prompt.
2. The use of a specific example, Silvio Berlusconi, is a good attempt to support the argument.
3. The student has demonstrated some understanding of the concept of innovation and risk-taking in the context of business and personal success.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and logical flow, with abrupt transitions between ideas.
2. The student has not fully addressed the counterargument, which is a crucial aspect of a well-structured essay.
3. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than other to do and learn new things"" (should be ""more curious than others to do and learn new things"").
4. The student has not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that curiosity, capabilities, and inclination to try new things are the primary factors contributing to success.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples from everyday life, such as supermarkets and television advertisements, to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing is often simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of complex vocabulary. For example, the phrase ""it is sufficient to go in a supermarket"" could be rephrased to ""a visit to a supermarket is enough to see"" to improve sentence structure and vocabulary. Additionally, the student could benefit from using more nuanced language to express their ideas, such as ""the advertisements often create unrealistic expectations"" instead of ""the advertisements look to the history of the company.""

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation, with several errors throughout the essay.

Furthermore, the student could improve their use of transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""however"" or ""in addition to.""

The essay demonstrates some understanding of the topic, but it is marred by numerous grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors. The writer attempts to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer, but the arguments are not well-organized and lack coherence. The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and the sentences are often fragmented and unclear.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's attempt to address the topic from multiple angles, including the impact of societal changes, the availability of entertainment options, and the education system. However, the writer's arguments are not well-supported, and the examples provided are not convincing.

For instance, the writer states that young people do not have enough time to help their communities due to traffic and communication issues, but this is not a convincing argument, as it is not clear how these issues prevent young people from helping their communities. Similarly, the writer's claim that young people prefer to watch movies and go out with friends instead of helping their communities is not supported by evidence.

The writer also makes a valid point about the education system not teaching young people the importance of helping others, but this argument is not developed further. The writer's conclusion is also unclear, as they state that everyone is responsible for the problem, but do not provide a clear solution.

To improve, the writer should focus on developing clear and coherent arguments, providing convincing evidence to support their claims, and using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given topic, with the writer expressing their disagreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, the essay could benefit from more effective organization and coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas and reasons without a clear logical flow, making it challenging to follow their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to support their claims. For instance, they mention the prevalence of corruption, violence, and crime among young people as a reason for their lack of community involvement. Additionally, they highlight the impact of technology on young people's behavior, suggesting that they are more focused on personal development than community service.

However, the writer's use of language and grammar is often imprecise, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Phrases such as ""i certainly believe,"" ""i feel this is because,"" and ""i must say"" are informal and should be replaced with more formal language. Furthermore, there are several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of articles.

The writer also struggles to provide a clear and concise thesis statement, which is essential for a well-structured essay. The introduction is vague, and the writer jumps into the main body without a clear direction. The conclusion is also weak, as it simply reiterates the writer's initial statement without providing a summary of the main points.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on refining their language, grammar, and organization. They should also work on providing a clear and concise thesis statement and a more logical flow of ideas.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. Their essay is well-structured, and they have provided personal anecdotes to support their argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of a personal example from their experience as a nursing major. This example effectively illustrates the difference between learning facts and understanding concepts, and how the latter is more valuable in the long run. The student also provides a clear thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, which sets the tone for the rest of the writing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's language skills are not yet proficient, with numerous grammatical errors and typos throughout the essay. For instance, ""I dare say that I agree the statement"" should be ""I agree with the statement,"" and ""lerning"" should be ""learning."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic, which makes the writing seem a bit flat.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their argument. While the anecdote from their nursing experience is helpful, it would be beneficial to include more specific examples from other fields or disciplines to demonstrate the universality of their point.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and summarized the main points made in the essay. As it stands, the conclusion feels a bit repetitive and does not leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing is often fragmented, with short sentences that lack cohesion. For example, the first sentence ""This sentence is truth in part. Because more young people use their time for helping their communities or the person that have need"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer expressing disagreement. The writer provides two personal anecdotes to support their argument, which is a good approach to engage the reader and make the essay more relatable. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the writer's language and grammar need refinement. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect sentence structures. For example, ""it aways happens in the other way"" should be ""it always happens in the other way,"" and ""they wil not show its defects"" should be ""they will not show its defects."" These errors can be distracting and make the essay harder to understand.

Secondly, the writer's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from the general statement to the writer's disagreement and then to the examples. A clearer introduction and conclusion would help to guide the reader through the essay and make it more cohesive. For instance, the writer could have started with a clear thesis statement, followed by the explanation of the statement, and then the examples to support the argument.

Thirdly, the writer's analysis of the examples could be more in-depth. While the writer provides two personal anecdotes, they do not fully explain why these experiences support their argument. For example, the writer could have discussed the specific features of the video-cd player and the cosmetic product that made them seem better than they actually were, and how these features were misleading.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion could be more effective. The writer simply reiterates their disagreement without summarizing the main points or reiterating the thesis statement. A stronger conclusion would leave the reader with a lasting impression and a clear understanding of the writer's argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of examples to support their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and logical structure. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a smooth transition between paragraphs. For instance, the transition from the first paragraph to the second paragraph is abrupt, and the connection between the two is not explicitly stated.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is limited and not effectively utilized to support their argument. The example from the chemistry class is not clearly connected to the main idea, and the student fails to explain how understanding ideas and concepts helped them in that situation. The example of the student's sister is also not relevant to the main argument, and the student's conclusion about putting their heart on God seems out of place in the context of the essay.

In terms of language use, the student struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, and the student often uses simple sentences that lack variety. Additionally, the student's vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on basic phrases and expressions.

The mention of having less competition and customers being open to new ideas and products is a good point. Additionally, the student highlights the importance of hard work and taking risks in achieving success.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""If people have to try new things, in order to become successful, depends on the kind of success of those people"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""In addition, person's who consentrate on there abilities and push them furthermore, are more likely to become promoted then employees who are often trying new things"" (subject-verb agreement error and incorrect use of ""there"" and ""their""). These errors can make the essay difficult to understand and detract from the student's overall message.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of word repetition, such as ""going new way"" and ""achieve there goals."" The student could benefit from using more varied and precise vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their claims.

The essay jumps between agreeing with the statement and providing reasons, without a clear conclusion that ties the ideas together. The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking, making the essay feel disjointed.

However, the writer does attempt to provide a personal anecdote to support their argument, which shows some level of engagement with the topic. The writer also attempts to reiterate their agreement with the statement, which demonstrates some level of understanding of the topic.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, their essay is marred by several grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of their argument. 

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide specific reasons and examples to support their answer. They mention that young people are too busy with work, studies, or leisure activities and are distracted by unnecessary things like browsing, chatting, and drinking in pubs. These are valid points that could be developed further to strengthen their argument.

However, the student's writing is hindered by a lack of cohesion and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the student starts by defining what a community is, but this definition is not connected to the rest of the essay. 

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic phrases and sentences. For example, ""Bcause nowadays young people very much intersted in enjoyment"" could be rephrased as ""Young people are now more interested in enjoying themselves."" Additionally, the student's use of punctuation is inconsistent, with missing articles, incorrect use of commas, and run-on sentences.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing their vocabulary, practicing more complex sentence structures, and working on paragraph cohesion. They should also proofread their work carefully to eliminate grammatical and spelling errors.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of Albert Einstein's quote at the beginning, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer also provides a clear example of Einstein's theory of relativity and its origin, which is a good attempt to illustrate the concept of innovation and risk-taking. 

The writer also attempts to generalize the idea of constant change and its impact on human progress, citing examples of technological advancements from the past to the present. However, the connection between these examples and the original statement could be more explicit. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing Einstein to mentioning Bill Gates, without providing a clear link between the two examples.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of the examples, rather than simply stating that they are successful because they took risks. For instance, the writer could have explored the challenges that Einstein and Gates faced in their respective endeavors and how they overcame them.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to enhance the writing quality. Some sentences, such as ""Constant change is the human nature"" and ""It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, there are a few errors, such as ""Thanks to mankind, who was constantly looking for options to change"" (subject-verb agreement) and ""In summary, it is seen all around, people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who got success and fame"" (sentence structure).

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and effective use of English language. The writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of proper vocabulary. The student's argument is also not well-supported, and they fail to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to address the prompt directly. The statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"" is not explicitly addressed until the conclusion, where the student states that they cannot imagine a world without cars. The majority of the essay focuses on the benefits of cars, but does not provide a clear argument for or against the statement.

The student's use of reasons and examples is also limited. While they mention that cars are considered a status symbol, are comfortable, and are affordable, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support these claims. The examples they provide, such as planning a picnic or using a car for official and personal purposes, are not relevant to the prompt.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. The sentence structure is often unclear, making it difficult to follow the student's argument.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing three main reasons for disagreeing with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The essay is written in a clear and coherent manner, with each paragraph focusing on a specific point. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal experiences and examples to support their arguments. For instance, in the first paragraph, the student mentions that traveling with friends allows them to go wherever they want and eat whatever they like, which is a relatable and engaging point. Similarly, in the second paragraph, the student highlights the flexibility of traveling independently, citing the ability to stop and rest when needed.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's opening sentence is vague and does not provide a clear direction for the reader. Additionally, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""bt"" instead of ""by"", ""jounry"" instead of ""journey"", and ""enjioy"" instead of ""enjoy"". These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple sentence structures. For example, the student states that traveling in a group ""just look like working as usual"", which is a vague and unclear statement. The student could have used more descriptive language to convey their point.

Strengths:

- The student has provided a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
- The use of specific examples from the business field, such as the general manager and the financial sector, is effective in supporting the argument.
- The student has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of knowledge in different contexts, highlighting that it is an added asset but also depends on the specific job requirements.

Weaknesses:

- The essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets up the argument more explicitly. The current introduction is somewhat vague and does not provide a clear direction for the reader.
- Some sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, ""My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not"" could be rephrased for clarity.
- The essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the examples provided. While the student has identified the importance of broad knowledge for general managers and specialized knowledge for financial sector employees, they could delve deeper into the implications of these findings.

Suggestions for improvement:

- Provide a clearer introduction that sets up the argument and provides a roadmap for the reader.

The essay provides some relevant reasons and examples to support this claim, including the potential decrease in population and the increasing convenience of public transportation. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use transitional phrases and connecting words, such as ""As I mentioned"" and ""However,"" to link ideas between paragraphs. This helps to create a sense of coherence and flow in the essay.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and concision in some places. For example, the sentence ""One of those inventions is automobile that we use almost everday"" could be rephrased to ""One of the most significant inventions is the automobile, which we use daily."" This would make the writing more concise and clear.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For instance, ""public transportaiton"" should be spelled as ""public transportation,"" and ""injured people like Japan"" is unclear and should be rephrased to ""injured people, such as those in Japan."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the example of Korea's development of elevators is a good start, it could be more effectively integrated into the essay to support the main argument. For instance, the student could explain how the increased availability of elevators has led to a decrease in the use of cars in Korea.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples of community service activities, such as orphanage visits and Amnesty International, which are relevant to the topic. The writer also attempts to address the opposing view by acknowledging that some young people may be lazy and need relaxation time. However, the writer could have explored this idea more thoroughly and provided more nuanced arguments to support their claim.

In terms of grammar and vocabulary, there are several errors that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""As the young generations of children and teenagers continue to display themselves as unique, wild, and crazy"" which is a bit awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the writer uses the phrase ""all in all"" which is a bit informal for an academic essay. The writer also struggles with verb tenses, using both present and past tenses in the same sentence.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, effectively arguing against the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student has provided specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a crucial aspect of the prompt.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge potential counterarguments and address them effectively. For instance, they mention that people often take the actions of a few bad individuals as representative of the entire group, which is a valid point. The student also highlights the changing circumstances of young people's lives, such as increased competition and time constraints, which is a reasonable explanation for their limited availability to help their communities.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and grammar. For example, the sentence ""I personally dont agree with the statement as i feel that young people still play their part in helping their communities"" could be rephrased to ""I personally disagree with the statement because I believe that young people still contribute to helping their communities."" Additionally, some sentences, such as ""A simple example of this is how at the time of someones death everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family which has suffered the loss,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more concrete evidence to support their arguments. While they mention that many young people are involved with NGOs or organizations that help their communities, they could have provided specific examples or statistics to illustrate this point.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer provides some relevant points to support their argument, such as the importance of experimenting with new things and having a creative perspective. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanations, with some sentences being repetitive and vague.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's attempt to use examples to support their argument, such as the idea that trying new things can lead to finding new ways to meet demands beyond common practice. However, these examples are not fully developed and could be more effectively integrated into the essay.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar, with several sentences being awkwardly phrased or containing errors. For example, the sentence ""They try new things that enables them to find a solution that others have not yet found by doing things in common ways"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more specific examples of successful people who have taken risks and tried new things, as well as more concrete evidence to support their claims. This would make the essay more convincing and engaging for the reader.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response is somewhat unclear and lacks a clear stance on the statement. The essay's main argument is that understanding facts is more important than understanding concepts, which contradicts the original statement. The student provides some personal anecdotes and examples to support their claim, but these are not well-integrated into the essay and do not provide strong evidence to support their argument.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps between ideas and sentences without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes throughout the essay, which detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing.

The student does attempt to provide some supporting evidence, such as the example from their human resources class, but this is not fully developed and does not provide a strong argument. The conclusion is also somewhat unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Evaluation:

The student has made a good effort to express their opinion on the given topic, providing three main reasons to support their stance. However, there are several areas where the writing could be improved to demonstrate a higher level of proficiency.

Firstly, the student's introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. It would be beneficial to include a more specific statement that outlines the main arguments to be discussed in the essay. For instance, ""While some people may disagree, I firmly believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years due to several reasons.""

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors that detract from the overall clarity of the writing. For example, ""Because the price oil would get higher"" should be ""Because the price of oil will increase"" or ""Because the price of oil is expected to rise."" Additionally, ""get fewer"" should be ""be fewer"" or ""decrease in number.""

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is a strength of the essay. The example of the transrapid in Munich is a good illustration of alternative transportation methods, and the comparison between the time it takes to travel by car versus bike or subway is a clear and relatable example.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is brief and lacks a final thought or a call to action. It would be beneficial to include a more conclusive statement that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis statement.

The student has demonstrated a clear attempt to address the prompt by providing their personal opinion on the statement. They have also attempted to support their argument with examples, such as the concept of ""genius"" and the benefits of broad knowledge in a well-organized society. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, with ideas and sentences often disconnected from one another. The writing also contains several grammatical errors and simplistic sentence structures, which hinder the overall clarity of the message.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to think critically and reflect on the statement from a personal perspective. They have also demonstrated some understanding of the concept of specialization and its potential drawbacks. However, the essay would benefit from more concrete and specific examples to support their arguments, as well as a clearer structure to guide the reader through their thoughts.

The student's writing style is often informal and conversational, which may be suitable for everyday conversation but not for formal academic writing. Additionally, there are several instances of incomplete sentences and lack of transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, using more complex sentence structures, and providing more specific and concrete examples to support their arguments. They should also strive to maintain a more formal tone and avoid grammatical errors.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the topic, ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity in its argumentation. The writer starts by stating that they disagree with the statement, but the subsequent paragraphs fail to provide a well-supported and logical explanation.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer jumps between different ideas, such as the stress of school, limited freedom, and the need to listen to parents, without connecting them to the main argument. This makes it challenging to follow the writer's line of reasoning.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want"" and ""older people have more freedom."" These statements are not supported by specific examples or evidence, making them less convincing.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and run-on sentences. For example, ""As a young person, I feel like I have very limited life"" should be ""As a young person, I feel like I have very limited life."" Additionally, ""Either there are no free time for them or there are things that is not allowed to young people"" should be ""Either there is no free time for them or there are things that are not allowed for young people.""

The writer attempts to provide some examples, such as the stress of preparing for college and the need to listen to parents. However, these examples are not fully developed and lack specific details to support the argument.

In conclusion, while the writer attempts to address the prompt, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported argument, coherent structure, and proper grammar and punctuation. With some revisions, the writer could improve the essay's overall quality and effectiveness.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support this claim, which is a positive aspect of the writing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Nowdays"" instead of ""Today,"" ""eventhough"" instead of ""although,"" and ""lot's"" instead of ""lots."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of word repetition, such as ""promoted products"" and ""products."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and convoluted, making them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""The promoted product must appeal to the customer and therefore, lot's of technological means are used in order to improve the picture of products"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student's use of examples is a strength, as they provide concrete instances to support their claim. However, the analysis of these examples is not always thorough. For instance, the student mentions that advertisements often use false information, but they do not provide a clear explanation of how this affects the consumer.

In terms of organization, the essay follows a clear structure, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the conclusion could be more concise.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific reasons and examples to support their answer, which is a significant strength of the essay.

One of the notable strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of having broad knowledge, such as the difficulty of learning deeply in multiple subjects and the ease of accessing information. This shows that the student has thoughtfully considered the opposing viewpoint and is not simply presenting a one-sided argument.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary, particularly in the use of transitional phrases and sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""Having broad knowledge seems attractive, but actually, it is not practical after the second thought"" could be rephrased to ""While having broad knowledge may seem appealing at first, it is not a practical choice in reality."" This would improve the clarity and coherence of the writing.

Additionally, the student could provide more concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention the benefits of specializing in a specific subject, they could provide more specific examples of how this would lead to more profound research and greater benefits.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effectively summarized. The final sentence, ""To sum up, generally, I think it is better for one to specialize in certain subject, but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time, which can make the work most effectively,"" feels somewhat abrupt and could be rephrased to more effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. The writer attempts to provide both arguments for and against the statement, but the organization and development of ideas are not always clear.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's effort to provide specific examples, such as the example of globalisation and the role of young people in creating awareness and forming groups to help those in need. However, these examples are not fully developed, and the writer could have benefited from more detailed explanations and supporting evidence.

The writer also struggles with grammar and vocabulary, with numerous errors in sentence structure, verb tense, and word choice. For instance, the sentence ""They get enough time in doing all the other work and for helping for their communities they will run away"" is unclear and contains several grammatical errors. Similarly, the writer uses phrases such as ""we are leaving in a common place"" and ""we could leave as aonecoplete family,"" which are not grammatically correct.

In terms of coherence, the writer jumps between ideas and does not always provide clear transitions between paragraphs. For example, the paragraph that begins ""We cannot also say that young people are not helping their community"" seems to come out of nowhere and could be more effectively integrated into the rest of the essay.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their grammar and vocabulary, as well as developing more coherent and well-supported arguments. With practice and attention to these areas, the writer has the potential to produce a stronger essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the effectiveness of advertisements in making products seem better than they are. However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which significantly hinders the reader's understanding of their argument. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating that advertisements are important, but fails to explicitly address the prompt, which is whether most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. This makes it challenging to follow their line of reasoning.

The student provides two reasons to support their argument: curiosity and the use of famous people in advertisements. However, their explanations are brief and lack concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, when discussing curiosity, they mention that people watch TV every night and are attracted to the shape and color of products in advertisements. While this is a valid point, it is not well-developed and could be strengthened with more specific examples.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and spelling mistakes. For example, ""When I open the TV I can see many different and interesting advertisement"" should be ""When I open the TV, I see many different and interesting advertisements."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

In terms of content, the student's argument is not well-supported by evidence. They mention that their sister bought Coca-Cola because of a famous person in an advertisement, but this is a weak example and does not provide strong evidence to support their claim.

Overall, while the student has attempted to address the prompt, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of coherence, clarity, and grammatical accuracy.

Firstly, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as ""bucause"" instead of ""because,"" ""learm"" instead of ""learn,"" and ""It is not good for young students"" instead of ""I think it is not good for young students."" These errors detract from the overall coherence of the essay and make it challenging to follow the student's train of thought.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning or concrete examples. While they mention a few instances, such as the Japanese education system, these are not adequately developed or connected to the main argument. The student also jumps between ideas, such as discussing the importance of imagination and the Japanese education system, without providing a clear link between them.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. They make sweeping statements, such as ""It will makes them more intelligent and interested person,"" without providing evidence or explanation. This lack of depth and nuance makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.

However, the essay demonstrates several areas that require improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and logical flow. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the ideas are not well-connected. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the appeal of famous people in advertisements to presenting a survey conducted by a Korean newspaper. 

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the clarity and effectiveness of their writing. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect word choices. For example, ""famouse"" should be ""famous,"" ""usally"" should be ""usually,"" and ""quailified"" should be ""qualified."" 

Thirdly, the student's use of examples to support their arguments is somewhat superficial. While they provide a personal anecdote about a friend's experience with a tape player, the example is not well-developed, and the connection to the main argument is not clear. Similarly, the example about the toy is not well-supported, and the student's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. They rely heavily on general statements and surveys without providing a nuanced understanding of the issue.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The essay provides some relevant examples, such as Bill Gates' success in the computer industry, to support the argument. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues is the lack of coherence and clarity in the essay structure. The student jumps between ideas without a clear logical connection, making it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the transition from the example of Bill Gates to the general statement about successful people's mindset is abrupt. Additionally, the student uses simplistic sentence structures and vocabulary, which may not effectively convey the complexity of the topic.

Furthermore, the student's use of phrases such as ""In my observation from the successful businessmen or professors"" and ""In contast"" (should be ""In contrast"") indicates a need for improvement in grammar and sentence-level accuracy.

The essay provides several examples to support this claim, including the stories of Bill Gates, astronauts, businesspeople, Kevin Pietersen, and Sir Edmund Hillary. These examples are relevant and help to illustrate the point that taking calculated risks is essential for achieving success.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The opening sentence is somewhat vague and does not effectively grab the reader's attention. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite short and lack cohesion, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

Furthermore, while the examples provided are interesting and relevant, they could be more effectively integrated into the essay. For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing business and the stock market to talking about Kevin Pietersen, without providing a clear connection between the two. Similarly, the story of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay is introduced without any clear link to the main argument.

In terms of language, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the sentence ""there is risk involved in many the things people do"" should be ""there is risk involved in many things that people do."" Additionally, some of the vocabulary is not used correctly, such as ""elegant"" to describe a cricket player.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples, such as the story of Larry Page and Sergej Brin, and the comparison between safe and risky investments in stock brokering. These examples help to make the argument more convincing and engaging for the reader.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer could have provided more nuanced and detailed explanations of the risks involved in taking new things and trying new ideas. For example, while the writer mentions the risk of losing a job or health, they could have explored the emotional and psychological aspects of taking risks, such as fear, anxiety, and self-doubt.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claim that ""nothing is secure"" and that success often requires hard work. While this statement is generally true, it would be more convincing if the writer had provided more specific examples or statistics to back it up.

Finally, the writer could have benefited from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. While the writing is clear and easy to understand, it is sometimes repetitive and lacks precision.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a clear and concise thesis statement, which is well-supported by examples from various fields, such as science and academia. The writer has also demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of specialization and its limitations. The use of phrases like ""extremes are never the best solution"" and ""a combination of these two types"" shows a good command of idiomatic expressions.

However, there are several areas where the student could improve their writing.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples and reasons to support their opinion. For instance, they mention the importance of investing in public transportation, improving infrastructure, and developing alternative sources of energy. These are all relevant points that demonstrate the student's understanding of the topic.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the student's writing is often fragmented and lacks coherence. For example, the sentence ""I believe that we will all benefit from the lack of cars but we need to get used to other means of transport"" is a good starting point, but the following sentences do not flow logically from this idea. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of public transportation to mentioning the need to invest in research and development.

Additionally, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""As nowadays cars are the biggest source of pollution, it will be positive for the environment and for all of us"" is a good point, but the use of ""as"" instead of ""since"" is incorrect. Similarly, the phrase ""we might run out of petroleum, and this will probably be the main cause for fewer cars"" is a good point, but the use of ""for"" instead of ""of"" is incorrect.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. For example, instead of saying ""it will be difficult to live without cars,"" the student could say ""the prospect of a car-free future may be daunting.""

The student starts by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the potential influence of group thinking, which is a good attempt to demonstrate critical thinking.

The student then attempts to provide reasons why young people might enjoy life more, citing their active bodies and minds, and the fact that they are working hard to prepare for their future. However, these points are not well-supported and lack concrete evidence. The student also makes a sweeping generalization that young people are doing more than older people, which is not necessarily true.

The student's argument is further weakened by the inclusion of irrelevant points, such as the fact that older people may spend their time watching TV or playing poker. While this may be true for some older people, it is not representative of the entire older generation.

The student also makes a valid point about the changing job market and the need for young people to be well-prepared to secure employment. However, this point is not directly related to the question of whether young people enjoy life more than older people.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""everybodies,"" ""peolple,"" and ""preperated."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing some reasons and examples to support their opinion. However, there are several areas that require improvement. 

Firstly, the introduction is somewhat unclear and lacks a direct response to the prompt. The student starts by stating that traveling is a part of living, which is not directly related to the prompt. A more effective introduction would have started with a clear statement agreeing or disagreeing with the prompt and then providing supporting reasons.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""FirsfThe reason why people are willing to travel is to be open to other cultures and traditions,"" which should be ""Firstly, the reason why people are willing to travel is to be open to other cultures and traditions."" Additionally, there are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, such as ""we usually need someone to lead us otherwise we'll get lost and be deceived,"" which should be ""we usually need someone to lead us, otherwise we will get lost and be deceived.""

Thirdly, the student's arguments are not well-organized and lack coherence. The transition between ideas is not smooth, and the student jumps abruptly from discussing the need for a tour guide to the benefits of traveling in groups. A more effective essay would have had a clear structure, with each paragraph focusing on a specific point.

Lastly, the conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The student simply restates their opinion without providing a final thought or a call to action.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey the writer's argument. 

Firstly, the writer attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but the examples are not well-integrated into the essay. The mention of Samsung and its owner's quote is a good start, but it is not fully utilized to support the argument. The writer could have explored the quote further and explained how it relates to the idea of trying new things and taking risks.

Secondly, the writer's writing style is often unclear and lacks coherence. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""surcumstance"" instead of ""circumstance,"" ""sucessful"" instead of ""successful,"" and ""ane"" instead of ""an."" The writer also struggles with sentence structure, resulting in awkward phrasing and unclear meaning.

Thirdly, the writer's ideas are not fully developed. The writer mentions that successful people want a stable life and may not want to take risks, but this idea is not fully explored. The writer also mentions that failure can be an experience for approaching life, but this idea is not clearly connected to the main argument.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The writer simply restates their opinion without providing a clear summary of the evidence presented.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay with a clear thesis statement. The essay is divided into logical paragraphs, each addressing a specific point in support of the argument. The student has also used a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures, which is commendable for a second language learner.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more precise and concise language. Some sentences are wordy and contain unnecessary phrases, which can make the text harder to follow. For instance, the sentence ""I think it highly depends on the character of a person"" could be rephrased as ""The success of trying new things and taking risks depends on an individual's character."" Additionally, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments, rather than relying on general statements.

The student's use of transitional phrases and linking words is also limited, which can make the essay feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, the transition from the first to the second paragraph is abrupt, and the student could have used a phrase like ""On the other hand"" or ""However"" to connect the ideas more smoothly.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly related to the thesis statement. The final sentence, ""Despite all these arguments on success, I, as to speak for myself, would prefer learning new things and according to that I would also be willing to take some risks,"" feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts. However, their essay is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to provide examples from various professions, such as lawyers and historians, to support their claim. They also make a valid point about the importance of research and understanding ideas and concepts in driving progress in society. The example of the improvement in telecommunications is a good illustration of how understanding ideas and concepts can lead to innovation.

However, the essay is weakened by several areas. Firstly, the student's writing is often unclear and difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, such as ""Facts can be research by student,"" ""several ways to support the statement that is more important understan ideas and concepts,"" and ""knoledge adquired at a law school is to think logically."" These errors make it challenging for the reader to understand the student's intended meaning.

Additionally, the student's examples are not always well-developed or relevant to the topic. For instance, the comparison between the Menonites and society is unclear and seems out of place in the essay. Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis, with many of their points feeling superficial or unsupported by evidence.

Finally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with many words being misspelled or used incorrectly. For example, ""knoledge"" instead of ""knowledge,"" ""sucesfull"" instead of ""successful,"" and ""tecnology"" instead of ""technology.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The essay is well-structured, with an introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the essay, a body that provides specific examples, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a personal anecdote to support the argument. The student recounts a personal experience of buying an apple pie that was advertised on TV but turned out to be of poor quality. This example is relatable and helps to illustrate the point that advertisements can be misleading.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""tecniques"" instead of ""techniques"" and ""budjet"" instead of ""budget."" Additionally, the sentence structure is sometimes awkward, with phrases such as ""I couldn't sleep all night long"" feeling a bit disconnected from the rest of the paragraph.

The student also struggles with vocabulary, using words like ""irresistible"" and ""realy"" (which should be ""really"") in a way that feels a bit forced. Furthermore, the transition between ideas could be smoother, with some sentences feeling a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student shows a good understanding of the topic and is able to provide some thoughtful insights into the relationship between advertisements and product quality. The suggestion that companies should invest in quality certification is a good one, and the student's conclusion is clear and concise.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, agreeing that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years due to the convenience of public transportation and growing environmental concerns. The essay provides some valid points, such as the cost-effectiveness and time-saving benefits of public transportation, as well as the increasing awareness about the importance of preserving the environment. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples, such as the benefits of using subways and the efforts of environmentalists to raise awareness about global warming. These examples help to support the student's argument and make the essay more engaging.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks cohesion and coherence, with some sentences feeling disconnected from the rest of the essay. For example, the transition between the two main reasons (public transportation and environmental concerns) is abrupt, and the student could have used more connecting words or phrases to link the ideas together.

Additionally, the student's grammar and spelling errors are quite frequent, which can make the essay difficult to understand at times. For instance, the student writes ""than there are today"" instead of ""than there are today's"" (subject-verb agreement error), and ""poeple"" instead of ""people"" (spelling error). These errors can be distracting and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion could be more effective. While the student reiterates the main points, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more thought-provoking. The student could have ended the essay with a stronger statement or a call to action to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

The essay attempts to address the prompt by providing three reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people. However, there are several areas that need improvement to make the essay more effective and coherent.

Firstly, the essay starts with a vague statement about World War 2, which is not directly related to the topic. It would be better to begin with a clear statement of agreement or disagreement with the prompt. Additionally, the use of ""Would-be Baby-boom generation"" is unclear and may confuse the reader.

The essay's organization is somewhat haphazard, with each paragraph addressing a different reason. While the reasons provided are somewhat relevant, they lack depth and supporting evidence. For instance, the statement that young people know well how to play and have fun is not adequately explained, and the example of the expensive jewelry brand is not a convincing reason for why young people enjoy life more.

The second paragraph attempts to explain that young people are healthier than older people, but this is not necessarily true. While it is true that young people may not have to pay for medical care, this is not a reason for enjoying life more. In fact, older people may have more life experience and wisdom, which can contribute to a more fulfilling life.

The third paragraph attempts to explain that young people are curious and open-minded, but the example provided is somewhat contrived and not well-supported. The statement that young people will try to talk to a stranger from another country is not necessarily true, and the example of a tourist visiting a small town is not a convincing illustration of this point.

In terms of language, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay. For instance, ""They, Would-be Baby-boom generation"" should be ""They, the Baby-boom generation,"" and ""They just maintain thier living cost"" should be ""They just maintain their living costs."" Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions such as ""go the best club in Soho"" is not suitable for an academic essay.

Overall, while the essay attempts to address the prompt, it lacks coherence, depth, and supporting evidence. With more attention to organization, language, and supporting examples, the essay could be more effective in convincing the reader of the writer's argument.

- The use of examples from various fields, such as business and art, demonstrates a broad understanding of the topic.
- The student attempts to address potential counterarguments, such as the importance of learning from failures, which shows a critical thinking approach.

- Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, which may affect the overall clarity of the essay.

Evaluation:
The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given prompt, agreeing with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The essay provides two main reasons to support this stance: (1) successful people's experiences and inventions take time to improve, and (2) new inventions can lead to the creation of related new products. The student uses the example of Edison and the invention of light to illustrate the first point, and the relationship between electricity and light to demonstrate the second point.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, particularly in the transition between paragraphs. The sentences are often disconnected, and the ideas are not fully developed. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing Edison's invention to mentioning the relationship between electricity and light. Additionally, the student uses several grammatical errors, such as ""So different are the personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse culture"" (should be ""So different are the personal experiences and emotions among people with diverse cultures""), ""one of the central reasons that can be presented my position"" (should be ""one of the central reasons that can be presented in my position""), and ""sperical cases"" (should be ""specific cases"").

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and the language is often simplistic. For example, the student uses the phrase ""come out"" instead of ""emerge"" or ""appear,"" and ""make lists of new things"" instead of ""create a series of new inventions.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use specific examples to illustrate their points. For instance, they mention that traveling with a group can be boring and restrictive, and that they prefer to plan their own itinerary. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors and typos, which can make it difficult to understand their intended meaning. For example, ""Travilling"" should be ""Traveling,"" ""fallow"" should be ""follow,"" and ""resricted"" should be ""restricted.""

However, their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and a lack of transitional phrases to connect ideas.

One of the major issues with the essay is the use of simplistic and vague statements, such as ""I dont think all of the young people nowadays are helping their communities but i believe some of them do helping.""

Firstly, the student has provided a good introduction by acknowledging that everyone has different opinions on the topic. However, the transition to the main argument could be smoother. The student jumps abruptly from stating that some people think traveling alone is better to stating their own opinion that traveling with a tour guide is better. A more logical connection between the two ideas would strengthen the essay.

In terms of content, the student has provided three main reasons to support their argument: saving time, saving money, and being more efficient. However, the examples provided are somewhat vague and lack specific details. For instance, the student mentions that a tour guide can save time by leading them to interesting places, but they do not provide any concrete examples of what these places are or why they are interesting. Similarly, the student mentions that a tour guide can save money by booking rooms at a lower price, but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""Let us image, we walk in a fablous city"" should be ""Let us imagine walking in a fabulous city.""

For example, ""The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is may right"" should be ""The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is maybe right.""
- Sentence structure is often simplistic, with a lack of variety in sentence length and complexity. For example, ""I think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversince"" could be rephrased as ""I believe that the period between childhood and adulthood has always been a challenging time.""
- Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, such as ""But even most middel-age and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens."" could be rephrased as ""However, even middle-aged and older people often turn a blind eye to uncomfortable situations.""
- The writer could benefit from using more precise vocabulary to convey their ideas. For example, ""realy ignorrant"" should be ""really ignorant.""

1.  The student has attempted to engage the reader with a thought-provoking opening sentence, referencing the phrase ""On the move.""
2.  The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
3.  The student has provided some relevant examples, such as the improvement in living conditions and the focus on science and technology, to support their argument.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the topic. The student's opinion is stated in the introduction, but it is not explicitly linked to the topic.
2.  The supporting reasons are not fully developed, and some sentences are disconnected from the main argument. For example, the discussion on nomads and shifting agriculture seems unrelated to the topic.
3.  The student uses some complex vocabulary, but there are instances of incorrect word choice (e.g., ""pesipicuous,"" ""inclinated,"" ""manifold increase"") and grammatical errors (e.g., ""The automative industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man has invented the wheel"").
4.  The conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the introduction to include a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the topic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively expressing their opinion that traveling alone is the best way to travel. They provide two main reasons to support their argument: the comfort and freedom that comes with solo travel. 

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student has attempted to use transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""To begin with"" and ""Also.""
- They have provided personal anecdotes to support their claims, which adds a level of authenticity to their writing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided some relevant examples to support their argument. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has attempted to address both sides of the issue, discussing the importance of trying new things and taking risks, as well as the potential costs associated with these actions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of historical examples, such as Christopher Columbus, to illustrate the significance of taking risks and trying new things. The writer also provides a clear and concise thesis statement, which is well-supported by the body paragraphs.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary, as well as more complex sentence structures. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""If we were born just to do the same life, the same job and the same experiences of the peple lived before us, problably the humanity would still live in the caves"" could be rephrased for better grammar and clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their argument. While the examples provided are relevant, they are somewhat general and lack depth. For instance, the writer mentions that ""a lot of people died trying to develop aircrafts,"" but does not provide specific details about who these people were or what exactly they did.

Finally, the writer could have provided a more nuanced conclusion that ties together the main points of the essay. The current conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not leave the reader with a lasting impression.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer provides two personal anecdotes and a historical example to support their argument, which is a good start. However, the writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of cohesion between paragraphs.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal experiences to illustrate their point. The story about the writer's father and Thomas Edison's perseverance in the face of adversity is engaging and relevant to the topic. However, the writer could have benefited from more nuanced and detailed explanations of these examples. For instance, the writer could have elaborated on the specific challenges their father faced in his business and how he overcame them.

The writer also struggles with grammar and vocabulary. There are numerous errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure. For example, ""I can't to do everything"" should be ""I couldn't do everything,"" and ""I will write about reason why"" should be ""I will explain why."" Additionally, the writer uses simplistic vocabulary, such as ""wonderring"" instead of ""wondering"" and ""solutuion"" instead of ""solution.""

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from more transitional phrases to connect their ideas between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from the writer's personal experience to the story of Thomas Edison, and then to a conclusion. A more logical flow of ideas would have made the essay more cohesive and easier to follow.

In terms of content, the writer's argument is clear, but it could be more sophisticated. The writer states that successful people try new things and take risks, but they could have explored the implications of this statement further. For example, they could have discussed the potential risks and challenges associated with trying new things and how successful people mitigate these risks.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear and well-structured argument in support of the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The essay is well-organized, and the writer effectively uses various examples from different fields, such as business, entertainment, sports, and politics, to illustrate the importance of taking risks and trying new things.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific and relevant examples to support the argument. The writer provides a clear analysis of the consequences of not taking risks, citing the example of traditional telephone companies and media businesses that failed to adapt to changing technology. This example is particularly effective in highlighting the importance of innovation and risk-taking in staying relevant in a rapidly changing world.

The writer also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of evolution and how it relates to the idea of taking risks and trying new things. The example of Bill Gates and Michael Dell is a good illustration of how taking risks and experimenting with new ideas can lead to significant rewards.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. At times, the language and sentence structure can be a bit simplistic, which may not be suitable for a high-level essay. For example, the sentence ""Human beings are loath to change and do not like to get out of their 'comfort zone'"" could be rephrased for more complexity and nuance. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the writer could provide more depth and analysis of the examples provided.

Evaluation:
The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide their opinion on the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, with several grammatical errors and incorrect sentence structures. For instance, the first sentence ""Is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide?"" should be rephrased to ""Is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide?"" to correct the subject-verb agreement. Additionally, the use of ""there are going to be millions of places that you may have not seen or never heard before"" is a vague statement and could be more specific.

The student attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their answer, but they are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence. For example, when discussing the benefits of traveling with a tour guide, the student mentions that it's a good choice if you want to learn about the history behind a city. However, they fail to provide specific examples or details to support this claim.

Furthermore, the student's personal experiences and opinions are not well-integrated into the essay. The transition between ideas is abrupt, and the student jumps between different topics without connecting them logically. For instance, the shift from discussing the benefits of traveling with a tour guide to the student's personal preferences and future plans is not smooth.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and attempts to consider different perspectives. They acknowledge that traveling with a tour guide can be beneficial for learning about a city's history and culture, but also recognize that it may not be the best choice for everyone.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing a preference for traveling in a group led by a tour guide. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has provided several reasons to support their opinion, including the convenience of a pre-planned itinerary, the opportunity to meet new people, and the guidance provided by the tour leader.

However, there are some areas that require improvement. The student's writing is often simplistic, with a limited range of vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, the phrase ""it takes care of my spendings"" could be rephrased as ""it helps me budget my expenses effectively."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For instance, the sentence ""I could be more involved in the group while travelling which would help me in communicating to a variety of people and enhance my knowlegde horizon socially as well as give me a chance to learn about different minds"" could be broken down into two separate sentences for easier understanding.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed examples to support their arguments. For example, they mention that a tour guide helps with time management, but they could have elaborated on how this is beneficial in a specific situation. Similarly, they mention that a tour guide helps with personal safety, but they could have provided a concrete example of a situation where this was particularly useful.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt and provide their opinion on the statement. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is clear, but it is a direct negation of the given statement without providing a nuanced argument. A more effective approach would be to provide a balanced argument that acknowledges the potential exaggerations in advertisements while also highlighting their positive aspects. 

The student provides two examples to support their argument, but they are not well-integrated into the essay. The examples are also not thoroughly analyzed, and the student fails to provide specific details about the advertisements and the products. For instance, the student mentions the Nokia portable phone and the iPod, but does not provide any specific information about the advertisements or how they were misleading.

The student also introduces a new idea that people get bored with products after using them, which is not directly related to the original statement. This idea could be explored further, but it would require more development and connection to the main argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is often unclear and lacks coherence. There are several grammatical errors, and the sentence structure is not always logical. For example, the sentence ""When people actually bought the product, what they actually saw was a reallity"" should be ""When people actually bought the product, what they actually saw was reality.""

The student also fails to address the potential exaggerations in advertisements, which is the core of the original statement. They argue that advertisements show what the real product is and do not exaggerate, which is not supported by evidence.

Finally, the student's conclusion is abrupt and does not summarize the main points effectively. They also introduce a new idea about people understanding advertisements incorrectly, which is not developed further.

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts with a clear opinion, but the supporting reasons are not well-organized and lack specific examples. The student jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the transition from the first reason (having broad knowledge for future job opportunities) to the second reason (making good relationships with others) is abrupt. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect these ideas more smoothly.

Secondly, the student's writing contains grammatical and spelling errors, which affect the overall readability of the essay. For example, ""in my opinion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subejcts"" should be ""in my opinion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects."" Similarly, ""he knoews"" should be ""he knows."" These errors detract from the student's message and make it harder for the reader to understand their points.

Thirdly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they could benefit from more varied and precise language. For instance, instead of using ""so many people,"" the student could have used ""numerous individuals"" or ""a diverse group of people."" This would have added more depth and nuance to their writing.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They mention that specializing in one subject will limit job and relationship opportunities, but this is not a strong argument against the original statement. A more effective conclusion would have summarized the main points and re-emphasized their opinion.

3. The student has demonstrated some awareness of the environmental impact of cars, mentioning pollution as a consequence of increased car usage.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and examples presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. For example, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the government's efforts to reduce the number of cars to talking about the effectiveness of public transportation in other countries.
2. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""As more and more cars are rapidly produced today, the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportations throughout a nation"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on road, which also could cause pollutions"" (verb tense inconsistency).
3. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""hundred of metres tall"" and ""wannabe drivers"" being awkward and unclear.

The student has made a clear attempt to express their opinion on the given prompt, but their writing requires improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the student's line of thought. For instance, the student starts by stating that students with broad knowledge are more open-minded and have higher success rates, but then shifts to discussing the benefits of having multiple degrees in a job setting. A more logical connection between these ideas would strengthen the essay.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, which affects the overall quality of the writing. There are several spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, such as ""guadrated"" instead of ""graded"" and ""opporturnity"" instead of ""opportunity."" Additionally, the student uses simple sentence structures and lacks variety in sentence length, making the writing seem flat.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples is somewhat superficial. While the example of a student with multiple degrees being more valuable to a company is a good start, it could be developed further to provide more concrete evidence. The student also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""the higher degree the student has, the student would requires higher wages and more power in the company,"" without providing specific examples or supporting evidence.

Lastly, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance in their analysis. The student's conclusion that ""more the knowledge you have, the more life you get"" is a vague statement that could be supported with more specific examples or evidence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their agreement with the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, their essay requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their thoughts and ideas.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided some relevant points in support of their argument, such as the benefits of having a tour guide in terms of knowledge about the places, planning schedules, and saving money.
2. They have attempted to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, which is a good effort for a second language learner.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks coherence and clarity, with many grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structures, and missing articles. For example, ""The great oppourtinity to go to some different places comes"" should be ""The great opportunity to visit different places comes.""
2. The student has not fully developed their ideas, and some points are not well-supported. For instance, the statement ""he is having lack of experiance in travelling and in demonistration different places"" is unclear and lacks context.
3. The essay lacks specific examples and details to make the arguments more convincing. For example, the student mentions that a tour guide knows ""myriad collection for the historic events,"" but does not provide any specific examples.
4. The student has not addressed potential counterarguments or considered alternative perspectives, which is an essential aspect of a well-rounded essay.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Revise the essay to improve grammar, sentence structure, and clarity.
2. Develop ideas more fully and provide specific examples to support arguments.
3. Address potential counterarguments and consider alternative perspectives.
4. Use transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas more effectively.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing two main reasons why they agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The sentences are often fragmented and lack proper connections between ideas. For instance, the first sentence ""Today, many advertisements are making much products"" is unclear and does not make sense. The student seems to be trying to say that many advertisements are making products, but the phrase ""making much products"" is ambiguous. A clearer sentence would be ""Many advertisements are promoting products.""

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""The bubble what am I talking about is"" should be ""The bubble I am talking about is."" Additionally, ""they are entertaining themselves so they can show their appearance to people"" is a convoluted sentence that could be rephrased for better clarity.

Thirdly, the student's examples are not well-supported and lack specific details. For instance, the student mentions that advertisements use ""commer shows"" and ""entertainment"" to make products seem better, but does not provide any concrete examples or evidence to back up this claim.

Lastly, the student's conclusion is unclear and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student seems to be saying that advertisements are a necessary part of the economy, but this conclusion is not well-supported and feels tacked on.

Strengths of the essay include:

- The student has attempted to use examples to support their arguments, such as the example of visiting a tourist attraction in a group and not being able to see it well due to time constraints.
- The student has also demonstrated an understanding of the potential benefits of traveling alone, including meeting local people, learning about local traditions and cultures, and gaining independence.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing their opinion on the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" However, their response is marred by several issues that hinder the effectiveness of their argument. 

Firstly, the student's introduction is unclear and does not directly address the prompt. They mention that the statement ""doesn't consider the reality,"" but fail to explain what specific aspects of reality they are referring to. This lack of clarity sets the tone for the rest of the essay, which meanders through various unrelated points.

The student attempts to provide reasons for their opinion, but these reasons are often disconnected and lack concrete evidence. For instance, they mention that ""medication in this year saves thousands of people in the world,"" but do not provide any specific statistics or examples to support this claim. Similarly, their discussion of ""freedom of opportunities"" and the provision of food and medication by the USA and other countries is not directly linked to the use of cars.

The student's argument is also weakened by their failure to address the potential counterarguments to their position. They do not consider the possibility that increased population and economic growth might lead to increased traffic congestion, pollution, and other factors that could reduce the number of cars in use.

On the other hand, the student does attempt to provide some logical reasoning, such as the decreasing cost of cars due to technological advancements and the increasing comfort of car travel. However, these points are not fully developed and lack concrete evidence to support them.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement and offering some supporting reasons. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. The student jumps from discussing the problem of oil dependency to introducing a new generation of car technology without a clear link between the two ideas. 

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate. For example, the phrase ""then they are today"" should be ""than they are today,"" and ""otto-motor"" should be ""Otto engine."" Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""elctric one"" instead of ""electric one,"" which indicates a lack of attention to detail.

The student also attempts to provide examples to support their argument, but they are not well-developed. The example of China is an interesting one, but it is not fully explored. The student mentions that China is increasing, but they do not explain how this relates to the statement about fewer cars in use in twenty years.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They mention that it will be more important to give money for research in the future, but this does not directly relate to the statement they are disagreeing with.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the given topic, but their writing contains several areas that need improvement. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The essay is composed of short, disconnected sentences that make it challenging to follow their train of thought. For instance, the first sentence, ""I disagree.I have three opinion to support this reason,"" is unclear and seems to be a mix of a statement and a transition. The student could have started with a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Secondly, the student's vocabulary and grammar are limited, which affects the overall quality of the essay. Phrases such as ""not free to active"" and ""scasuling"" are not grammatically correct and make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Additionally, the student uses simple sentence structures, which can make the writing seem flat and unengaging.

Thirdly, the student's use of examples to support their arguments is limited. While they mention a few points, such as being unable to stay at a place for as long as they want and being able to make local friends, these points are not fully developed. The student could have provided more specific examples or elaborated on these points to make their arguments more convincing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the given topic, providing three main reasons to support their argument that there will be fewer cars in use in the future. The essay structure is generally clear, with each reason presented as a separate paragraph. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""There are discussion,"" instead of ""There are discussions,"" and ""some people thinks"" instead of ""some people think."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the essay. Additionally, the student often uses simple sentence structures, which can make the writing seem flat and unengaging.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with phrases such as ""the most thing to not improve"" and ""outweigh to find other oil"" being unclear and unnatural. The student also relies heavily on clichéd expressions, such as ""no doubt in my mind,"" which can make the writing seem less original.

Thirdly, the student's analysis of the topic is somewhat superficial. While they mention the problems of oil depletion and air pollution, they do not provide a nuanced exploration of these issues. For example, they do not discuss the potential consequences of oil depletion in detail or the various ways in which air pollution can be mitigated.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt, with a summary of the main points without a clear final thought or call to action. To strengthen the essay, the student could provide a more detailed analysis of the topic and a more sophisticated conclusion.

Firstly, the introduction could be more effective in grabbing the reader's attention. The phrase ""Recently this issue has been brought into focus and aroused a fierce public debate"" is a bit generic and does not provide any specific context or insight into the topic. A more engaging opening sentence could be used to draw the reader in.

Secondly, the essay could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the drawbacks of advertisements to the benefits, and then back to the drawbacks. A clearer transition between paragraphs would improve the flow of the essay.

Thirdly, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as ""corlorful,"" ""reallly,"" ""extraggrately,"" ""perchased,"" ""benifits,"" and ""processions."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

Fourthly, the writer could provide more specific and concrete examples to support their arguments. While the examples given are relevant, they are not fully developed and could be expanded upon.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear thesis statement that addresses the topic. The essay is well-structured, with an introduction that sets the context, a body that presents arguments, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to define success and its relation to taking risks and trying new things. The student provides a clear definition of success from an economic perspective and uses the example of franchising to illustrate the trade-offs between established and new products. The student also acknowledges the limitations of their perspective and the importance of considering other aspects of success.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and fewer grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value"" should be ""Success is normally a well-constructed and established value."" Additionally, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments, such as specific instances of successful people who have taken risks and failed, or examples of successful companies that have innovated and taken risks.

The student's conclusion is clear and concise, but it could be more effective if it were more directly linked to the thesis statement. The student could have summarized the main points more explicitly and re-emphasized the importance of taking risks and trying new things.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and coherent paragraphs. The student provides three main reasons to support their argument, which are: understanding ideas helps to comprehend facts, learning facts is easier than understanding ideas, and understanding ideas fosters critical thinking and reflection.

Strengths of the essay include:

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has provided some relevant points to support their argument. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has attempted to address the prompt directly and has provided some specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention that advertisements show the strengths of a product without revealing its weaknesses, which is a valid point. Additionally, they argue that companies want to satisfy customers and would not intentionally show false advertisements, which is a reasonable assumption.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing falls short. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's argument is somewhat unclear, and it is not until the final sentence that they explicitly state their position on the topic.

Furthermore, the student's writing is often vague and lacks specific examples to support their claims. For example, when discussing the goals of advertisements, the student states that they are used to support the selling process, but does not provide any concrete evidence to back this up. Similarly, when discussing the potential consequences of false advertisements, the student mentions that people would recognize a lie, but does not provide any specific examples or statistics to support this claim.

Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, the sentence ""As I mentioned before, the customer should have a positive impression from the product"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points.

The essay provides some specific examples to support the argument, including the use of warning messages in tobacco advertisements and the unique strategy employed by Yukiguni-maitake to attract consumers. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing advertisements that discourage people from purchasing products to mentioning a company that uses a unique strategy to attract consumers. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay could benefit from a clearer structure.

Another area of concern is the use of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several errors in verb tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, and sentence formation. For instance, the student uses both ""has existed"" and ""has existed for as long as"" in the first sentence, which creates a sense of confusion. Additionally, the use of phrases such as ""To illustrate"" and ""In view of this"" feels somewhat awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the advertisements they mentioned. For example, they could have explored the impact of the warning messages in tobacco advertisements or the effectiveness of Yukiguni-maitake's unique strategy in a more in-depth manner.

However, the essay is marred by several grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing.

One of the major strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use specific examples to support their argument. For instance, the student mentions that their young sister has a busy schedule with extra study sessions after school, which leaves her with little time to engage with her community. This example is relevant to the topic and helps to illustrate the student's point.

However, the essay is also plagued by several weaknesses. Firstly, the student's writing is often unclear and difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of verb tenses. For example, the sentence ""Nowaday, ours family is going to smaller than what we have before"" is unclear and should be rephrased to ""Our family is getting smaller than it was before."" Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words such as ""familiy"" and ""thay"" being used instead of ""family"" and ""they.""

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported and lacks depth. The student simply states that young people do not have time to help their communities because they are busy, but does not provide any concrete evidence or analysis to back up this claim. The student also fails to consider alternative perspectives or counterarguments, which would strengthen their argument and make it more convincing.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student has failed to provide a clear and concise thesis statement that directly addresses the prompt. The essay meanders between discussing the benefits of having one guide and the potential drawbacks of having multiple guides, but it does not effectively tie these ideas together to form a cohesive argument.

Secondly, the student's use of examples is limited and lacks depth. The comparison of a group with one guide to a single heart is an interesting analogy, but it is not well-explained or supported with evidence. The example of a group following multiple guides is also unclear and does not effectively illustrate the point being made.

Thirdly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""his group to follow him necessarily"" instead of ""his group necessarily follows him."" Additionally, the sentence ""If travelers depend on one guide in their tour, it, even if tall, will be more successful than if they choose to follow many guiders"" is confusing and lacks coherence.

Lastly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentence structures.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. They provide several reasons to support their argument, including the difficulty of understanding ideas due to differences in perspectives, the potential for ideas to be manipulated, and the importance of facts in understanding concepts. However, their writing is marred by several issues that detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and organization in the essay. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the first paragraph starts with a statement that is opposite to the main argument, which is later clarified in the subsequent paragraphs. This lack of coherence makes it challenging to follow the student's train of thought.

Another issue is the use of simplistic and sometimes inaccurate language. Phrases such as ""it is very difficult to understand ideas and concepts and it is simpler and faster to learn facts"" and ""Ideas have to be supported by fact!"" demonstrate a lack of nuance and sophistication in the student's writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and incorrect word order.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and provides relevant examples to support their argument. The use of historical and scientific examples, such as the Holocaust and biology, shows that the student has some knowledge of the subject matter. However, the analysis of these examples is not particularly deep or insightful.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clearer and more logical structure, using more sophisticated language, and addressing the grammatical errors. They should also provide more nuanced and detailed analysis of the examples they use to support their argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. However, their essay lacks coherence and logical flow, making it challenging to follow their arguments. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student presents three reasons to support their disagreement, but these reasons are not well-integrated into a cohesive argument. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the student jumps between ideas without providing a clear connection between them.

In terms of content, the student's arguments are not well-supported. The first reason, regarding the reduction of pollution, is based on the assumption that cars will switch to electric power, but this is not a guarantee. The second reason, focusing on the comfort and convenience of driving, is subjective and does not address the topic directly. The third reason, about showing status, is based on a narrow perspective and may not be applicable to everyone.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""We all know that cars can represent ones status"" (should be ""one's""), ""Teconology"" (should be ""technology""), ""enviroments"" (should be ""environments""), and ""the air will goes fresh"" (should be ""the air will become fresher"").

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For instance, the third reason mentioned is ""More people, more fun,"" which seems disconnected from the previous points. Additionally, the student fails to provide concrete evidence to support some of their claims, such as the statement that tourists get married after a long tour.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""i"" instead of ""I,"" ""noticably"" instead of ""noticeably,"" and ""in order to have a real vacation"" instead of ""to have a real vacation."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

Lastly, the conclusion is somewhat repetitive, reiterating the student's initial statement without providing a clear summary of the main points.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear stance on the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to demonstrate a more coherent and well-structured argument.

Strengths:

1.  The student has provided a clear thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, stating their disagreement with the statement.
2.  They have used examples from real-life situations, such as college students going on a picnic, to support their argument.
3.  The student has attempted to address the potential benefits of having a tour guide, such as avoiding problems during travel.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and sentences often disconnected and lacking transitions.
2.  The student has not provided sufficient evidence to support their argument, relying on vague statements and examples that are not well-explained.
3.  There are numerous grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing.
4.  The student has not fully addressed the potential benefits of traveling in a group led by a tour guide, instead focusing primarily on the drawbacks.
5.  The conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer provides examples, such as Bill Gates, to support their argument. However, the essay has several areas that require improvement.

Firstly, the writer's language and grammar skills need refinement. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. For instance, ""succeful"" instead of ""successful,"" ""explote"" instead of ""exploit,"" and ""at days"" instead of ""these days"" are just a few examples. Additionally, the writer often uses simplistic sentence structures, which can make the writing seem less engaging and less sophisticated.

Secondly, the writer's organization and coherence could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the definition of ""successful"" to providing examples of successful people who take risks. A clearer transition between these ideas would help the writer's argument flow more smoothly. Furthermore, some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the essay, such as ""For example Bill Gates, he was a man that one day woke up and decided to take a risk, a new opportunity, a new thing, something that no one has thinked about it."" This sentence could be rephrased to better connect to the rest of the essay.

Lastly, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, which affects the overall impact of their argument. While the writer uses some relevant vocabulary, such as ""exploit"" and ""opportunities,"" they could benefit from using more nuanced and sophisticated language to convey their ideas.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they are in reality. The essay is well-structured, with two main points supporting the argument: the discrepancy between the advertised product and the actual product, and the potential for wasted money due to misleading advertisements.

Strengths:

1. The student provides specific examples from personal experiences to support their argument, such as the friend's disappointing mp-3 purchase and their own experience with the movie ""National Treasure.""
2. The essay is easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
3. The student attempts to address a potential counterargument, stating that not all advertisements are misleading, but most are.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. Many sentences are simple and repetitive, which makes the writing seem basic.
2. The student could have provided more evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions.
3. The conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Vary sentence structures and vocabulary to create more engaging and sophisticated writing.
2. Provide more evidence to support the claims, such as statistics or expert opinions.
3. Revise the conclusion to make it more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, agreeing with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides two specific examples to support their argument, which is a good attempt to engage with the prompt. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Firstly, the writer's language and grammar need significant improvement. There are numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure, which make the text difficult to understand at times. For instance, ""Being a young person is a difficult thing nowadays"" could be rephrased to ""Being a young person is a challenging experience nowadays."" Similarly, ""young pepole"" should be spelled as ""young people."" These errors detract from the writer's message and make the essay seem less polished.

Secondly, the writer's examples, although specific, lack depth and analysis. The first example about the apartment being cleaned is a good start, but it could be developed further by explaining why young people ignore the older people's requests. The second example about the broken television is also a good attempt, but it could be more effective if the writer had provided more context about the consequences of the young man's actions.

Thirdly, the writer's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The sentence ""Thus, I belive that young people do not give enoug time to helping their communities"" is a good summary of the writer's stance, but it could be more effective if it was followed by a more detailed analysis of the reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, disagreeing with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities. The essay provides some specific reasons and examples to support the answer, including community service requirements in schools, the opportunity to gain honors, and the personal benefit of relaxation. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples, such as community service requirements in schools and the opportunity to gain honors. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to support the student's argument. Additionally, the student has attempted to address potential counterarguments, such as students who may not be willing to do community service, and has provided a counterpoint to this argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing community service requirements to the personal benefit of relaxation, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""Sometimes doing community service is a relax for us"" and ""I'm using my relaxing time to help my commuity and the people who need my help."" These sentences could be rephrased for clarity and grammatical correctness.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their argument. While the essay mentions community service requirements in schools, it would be more effective to provide specific examples of how these requirements benefit the community. Additionally, the student could explore the potential drawbacks of community service requirements, such as the potential for tokenism or superficial involvement.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points made in the essay and re-emphasized the student's argument. As it stands, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and does not leave the reader with a lasting impression.

Evaluation:

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer attempts to provide a balanced view by discussing both sides of the argument, but the organization and coherence of the essay could be improved. 

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's effort to provide specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention that young people have more friends, can play, talk, and study with them, and have more energy to enjoy their life. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to illustrate the writer's point.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer's language and grammar are not always accurate, which can make it difficult to understand their intended meaning. For example, ""As we know,young people in school have a lot of time.they can play with them.talk with them,and study with them"" should be rewritten as ""As we know, young people in school have a lot of time. They can play with them, talk with them, and study with them."" The use of commas and correct verb tense is essential for clear communication.

Additionally, the writer's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, the sentence ""On the other hands, older people also enjoy their life"" seems abrupt and could be connected to the previous paragraph with a more logical transition.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is somewhat unclear. The sentence ""Sweeping generationlize to this is impossiveble here.I n a world.I think both young and old are enjroy their life better and better"" is difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. They provide some valid reasons and examples to support their argument, including the influence of a new way of life, the emphasis on personal goals, and the lack of awareness about community problems.

Strengths:

1. The student has attempted to address the prompt by providing a clear thesis statement and supporting it with some relevant points.
2. They have used transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, making the essay somewhat coherent.
3. The student has attempted to use vocabulary related to the topic, such as ""selfishness,"" ""awareness,"" and ""realize.""

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas and sentences presented in a somewhat disorganized manner.
2. The student's writing is often unclear, with sentences that are wordy, awkwardly phrased, or contain grammatical errors (e.g., ""Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation's goals focused on community"").
3. The student relies heavily on vague statements and generalizations, such as ""our new style of life"" and ""our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position.""
4. The essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the student's claims.
5. The student's writing lacks depth and nuance, with some ideas feeling underdeveloped or oversimplified.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the prompt, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. The essay provides some relevant examples to support the argument, such as the college admission scenario and the restaurant owner example. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the main issues is the writing quality, particularly in terms of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are numerous errors throughout the essay, such as ""smatter"" instead of ""smarter,"" ""compitition"" instead of ""competition,"" ""expirement"" instead of ""experiment,"" and ""defferent"" instead of ""different."" These errors can make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning and detract from the overall coherence of the essay.

In terms of content, the student's examples are somewhat simplistic and lack depth. The college admission scenario, for instance, could be developed further to provide more insight into the student's thinking. Additionally, the restaurant owner example is not fully fleshed out, and the student could have explored the potential risks and consequences of taking a chance on an original name.

The student also attempts to use personal experience to support their argument, citing their experience as a brain cancer survivor. However, this example feels somewhat disconnected from the main argument and could be integrated more smoothly into the essay.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and provides some relevant examples to support their argument. With further development and refinement, this essay could be strengthened.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the topic, but it lacks coherence and clarity in its structure and language. The writer attempts to provide reasons and examples to support their argument, but the explanations are often vague and lack specific details. The essay also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, which hinder the overall understanding of the writer's message.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify two potential benefits of taking risks, which are getting a better job and having a good situation in society. However, the explanations for these points are not well-developed and lack concrete examples. For instance, the writer mentions that a successful person may want to be a chef, but they do not provide any specific reasons why this would be a desirable career choice or how it relates to taking risks.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar, which makes it difficult to follow their argument. For example, the sentence ""To begin with one of the most important reasons of trying new things and taking risks is that people get a better job"" is a run-on sentence that lacks clarity. Additionally, the writer uses phrases such as ""it is obvious that"" and ""for instance,"" which are not necessary and make the writing seem less formal.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simple phrases and sentences. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""everybody around him respects him"" to explain the benefit of having a good situation in society, but this phrase is not specific or convincing.

To improve, the writer should focus on developing their ideas and providing more specific examples to support their argument. They should also work on improving their grammar and sentence structure to make their writing more clear and concise.
