The essay presents a unique and relatable narrative about the author's experience as an exchange student in a new school. The author effectively utilizes vivid imagery and sensory details to convey their feelings of isolation and loneliness, making the reader empathize with their situation. The use of onomatopoeic words such as ""Snap,"" ""EEEK,"" ""SLAM,"" and ""Pat, flick, sproing"" effectively captures the author's emotions and creates a dynamic atmosphere.

The author's description of their classmates, particularly @CAPS3, is well-written and showcases their distinct personality. The author's inner monologue, which reveals their insecurities and self-doubt, adds depth to the narrative and makes the reader understand their perspective. The author's use of metaphors, such as comparing themselves to a ""flock of seagulls haircut,"" is creative and adds to the narrative's emotional impact.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the narrative jumps between different scenes and emotions. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall flow of the essay.

The author's use of language is often simplistic, which is understandable given the middle school level. However, some sentences, such as ""I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.

Despite these limitations, the essay effectively conveys the author's emotional journey and the transformative power of laughter. The author's writing style is engaging, and their use of humor and wit adds a lighthearted touch to the narrative.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey Saeng's determination and resilience. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and hope that are present throughout the narrative. The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image of the changing seasons and the cyclical nature of life. This imagery serves to emphasize Saeng's resolve to take the test again, suggesting that she is willing to wait for the right moment to try again.

The author's decision to set the test-taking moment in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding, is also significant. This choice implies that Saeng is willing to wait for a time of renewal and growth, rather than trying to force her way through the test when she is not prepared. This demonstrates her understanding of the importance of timing and patience in achieving her goals.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""vowed"" to describe Saeng's promise to herself suggests a sense of commitment and determination. The fact that she is making this promise silently, to herself, implies that she is deeply personal and introspective, and that she is willing to take responsibility for her own success.

Overall, the conclusion of the story effectively conveys Saeng's determination and resilience, and serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance and patience in achieving one's goals.

The essay provides a clear and relatable account of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist's emotions and experiences throughout his journey. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the natural scenery, such as ""cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite"" and ""the hotter, and less water supply he had left."" These descriptions not only help the reader visualize the setting but also convey the cyclist's emotional state at different points in the story.

However, the writer could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the initial enthusiasm and determination of the cyclist to his growing desperation and worry. Adding transitional phrases or sentences could improve the flow of the essay and make it easier to follow.

Additionally, the writer could provide more analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist's character development. For example, the writer notes that the cyclist's emotions change from ""begin lugubvious"" to ""thankful"" upon arriving at GARY AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP, but does not fully explain how the setting contributes to this transformation. Exploring this connection in more depth could add depth to the essay.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of how to describe the setting and its impact on the protagonist. With some revisions to address the issues mentioned above, the essay has the potential to be even stronger.

The student's attempt to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir is a good start, but it lacks specificity and clarity. The student's statement ""The mood created by the author in the memoir is talking about this boy's life and about his parents and what they do for a living and what they are and how they are nice to other people...."" is too broad and doesn't provide any concrete evidence from the memoir to support the claim. The student's conclusion that ""Its all about careing, and love, happiness"" is also too vague and doesn't demonstrate a thorough understanding of the author's tone.

To improve, the student should have provided specific examples from the memoir to illustrate the author's mood. For instance, they could have mentioned a particular scene or quote that conveys the author's kindness and love for others. Additionally, the student could have analyzed the author's use of language, imagery, or tone to support their claim.

To take it a step further, the student could have explored the author's use of descriptive language to create a specific atmosphere or mood. For example, they could have noted how the author's descriptions of the boy's parents' actions or interactions with others contribute to the overall mood of the memoir.

Overall, while the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt, they need to provide more specific and detailed analysis to support their claim.

The essay provides a personal anecdote about a time when the student experienced patience while waiting in line for a roller coaster at Cedar Point. The student's excitement and eagerness to ride the roller coaster are palpable, and their description of the experience is engaging. However, the essay lacks cohesion and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a meandering narrative.

The student's writing demonstrates a clear enthusiasm for the topic of patience, but their writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""we was"" and ""I got really tired, but I kept mouing forward,"" detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to help the reader visualize the experience.

The student's conclusion, which highlights the moment when they rode the roller coaster, is a strong point in the essay. However, the transition to this conclusion feels abrupt, and the student could have provided more context to explain why this moment was significant in illustrating patience.

To improve, the student should focus on developing a more cohesive narrative structure, using more descriptive language, and refining their writing style to convey a more polished tone.

The student's essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers. The writer effectively uses various examples to support their claim, such as the ability to access information, communicate with others, and engage in entertainment. However, the essay lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and informal language (e.g., ""you can never spend enuf time on the computer"").

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""you can never spend enuf time on the computer"") and hyperbole (""endless amount of programs""), adds to the persuasive tone, but also detracts from the overall coherence of the essay. Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments, such as the negative effects of excessive computer use on physical and mental health.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clear thesis statement, organizing their ideas more effectively, and using more precise language.

The student demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and organization. The writer seems to have struggled with grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. The use of abbreviations and informal language (e.g., ""geting"" instead of ""getting"") detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The student provides some relevant information about the obstacles the builders faced, such as the difficulty of navigating the dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building due to wind resistance. However, the writer fails to provide specific details and supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate their claims. For instance, the excerpt does not mention the wind as a significant obstacle, and the mention of a fire from another dirigible is not supported by any evidence.

The student also raises some valid concerns about the safety of having a dirigible docked at the Empire State Building, citing the flammability of the gases inside. However, this point is not fully developed, and the writer does not provide any concrete evidence to support their argument.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed information from the excerpt, organizing their ideas more clearly, and using proper grammar and spelling. Additionally, they should strive to use more formal language and avoid abbreviations.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student identifies the dominant emotion of gratitude and supports it with specific quotes from the text. However, the analysis could benefit from more depth and nuance. The student's understanding of the quotes is good, but the connections between the quotes and the overall mood are not fully explored.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the author's tone and emotions, but the writing could be more sophisticated. The sentence structure is simple, and the vocabulary is limited. The use of grammatical errors, such as ""definatley"" and ""obiously,"" detract from the overall quality of the essay.

To take the analysis to the next level, the student could have explored the ways in which the author's mood is conveyed through descriptive language, imagery, and symbolism. They could have also analyzed the ways in which the author's emotions are developed throughout the memoir, rather than simply identifying a single dominant emotion.

Additionally, the student could have used more precise and technical vocabulary to describe the author's tone and mood. For example, instead of saying ""strong and apperent mood,"" they could have said ""the author's tone is characterized by a sense of gratitude and appreciation.""

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the entire argument together. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the difficulties of building a suitable landing area to the safety concerns of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and then to the challenges posed by nature. A more cohesive structure would have strengthened the essay.

The student provides some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the fact that dirigibles held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame (paragraph @NUM1) and the dangers of hydrogen-filled dirigibles (paragraph @NUM2). However, the student fails to provide specific examples or supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate these claims. For instance, the student mentions the Hindenburg incident in New Jersey, but it is not clear how this relates to the Empire State Building's dirigible docking issue.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""annanced"" instead of ""announced"" and ""swivle"" instead of ""swivel."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. With further refinement and attention to detail, the essay could have been more effective in conveying the obstacles to dirigible docking.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about patience, albeit with some grammatical and stylistic issues. The writer attempts to convey the idea that patience is about tolerating difficulties without complaining, which is a valuable lesson. However, the narrative is marred by informal language, excessive use of abbreviations, and a lack of cohesion.

The writer's use of first-person narration and colloquial expressions (""I moaned,"" ""on!"", ""I guess I"") creates a conversational tone, which may not be suitable for a formal essay. Additionally, the text is peppered with abbreviations and slang terms (e.g., ""@CAPS18,"" ""@CAPS1""), which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing.

The story itself is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between scenes and a lack of clear structure. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the traffic jam to the reception, without much explanation or connection between the two events. This disjointedness makes it challenging to follow the narrative and understand the writer's intended message.

Despite these issues, the writer does convey a clear message about patience and acknowledges their own limitations. The final sentence, ""I was proud,"" suggests a sense of growth and self-awareness, which is a positive aspect of the essay.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their writing style, using more formal language, and developing a clearer narrative structure. They should also proofread their work more thoroughly to eliminate grammatical errors and abbreviations.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various obstacles together. The student has provided some relevant information, such as the weight of the dirigible, wind pressure, and the use of hydrogen, but the connections between these points are not explicitly stated.

The student has also failed to provide specific examples or evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that the architects strengthened the building's frame to withstand the added stress, but do not provide details about the extent of this modification or its effectiveness. Furthermore, the student's discussion of the risks associated with hydrogen and the law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low around urban areas feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""the biggest problem"" and ""enormous obstacle"" are overly simplistic and do not add much depth to the discussion.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, echoing the sentiments of Katherine Paterson's quote. The writer argues that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch, and that censorship is not the solution to addressing offense. The writer's personal anecdotes, such as the experience at the bait shop, effectively illustrate their point and add a touch of authenticity to the essay.

However, the essay lacks a clear and structured argument. The writer's ideas are not well-organized, and the transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. The writing style is informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay. Additionally, the writer relies heavily on phrases such as ""get over it"" and ""heys,"" which detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to support their claim. While they mention Katherine Paterson's quote, they do not engage with the author's ideas or provide a nuanced analysis of the issue. The writer's assertion that ""in life there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you"" is a vague statement that does not contribute to a compelling argument.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, resilience, and the cyclical nature of life, which are woven throughout the narrative. The mention of spring, snows melting, and geese returning serves as a powerful metaphor for the renewal of life, emphasizing the idea that even in the midst of adversity, there is always the possibility for growth and new beginnings.

The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to herself in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding, is particularly significant. The hibiscus, as a flower, is often associated with beauty, hope, and new life, which aligns perfectly with the themes of the story. By linking the hibiscus to the test-taking experience, the author creates a sense of connection between the protagonist's personal struggle and the natural world, underscoring the idea that even in the face of challenges, there is always the potential for growth and improvement.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""silently"" to describe Saeng's vow suggests a sense of determination and resolve, implying that she is committed to overcoming her fears and taking the test again. This conclusion also leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism, as Saeng's vow implies that she will emerge stronger and more confident in the future.

While the writer mentions that they were patient, they do not provide a clear explanation of what this means or how it helped them cope with the situation. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more nuanced language and varied sentence structures to enhance the overall writing quality.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt by identifying two obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, the student's analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student fails to provide specific details and evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, the student mentions that the builders had to add a top or a hat to the building to make it taller, but there is no mention of this in the provided excerpt. Furthermore, the student's statement that flying too low is a huge safety hazard is a general statement that could be applied to any situation, rather than a specific challenge faced by the Empire State Building.

Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of the phrase ""Anothe obstacle"" instead of ""Another obstacle."" The student also fails to provide proper citation for the source of the information, as indicated by the ""@"" symbol.

The essay touches on the idea that the features of the setting can impact the cyclist, but it lacks depth and concrete examples to support this claim. The statement ""the knowledge of the cyclist is limited"" is vague and does not provide a clear connection to the setting. The phrase ""old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office"" is an interesting observation, but it does not directly address how the setting affects the cyclist. The essay seems to be more focused on the idea that older people should relax and watch younger people, which is not directly related to the prompt.

To strengthen the essay, the writer could provide more specific examples of how the setting influences the cyclist, such as how the terrain, weather, or infrastructure affects their experience. For instance, they could describe how a hilly terrain might make it more challenging for a cyclist to ride, or how inclement weather might make it more difficult to navigate.

The use of descriptive language, such as ""nearly broke mine with how distressed he was"" and ""we laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried,"" effectively conveys the intensity of the emotions involved.

The writer also explores the theme of laughter as a coping mechanism, highlighting its ability to release stress and anxiety. The anecdote about the writer's brother's conversation with his friend and the subsequent laughter is a great example of this. The writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time?"" adds depth to the essay and encourages the reader to think critically about the role of laughter in overcoming challenges.

Furthermore, the essay struggles with coherence and organization. The author jumps abruptly from discussing their personal experience to mentioning unrelated details, such as hunting and a buck. This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to follow the author's train of thought and understand the main point of the essay.

The tone of the essay is also inconsistent. The author starts off with a humorous tone, but quickly shifts to a more serious and reflective tone as they discuss their experience with patience. While this shift is understandable, it feels abrupt and disrupts the flow of the essay.

Despite these issues, the author does demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of patience and its importance. They also show a willingness to reflect on their own experiences and acknowledge areas for improvement.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the essay lacks clarity and coherence. The student has identified three obstacles: safety, nature, and law, but fails to provide specific and relevant information to support their claims. The student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""hinderred be"" instead of ""hindered by,"" and the lack of proper sentence structure.

The student's use of transitional phrases, such as ""obstacles such as safety, nature, and law,"" is also a red flag, as it indicates a lack of understanding of how to effectively connect ideas between sentences. Furthermore, the student's writing is overly simplistic, with phrases such as ""futile attempt"" and ""violent air currents"" that do not add depth or nuance to the discussion.

One notable aspect of the essay is the student's use of specific details from the excerpt, such as the mention of ""highly flammable hydrogen"" and ""existing legislation."" However, these details are not effectively integrated into the essay, and the student fails to explain their significance.

Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, grammar, and analysis. The student would benefit from revising their essay to provide more specific and relevant information, as well as improving their writing style and sentence structure.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by describing the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the entire essay together. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made"" which should be ""Over $1 million worth of changes had to be made"" and ""accomadate"" should be ""accommodate."" Furthermore, the student's writing is often unclear and lacks specific details. For instance, the student mentions that the builders designed a mast that would be ""rocket-shaped, made with aluminum,"" but fails to explain the significance of this design choice.

The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how the lack of floors for a boarding area affected the construction of the Empire State Building. The sentence ""They had begun to build additinoal floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area"" is unclear and lacks context. The student's writing also lacks transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow their argument.

Despite these issues, the student has demonstrated some understanding of the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. The student correctly identifies the need for significant changes to the building's framework to accommodate the dirigibles.

The student's essay raises several concerns regarding censorship in libraries, but it lacks depth and coherence in its arguments. The student's primary focus is on the potential negative consequences of exposure to certain materials, but they fail to provide concrete evidence or examples to support their claims. The essay's structure is also simplistic, with each point being presented as a separate, disconnected idea.

One of the main issues with the essay is its lack of nuance. The student presents a binary view of censorship, implying that any material that is deemed ""bad"" should be removed from the shelves. However, this approach neglects the importance of critical thinking and media literacy in helping students navigate complex issues. By removing all potentially ""offensive"" materials, students may miss out on valuable learning opportunities and the chance to engage with diverse perspectives.

Furthermore, the student's arguments are often based on unsubstantiated claims and generalizations. For instance, they state that certain materials ""teach kids bad things"" without providing any evidence to support this claim. This type of blanket statement oversimplifies the complex issues surrounding censorship and fails to acknowledge the importance of context and critical thinking.

Additionally, the student's writing style is often unclear and lacks coherence. Sentences are short and simplistic, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. The use of repetitive phrases, such as ""there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it,"" detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, while the student raises some valid concerns about censorship, their essay falls short in terms of depth, coherence, and critical thinking. To improve, the student should focus on providing more nuanced arguments, using evidence to support their claims, and developing a more sophisticated writing style.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from the author's personal experience and observations. The author effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and allusion to emphasize their point. The use of phrases like ""I myself have experienced"" and ""I believe"" creates a sense of authenticity and personal connection to the topic.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The author's reasoning is often based on simplistic binary oppositions (e.g., ""people should have their own choice"" vs. ""materials should be removed""), which may not fully capture the complexity of the issue. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more concrete examples and evidence to support the author's claims.

Furthermore, the writing could be more polished, with some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing detracting from the overall impact of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around"" could be rephrased for clarity and coherence.

Despite these limitations, the essay demonstrates a clear and passionate voice, and the author's commitment to their position is admirable. With further refinement and attention to detail, this essay has the potential to be a compelling and persuasive argument.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging narrative about the author's experience with patience, showcasing their ability to reflect on their emotions and behaviors in a specific situation. The use of first-person narration allows the reader to connect with the author's feelings and thoughts, making the essay more accessible and enjoyable to read.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance humor and vulnerability. The author's use of witty remarks, such as ""I was both patient and impatient at parts,"" adds a lighthearted tone to the essay, making it more engaging and entertaining. However, there are moments where the humor feels forced, and the author could benefit from refining their writing to ensure that the tone is consistent throughout.

The essay also demonstrates the author's ability to analyze their own emotions and behaviors, which is a crucial aspect of developing emotional intelligence. The author's reflection on their patience and impatience is thoughtful and insightful, providing a clear understanding of their emotional state during the situation.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive structure and organization. The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing the author's anticipation of the trip to describing the actual experience, and the transitions between paragraphs feel somewhat disjointed. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary information, which can make the essay feel cluttered and difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the author could benefit from more precise language and varied sentence structures. The use of simple sentences, such as ""I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned,"" can make the essay feel flat and unengaging. Varying sentence structure and using more descriptive language can help to create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience.

In terms of content, the essay effectively explores the concept of patience and how it can manifest in different situations. The author's experience with babysitting and waiting for a trip provides a relatable context for discussing patience, and their reflection on their emotions and behaviors is thoughtful and insightful.

Overall, the essay demonstrates potential, but could benefit from refinement in terms of structure, organization, and language. With further development, the author has the potential to create a compelling and engaging narrative that effectively explores the concept of patience.

The student's analysis of the concluding paragraph of the story is a good attempt to understand the author's intentions. However, the student's interpretation of the paragraph's meaning is somewhat limited. The student focuses primarily on the physical changes in nature, such as the melting snow and blooming hibiscus, and assumes that these changes symbolize Saeng's acceptance of the change. While these elements do contribute to the overall atmosphere of the story, they do not necessarily convey Saeng's emotional state.

A more nuanced analysis would consider the context of the story and the character's emotional journey. The student mentions that Saeng is ""upset and not really liking the change,"" but this sentiment is not explicitly stated in the concluding paragraph. Instead, the paragraph presents a sense of resolve and determination, as Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring. This suggests that Saeng is not yet fully accepting the change, but is instead finding ways to cope with it.

Furthermore, the student's interpretation of the paragraph as ""optimistic"" is somewhat simplistic. While the image of the blooming hibiscus and returning geese may be positive, it is also a reminder of the past and the life Saeng left behind. The author may be suggesting that Saeng is finding ways to hold onto the past while also moving forward, rather than simply accepting the change.

In conclusion, while the student's analysis is a good starting point, a more detailed and contextual understanding of the story is necessary to fully appreciate the author's intentions.

One area for improvement is the organization and structure of the essay.

The author effectively conveys a sense of happiness and warmth in the memoir, primarily through the descriptions of his parents and Cuban culture. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."" This sentence showcases the author's appreciation for his parents' efforts in making their home a warm and welcoming space. The use of the word ""traditional"" highlights the significance of Cuban culture in the author's life, which is a recurring theme throughout the memoir. However, the analysis could be more nuanced, as the author could delve deeper into the specific aspects of Cuban culture that contribute to the overall mood of happiness.

Additionally, the author could benefit from providing more specific examples and details to support his claims. For instance, what specific traditions or customs did his parents incorporate into their home that made it feel like a ""traditional Cuban home""? How did these traditions impact the author's daily life and emotions? By providing more concrete examples, the author could strengthen his argument and create a more compelling narrative.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to effectively bring together the various themes and ideas presented throughout the narrative. The inclusion of the hibiscus, a flower that has been a symbol of hope and renewal, serves as a poignant reminder of Saeng's emotional journey. The author skillfully weaves together the significance of the flower, the girl's feelings of happiness and sadness, and her determination to move forward, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation.

The author's decision to have Saeng vow to take the test again, despite the uncertainty of the future, showcases her growth and resilience. This conclusion also leaves room for interpretation, allowing the reader to ponder the outcome of the story and the possibilities that lie ahead. The use of the phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" creates a sense of time passing and the cyclical nature of life, emphasizing the idea that Saeng is ready to face new challenges and experiences.

Furthermore, the author's choice of language and imagery in this final paragraph is noteworthy. The use of sensory details, such as the melting snow and the blooming hibiscus, effectively transports the reader to the setting and immerses them in Saeng's world. The phrase ""I will take that test again"" is also a powerful statement, conveying Saeng's determination and willingness to learn and grow.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, using phrases such as ""A person who is patient is some one who can wait and they don't while every two second"" and ""A person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal."" However, some of the language and sentence structures are simplistic and could be improved.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. The use of all caps and excessive punctuation marks detracts from the overall coherence and readability of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of patience to sharing a personal anecdote, and then again to discussing the benefits of patience. A more cohesive structure would help to flow the essay more smoothly.

Overall, the student shows promise in their writing, but could benefit from further refinement and attention to detail.

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's choices and that removing certain materials from shelves would infringe upon their freedom of expression. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their stance, stating that many kids are influenced by their peers and that parents should take responsibility for their children's actions. However, the writer's argument is weakened by the lack of concrete evidence and logical reasoning. The writer fails to address the potential harm that certain materials can cause to children, such as exposure to explicit content that can lead to negative behaviors or attitudes.

Furthermore, the writer's assertion that not all music or movies are offensive and that parents should not be blamed for their children's choices is not convincing. The writer's statement that ""Not all music or movies are offensive"" is a vague claim that does not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support it. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that parents should simply ""change the way they raise their children"" is a simplistic solution that does not address the root issue of censorship.

The writer's writing style is also marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""i"" instead of ""I"" and the lack of proper punctuation. The writer's tone is also inconsistent, veering wildly from a persuasive argument to a defensive statement. Overall, while the writer raises some valid points, their argument is not convincing and could benefit from more evidence, logical reasoning, and attention to grammar and punctuation.

The essay provides a relatable and entertaining account of a camping trip with a friend's family, highlighting the importance of laughter in bringing people together. The writer effectively uses vivid descriptions of the setting and interactions with the family members to create a humorous tone. The inclusion of specific details, such as the time of day, the names of the locations, and the characters' personalities, adds to the authenticity of the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance humor with heartwarming moments. The writer skillfully weaves together the comedic moments, such as the secret agent story, with the more emotional moments, like the anxiety of the mother-to-be. This balance creates a engaging narrative that keeps the reader invested in the story.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, which sometimes feel disconnected. Additionally, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. The writer could also benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the overall flow and clarity of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on first-person pronouns, which can make the essay feel somewhat egocentric. While it's understandable that the writer is sharing their personal experience, it's essential to strike a balance between self-expression and objectivity.

Lastly, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong sense of humor and creativity, but could benefit from refinement in terms of organization, clarity, and technical writing skills.

The image of the hibiscus, a flower that blooms in the spring, serves as a powerful symbol of hope and renewal, underscoring the idea that even in the midst of adversity, there is always the possibility for growth and improvement.

The author's decision to set the conclusion in the spring, a season often associated with new beginnings, adds to the sense of optimism and promise. The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of commitment and resolve, highlighting Saeng's determination to overcome her struggles. Furthermore, the phrase ""I will take that test again"" serves as a clear call to action, encouraging the reader to reflect on the importance of persistence and hard work in achieving success.

The author's conclusion is also notable for its subtlety and restraint.

The writer presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, effectively addressing the complexities of individual perspectives and the importance of free access to information. The essay begins by highlighting the subjective nature of what is considered offensive, emphasizing that people choose to believe and interpret information in different ways. This is a crucial point, as it underscores the need for personal autonomy and the freedom to make one's own decisions about what to read or watch.

The writer also effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument. The mention of teenagers' interests in action and romantic films, as well as the potential impact of censorship on their reading habits, is a relatable and persuasive point. The writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another,"" adds to the persuasive power of the essay.

However, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their argument. For instance, they could have explored the concept of context and how it influences one's perception of what is considered offensive. Additionally, the writer could have delved deeper into the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of marginalized voices and the limitation of access to information.

Furthermore, the writer's tone sometimes veers between persuasive and confrontational, with phrases such as ""What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next."" While the writer's intention is to emphasize the subjective nature of offense, this tone can come across as dismissive of others' perspectives.

This conclusion highlights the idea that the protagonist, Saeng, is willing to try again, much like the natural world, which is characterized by renewal and rebirth.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting of snow and the return of geese, effectively evokes a sense of hope and new beginnings. The image of the hibiscus blooming also symbolizes growth and beauty, which contrasts with the initial disappointment and frustration expressed by Saeng. By linking these natural events to her personal growth, the author creates a sense of continuity and connection between the natural world and the protagonist's emotional journey.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""vowed"" suggests a sense of determination and commitment, implying that Saeng is willing to take a second chance at growing a garden. This conclusion also leaves room for interpretation, allowing the reader to wonder what will happen next and whether Saeng will ultimately succeed in her endeavor.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis and supporting evidence from the text. The writer's statement that ""I feel as if she wasn’t happy enough"" to grow another garden is a subjective interpretation that could be supported with more textual evidence.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, citing specific examples from the text. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to convey the challenges faced by the cyclist, such as the heat, large hills, and lack of cold water. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions and a clearer structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the heat to the hills and then to the terrain, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas.

The writer also relies heavily on the use of phrases such as ""the first couple"" and ""the sign jumped out,"" which can be seen as informal and detract from the overall tone of the essay. Furthermore, the writer could provide more analysis and explanation of how these features specifically affect the cyclist, rather than simply stating the facts.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides relevant examples to support their argument. With some refinement in terms of structure, transitions, and analysis, this essay has the potential to be even stronger.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt by identifying two obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. However, the student could have provided more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support their answer. The student relies heavily on the author's statements from the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by {PERSON}, which may not be entirely accurate or reliable. The student could have also provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply stating them as facts.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions and connections between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing safety concerns to discussing the impact of nature, without clear linking between the two ideas. The student could have also used more precise vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the student could have addressed the issue of the dirigibles' fuel composition, which is mentioned in the excerpt as a significant concern. The student's statement that ""Hydrogen is highly flammable"" is a good start, but it could be supported with more specific information about the risks associated with hydrogen and how it relates to the docking process.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good foundation for understanding the obstacles faced by the builders, but could benefit from more detailed analysis, precise vocabulary, and cohesive writing.

The essay presents a well-structured argument on the topic of censorship in libraries, with the writer expressing their personal opinion on the matter. The writer effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (""no source of knowledge should be taken off any shelf"") and metaphors (""some of the best books on our shelves are the ones that are offensive"") to convey their point. However, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (""In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable"").

The writer's argument is also marred by a lack of concrete evidence and logical reasoning. While they mention specific examples of books that they believe should not be removed from the shelves, they fail to provide a clear explanation of why these books are important or why they should be preserved. Furthermore, their assertion that ""if everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when I'm older"" is unclear and unsupported by evidence.

Additionally, the writer's tone is often confrontational and dismissive, with phrases such as ""if you find a book offensive don't read it!"" coming across as overly simplistic and unhelpful. The writer also fails to acknowledge potential counterarguments to their position, such as the potential harm that certain books could cause to vulnerable readers.

Overall, while the writer demonstrates some enthusiasm and passion for the topic, their argument is ultimately undermined by a lack of clarity, evidence, and logical reasoning.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise stance on the issue of censorship in libraries. However, the writing lacks depth and organization, which hinders the overall effectiveness of the argument. The student's use of transitional phrases and cohesive sentences is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the lack of supporting evidence. The student relies heavily on personal opinions and assumptions, rather than providing concrete examples or research to back up their claims. For instance, the statement ""if a young child or teenager can't see, read or hear those types of things then they should not be in there period"" is vague and lacks specific details. What types of content are being referred to, and how would the student propose to ensure that children are protected from such materials?

Furthermore, the student's suggestion of segregating offensive materials into a separate section or requiring patrons to request them from the front desk raises concerns about accessibility and inclusivity. How would this system ensure that all patrons, regardless of age or ability, can access the materials they need? Would this system be fair and equitable for all users?

The student's writing also lacks nuance and critical thinking. They fail to consider multiple perspectives on the issue, instead relying on a simplistic ""if it's offensive, it should be removed"" approach. This type of thinking neglects the importance of intellectual freedom and the value of exposing students to diverse perspectives and ideas.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a more nuanced and evidence-based argument. They should consider multiple perspectives, provide concrete examples, and think critically about the potential consequences of their proposed solutions.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph, providing a clear indication of Saeng's intentions and motivations. The text reveals that Saeng's life is deeply connected to planting, as evident from the fact that she and her mother spend most of their time in the garden, growing crops to sell and save for winter. The author skillfully weaves in specific details, such as the geese flying over Saeng's head and landing in the yard, to emphasize her love for nature and her desire to return to the garden when the snow melts. The phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" serves as a poignant reminder of the cyclical nature of the seasons and Saeng's connection to the natural world.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the image of Saeng getting her hands and knees dirty in the soil, effectively conveys her enthusiasm and dedication to planting. The text also highlights Saeng's resilience and determination, as she vows to take the test again, suggesting that she is willing to persevere despite any challenges she may face.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and supporting evidence from the text. The writer's statements, such as ""Saeng life revolves around @CAPS1"" and ""Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting,"" feel somewhat generic and lack concrete textual support. Additionally, the writer's interpretation of the paragraph's meaning, such as the idea that Saeng wants to start planting again ""more than anything,"" could be more explicitly tied to the text.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion effectively counters the bleak tone established in the previous paragraphs, where the family's struggles and hardships are described. The mention of spring, geese, and the budding hibiscus creates a vivid image of a time of rebirth and new beginnings. This imagery serves as a powerful symbol of the cyclical nature of life, suggesting that even in the darkest times, there is always the possibility for renewal and improvement.

The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to herself to retake the test when spring arrives implies that she is determined to overcome her struggles and achieve her goals. This determination is reinforced by the fact that Saeng is not alone in her hopes for a better future; the story implies that the entire family is looking forward to the arrival of spring, which suggests a sense of collective optimism. The use of the word ""vowed"" also implies a sense of commitment and resolve, underscoring Saeng's determination to succeed.

Furthermore, the author's conclusion effectively leaves the reader with a sense of hope and possibility, rather than despair or resignation. This is particularly significant for middle school students, who may be struggling with their own academic and personal challenges. The author's message of resilience and determination is likely to inspire and motivate young readers to persevere in the face of adversity.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by describing the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The student seems to focus on two specific obstacles: the lack of a suitable landing area and the modifications made to the building's plans. The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how these obstacles hindered the use of dirigibles.

Furthermore, the essay lacks concrete evidence from the excerpt to support the claims made. The student only quotes one sentence from the excerpt, which is not sufficient to establish a clear argument. The student also fails to provide a clear analysis of the significance of the mooring mast and its impact on the dirigibles. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses.

Additionally, the student's organization and transitions between paragraphs are not well-developed, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. The student could have provided more context about the historical significance of the Empire State Building and the dirigibles, which would have added depth to the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by describing the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The student has provided some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the lack of suitable landing area and the use of hydrogen instead of helium, which is a crucial safety concern. Nevertheless, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed explanations of these points. The student has also failed to provide a clear connection between the obstacles and the overall impact on the construction of the Empire State Building.

Furthermore, the student has made some errors in their paraphrasing of the excerpt. For instance, in paragraph six, it is stated that the dock would only allow dirigibles to anchor for several hours, but in paragraph thirteen, it is mentioned that an accident could have been worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The student should have been more precise in their paraphrasing to avoid confusion.

Additionally, the student could have explored the significance of the dirigible docking issue in the context of the Empire State Building's construction.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the setting affects the cyclist in the story. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with some sentences feeling disconnected from each other. For instance, the transition between the first and second sentences is abrupt, and the phrase ""All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster"" feels like an afterthought. Additionally, the word ""alot"" is a colloquialism that should be replaced with the correct spelling ""a lot"" to improve the writing's formal tone.

Moreover, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting. The phrase ""the sun is heating down on him"" is a good start, but it would be more effective to describe the sun's intensity, such as ""the blistering sun beats down relentlessly"" or ""the scorching sun radiates heat."" Similarly, the phrase ""very rough terrain"" is vague and could be replaced with a more specific description, such as ""the rocky, sandy, and steep terrain"" to give the reader a better sense of the cyclist's environment.

Finally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist's emotions. The phrase ""making him feel very disprate"" is a bit unclear, and it would be more effective to explain what specifically about the setting is causing the cyclist to feel this way. For example, the writer could describe how the harsh environment is exacerbating the cyclist's physical discomfort or how the isolation of the desert landscape is affecting his mental state.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The student seems to jump between different obstacles without providing a cohesive argument. For instance, the mention of the Hindenburg's fire in New Jersey is an interesting anecdote, but it does not directly relate to the Empire State Building's docking issue. Furthermore, the student uses vague phrases such as ""the largest obstacle they faced"" without specifying what that obstacle is. The student could have provided more concrete evidence from the excerpt to support their claims.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more precise vocabulary and sentence structure. For example, instead of using the phrase ""the largest obstacle they faced,"" the student could have said ""the most significant challenge they encountered."" The student also uses colloquial expressions like ""teathered"" instead of ""tethered,"" which detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student has demonstrated an understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. They have identified the lack of safety, air currents, and pre-existing laws as significant challenges. The student has also provided some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the description of the Hindenburg's fire and the difficulties of docking the airship.

The essay presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, highlighting the importance of individual freedom of expression and the value of diverse perspectives. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples from literature, music, and film to support their stance, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple aspects of censorship, including books, music, and movies. The writer provides thoughtful examples of how each medium can be used to express complex emotions and ideas, and how censorship can stifle creativity and individuality. The use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""veiw"", ""veiwer"", ""veiws"") and allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, adds to the essay's persuasive power.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis. At times, the writer's arguments feel somewhat simplistic, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to follow.

The student's essay raises a valid concern about the role of censorship in libraries, acknowledging the importance of considering diverse perspectives and the potential impact of certain materials on readers. However, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported thesis statement, which hinders the overall coherence and persuasiveness of the argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's recognition of the importance of considering the potential harm caused by certain books, such as those containing racial slurs or hurtful language. The student's concern for the well-being of others and the potential for violence is a crucial aspect of this issue. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the complexities of censorship.

The student's use of transitional phrases, such as ""Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library: yes and no,"" is a good attempt to convey their ambivalence, but it disrupts the flow of the essay and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, the writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary.

Furthermore, the student's argument relies heavily on emotional appeals, such as the potential for violence and hurt feelings, rather than logical reasoning and evidence-based arguments. While these emotions are valid concerns, they should be supported by more concrete examples and evidence to strengthen the argument.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of considering the potential harm caused by certain books to making a blanket statement about removing all books that contain hurtful language. A more logical and cohesive structure would help to build a more convincing argument.

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is that removing offensive materials would lead to a loss of freedom of expression and creativity. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their position, making their argument more relatable and engaging. For instance, they mention their own experience of watching a television show with racial slurs and choosing to ignore it, as they recognize it as a tactic to get ratings. This example illustrates the writer's ability to think critically about the context and intent behind certain content.

However, the writer's argument is not without its flaws. At times, their reasoning relies on a simplistic ""if you don't like it, don't watch it"" approach, which may not be applicable to everyone. Additionally, the writer's use of phrases such as ""some people are offended"" and ""some people are ignorant"" comes across as dismissive and judgmental. A more nuanced approach would acknowledge the diversity of perspectives and experiences, rather than relying on generalizations.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion, while well-intentioned, feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the rest of the essay. A more effective conclusion would summarize the main points and reiterate the writer's thesis in a more concise and impactful way.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the importance of libraries as a safe space for people of all ages. The author highlights the need for age limits on certain books to prevent exposure to mature themes, which is a valid concern. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. For instance, the author mentions that censorship can help prevent exposure to ""adult like issues,"" but it does not explore the potential impact on intellectual freedom and the importance of diverse perspectives.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated sentence structures and vocabulary. The writing is often simplistic and lacks variety, which can make it difficult to follow at times. The author also relies heavily on clichéd phrases, such as ""some poeple"" and ""very detailed and adult like."" Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more concrete examples and evidence to support the author's claims.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of age limits to suggesting that parents should monitor their children's activities. A more logical flow of ideas would improve the overall coherence of the essay.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more depth, nuance, and sophistication in its analysis and writing style.

The writer's primary concern is that computers are detrimental to society, citing the negative effects on physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being. While the writer raises some valid points, such as the potential for addiction and decreased physical activity, their argument is marred by several issues.

One major concern is the writer's writing style, which is informal and lacks coherence. The text is peppered with grammatical errors, misspellings, and punctuation mistakes, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, the sentence ""A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view"" is unclear and confusing. Furthermore, the writer's tone is often confrontational and accusatory, which may deter readers from considering their perspective.

Additionally, the writer's argument relies heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning. While it is true that excessive computer use can lead to negative consequences, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. They also make sweeping statements, such as ""people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends,"" without providing any data or examples to back up these assertions.

The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments. For instance, they do not consider the benefits of computers, such as their ability to facilitate communication, education, and access to information. They also do not acknowledge the potential for computers to be used in a way that promotes physical activity, such as online fitness classes or virtual reality experiences.

In conclusion, while the writer raises some valid concerns about the impact of computers on society, their argument is weakened by poor writing, emotional appeals, and a lack of logical reasoning. To strengthen their argument, the writer should focus on providing clear, concise, and evidence-based evidence to support their claims.

The essay provides a clear and relatable account of a personal experience with patience, which is a valuable life skill for middle school students to learn. The writer effectively conveys their excitement and anticipation of getting a new dog, and their ability to remain patient while waiting for it to arrive. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with multiple sentences that seem disconnected from each other. The use of informal language, such as ""happyest day of my life,"" ""I'@CAPS1,"" and ""jerouge,"" detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer also fails to provide a clear connection between their experience and the concept of patience. The essay's tone is more focused on excitement and joy rather than reflection on the concept of patience.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from proofreading and editing to improve grammar, punctuation, and spelling. The use of abbreviations and informal language makes it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning.

To improve, the writer should focus on organizing their thoughts, using proper grammar and punctuation, and providing a clearer connection between their experience and the concept of patience.

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the challenges faced by the Empire State Building's architects in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanation of the obstacles. The student provides some relevant information, such as the need to fix the frame of the building to transmit stress and complete the roof before the mooring mast's framing. Nevertheless, the essay fails to provide specific details and supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate these claims.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey Saeng's emotional state and her priorities. This conclusion effectively highlights Saeng's resilience and determination. The mention of the spring season, snows melting, and geese returning serves as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of life, emphasizing the idea that Saeng is willing to wait for the right moment to tackle the test again. The hibiscus, which is a symbol of growth and renewal, represents Saeng's connection to her past and her desire to reconnect with her old life. By linking her desire to take the test to the blooming of the hibiscus, the author creates a powerful emotional connection between Saeng's past and present, underscoring her longing for a sense of normalcy and belonging.

Moreover, this paragraph showcases Saeng's introspection and self-awareness. By stating her intention to take the test again when everything is back to normal, Saeng demonstrates her ability to reflect on her situation and set goals for herself. This level of self-awareness is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development, and the author effectively conveys this through Saeng's words.

The author attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but the essay lacks coherence and organization. The text is filled with grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. The author also fails to provide specific examples from the memoir to support their claims. Instead, they rely on vague statements and general ideas. For instance, the author states that the author is ""so greatful"" (should be ""grateful"") for having parents who care about him, but does not provide any evidence from the memoir to support this claim. Furthermore, the author's explanation of the author's happiness at home is based on the author's perception of their parents' cooking and family gatherings, which is not explicitly mentioned in the memoir.

The author also struggles with sentence structure and clarity. The text is filled with simplistic sentences that lack variety and depth. For example, the sentence ""his perents cook cuban food and have There Family together"" is unclear and grammatically incorrect. The author's use of repetition, such as ""That he is so greatfull"" and ""That he is so greatful,"" also detracts from the overall coherence of the essay.

Despite these issues, the author does provide a few moments of insight into the author's feelings and experiences. The quote ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home"" suggests that the author values their home and the relationships they have with their parents. However, this insight is not fully developed or supported by evidence from the memoir.

The essay provided is a personal anecdote about the writer's ability to make people laugh. The writer shares several instances where they used humor to create a lighthearted atmosphere, often at the expense of their friends. While the writer's intention is to showcase their comedic skills, the execution falls short in several areas.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from one story to another without a clear connection between them. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought and understand the significance of each anecdote. The writer could have used transitional phrases or sentences to link the stories together, creating a more cohesive narrative.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on the use of profanity and crude language, which detracts from the overall tone of the essay. While the writer may intend to convey their humor, the use of profanity can be off-putting and may not be suitable for a middle school audience. The writer should consider using more creative and respectful ways to convey their humor.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of abbreviations (e.g., ""i"" instead of ""I,"" ""u"" instead of ""you"") and misspellings (e.g., ""maid"" instead of ""made"") detract from the overall quality of the writing. The writer should strive to use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation to convey their message more effectively.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, echoing the sentiments of Katherine Paterson's quote. The writer argues that individuals have the right to choose what they read and that censorship can lead to a loss of freedom of expression. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on simplistic and general statements.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is its lack of concrete examples and supporting evidence. The writer makes sweeping statements about the impact of censorship on authors and creators, but fails to provide specific instances or anecdotes to illustrate their points. This makes it difficult to fully understand the writer's perspective and to evaluate the strength of their argument.

Furthermore, the essay's tone is often confrontational and dismissive, with the writer implying that those who object to certain materials are simply being ""sensitive"" or ""close-minded."" This approach can be alienating and fails to engage with potential counterarguments. A more effective approach would be to acknowledge the concerns of those who object to certain materials and to engage in a more nuanced discussion of the complexities involved.

Additionally, the writer's use of sentence structure and vocabulary is often simplistic and lacks variety. The writing is often fragmented and lacks cohesion, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. This can make the essay feel disjointed and lacking in polish.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of individual choice to making a blanket statement about the impact of censorship on authors. A more effective approach would be to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect the ideas and create a more logical flow.

Overall, while the essay raises some interesting points about the importance of individual freedom of choice, it falls short in its execution. With more attention to evidence, analysis, and organization, the writer could develop a more compelling and persuasive argument.

The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, drawing on their personal experiences and observations to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to engage the reader with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of resilience and perseverance that are present throughout the story. The author's decision to wait until spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, suggests a connection between the cyclical nature of life and the idea that Saeng will have another chance to succeed.

The use of the hibiscus, a flower that blooms in the spring, serves as a powerful symbol of growth and renewal. By linking her decision to take the test again to the blossoming of the hibiscus, the author emphasizes the idea that Saeng is willing to wait for the right moment to try again. This is further reinforced by the phrase ""when the snows melt,"" which suggests a transformation from a state of dormancy to one of growth and activity.

The author's decision to have Saeng make this vow silently to herself also highlights her inner strength and determination.

The essay presents a well-intentioned but flawed argument against censorship in libraries. The writer attempts to establish a parallel between individual rights and the removal of books from shelves, suggesting that if one person has a right to something, others should also have the same right.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and the idea that even in difficult times, there is always hope for a better future. This conclusion is supported by the author's previous descriptions of the hibiscus, which is a symbol of resilience and renewal. The image of the geese returning in the spring suggests a return to a more vibrant and thriving environment, which contrasts with the difficulties faced by Saeng. The author's use of the word ""vowed"" also implies a sense of determination and resolve, highlighting Saeng's commitment to overcoming her challenges.

Furthermore, the author's intention to take the test again in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding, serves as a metaphor for the idea that even in the darkest moments, there is always a chance for growth and improvement. This conclusion also creates a sense of connection between the reader and Saeng, as it acknowledges that everyone faces difficulties and setbacks, but with perseverance and determination, they can overcome them.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the image of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding, effectively evokes a sense of hope and renewal, making the conclusion feel more personal and relatable. Overall, the author's conclusion effectively ties together the themes of resilience, hope, and determination, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of Saeng's character and her ability to overcome adversity.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument against the benefits of computers on society. They effectively use personal anecdotes and statistics to support their claims, making their opinion more relatable and persuasive. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""@MONTH1"") and allusions to real-life concerns (e.g., online stalking, false information), adds depth to their argument.

However, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The excessive use of abbreviations (e.g., ""@CAPS1"") and slang (e.g., ""alot"") detracts from the overall credibility of the essay. Additionally, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying heavily on hearsay and anecdotal evidence.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can be perceived as alarmist and sensationalized, which may not be convincing to readers who value a more balanced perspective. The writer could have explored alternative solutions to the problems they've identified, such as promoting digital literacy and online safety education, rather than simply dismissing computers altogether.

Overall, while the writer demonstrates a clear passion and conviction, their argument could benefit from more nuanced and evidence-based reasoning, as well as a more formal tone.

The student's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against censorship in libraries. The student effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their stance, highlighting the importance of having a diverse range of materials available for readers. The student's use of phrases such as ""most of it is very helpful information"" and ""I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me"" demonstrates a good understanding of the value of libraries as a resource for learning and exploration.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The student's assertion that ""some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey.

The writer's essay provides a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom of speech and the need for a balanced approach to addressing concerns about offensive materials. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and experiences to support their argument, making the essay more relatable and engaging.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the existence of diverse perspectives and the need for consideration of different viewpoints. The writer recognizes that not everyone may share the same opinions and that it's essential to respect individual differences. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The writer's argument is largely based on personal opinions and experiences, which, while relatable, may not be sufficient to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.

The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of protecting children from exposure to inappropriate material. However, the suggestion to restrict certain areas of the library to adult views only may be overly simplistic and could potentially infringe upon the freedom of access to information for adults. A more balanced approach might involve providing separate sections or guidelines for different age groups, rather than isolating adult materials entirely.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more effective organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly between ideas, and some sentences are worded unclearly or awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the writer could strengthen their argument by providing more concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and raises important points about the importance of individual freedom of speech and the need for balance in addressing concerns about offensive materials.

The essay is well-organized, with three main reasons supporting the claim that computers have a positive impact on people. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to illustrate their points, making the essay more engaging and relatable.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to address counterarguments. The writer acknowledges the concerns of those who believe that computers are detrimental to society, but provides evidence to refute these claims. For instance, the writer highlights the importance of social interactions on the internet, citing examples of people using online platforms to connect with others and access information.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. At times, the writer's arguments feel a bit simplistic, and the supporting evidence is not always convincing. For example, the writer's claim that computers provide access to ""infinite knowledge"" is an exaggeration, and the example of the student who uses the internet to research a report is not a strong counterpoint to the idea that libraries are essential for learning.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The essay is heavy on simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times. Varying sentence length and structure can help to create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. These errors can detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it harder to follow.

Additionally, the writer's arguments are not always well-supported, and some points feel like they are based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence.

The writer also fails to acknowledge the potential harm that some materials can cause, particularly to vulnerable individuals such as children. While they argue that individuals should be able to make their own choices about what they read or watch, they do not consider the potential impact on others.

Furthermore, the writer's approach to resolving the issue of censorship is overly simplistic, suggesting that libraries should only remove materials if more than one person complains. This approach does not take into account the complexities of individual differences and the importance of promoting critical thinking and media literacy.

This quote (""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me"") serves as a vivid representation of the harsh environment, which contributes to the cyclist's confusion.

Moreover, the writer skillfully uses sensory details to describe the setting, such as the temperature of the water in the cyclist's bottle, which is ""@NUM1 degrees.""

The writer also effectively uses descriptive language to describe the terrain, such as the transition from ""@CAPS1 road"" to ""short, rolling hills."" This change in terrain forces the cyclist to work harder and expend more energy, which is a crucial aspect of the story.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from providing more analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotions and thoughts.

The writer's essay raises an important concern about censorship in libraries, highlighting the need to balance freedom of expression with the potential harm caused by certain materials. The writer's personal experience with the movie ""The Captain"" and their distaste for mocking disabilities serve as a compelling argument for censorship. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and well-supported arguments.

One of the writer's main points is that only materials with ""real offensive stuff"" should be censored. While this statement is a good starting point, it is too vague and does not provide clear criteria for what constitutes ""offensive"" content. The writer's example of the movie ""The Captain"" is a good illustration of a problematic film, but it is not a comprehensive argument for censorship. The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of considering the impact of language on individuals with disabilities, but this idea is not fully developed.

The writer's conclusion that ""maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldn't be brought out"" is a good starting point for a more developed argument, but it is not a clear or convincing conclusion. The writer's lack of understanding of the complexities of censorship and the role of librarians in making decisions about what materials to include or exclude on library shelves is also a concern.

To strengthen their argument, the writer could provide more specific examples of materials that they believe should be censored, and explain why they believe these materials are problematic. They could also explore the potential consequences of censorship, such as limiting access to information and stifling free speech. Additionally, the writer could consider the perspectives of librarians and other stakeholders in the debate over censorship, and engage with counterarguments to strengthen their position.

Overall, while the writer raises some important concerns about censorship, their essay could benefit from more development and nuance in its arguments and analysis.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it lacks depth and specificity. The writer relies on general statements such as ""Narciso's mood seemed happy"" without providing concrete evidence from the text to support this claim. The essay also contains grammatical errors, such as ""Narciso's mood sound happy"" and ""his landlord and daughter nice."" Furthermore, the writer fails to analyze the author's use of language, tone, and literary devices that contribute to the overall mood of the memoir.

To effectively describe the mood created by the author, the writer should have provided specific examples from the text, such as the description of the neighborhood as a place where ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship."" The writer could also have analyzed the author's use of words and phrases that convey a sense of warmth and coziness, such as ""his mother and father made the house cozy.""

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it lacks a clear and cohesive structure. The writer seems to jump between different ideas and anecdotes without a logical flow. For instance, the transition from discussing the author's parents' cooking skills to the landlord and his daughter, Alegria, feels abrupt. Additionally, the writer fails to provide specific examples that directly relate to the mood created by the author in the memoir. The statement ""they had no problem finding a house"" is a vague assertion that does not provide concrete evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""I am eternally greatful"" and ""I am great cooks"" comes across as overly simplistic and lacks depth.

The essay provides a clear and relatable discussion on the concept of patience, drawing from the writer's personal experiences and observations. The writer effectively conveys their own struggles with patience and highlights the positive qualities of a patient person through the example of their friend. However, the essay lacks cohesion and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a meandering narrative structure.

The essay provides a clear attempt to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis lacks depth and is heavily reliant on general statements. The writer's use of phrases such as ""the author demonstrated the mood of being laidback very acticulatly"" and ""the mood of being laid back"" are vague and do not provide specific evidence from the text to support their claims.

Furthermore, the writer's use of informal language, such as ""dose"" instead of ""does,"" ""soud"" instead of ""sounds,"" and ""exsample"" instead of ""example,"" detracts from the overall credibility of the analysis. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments or complexities in the author's portrayal of the mood.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion that the mood is ""laid back"" based on the author's use of parenthetical statements and casual conversations with friends and family is not well-supported.

The writer's use of colloquial expressions, such as ""I mean, I can be at times but"" and ""Most of the time…,"" adds a touch of authenticity to the essay. However, the writing lacks cohesion and organization, with the writer jumping abruptly from discussing their own lack of patience to mentioning a specific situation where they can wait.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, with the writer arguing that books should be the primary focus of libraries. The writer's use of personal opinions and experiences, such as the concern that introducing movies and music to libraries would lead to a decline in book sales, adds a layer of authenticity to their argument.

However, the essay lacks a well-structured approach to the topic. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of books to making sweeping statements about the impact of introducing movies and music to libraries. Additionally, the writer's arguments are often based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence. For instance, the claim that people would lose interest in books if movies and music were introduced to libraries is not supported by any specific examples or data.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often confrontational and dismissive, with phrases such as ""I do think that a magazine is a book"" and ""I'm not for that."" This tone detracts from the writer's credibility and makes their argument less persuasive.

The writer could have strengthened their argument by providing more nuanced and evidence-based perspectives on the role of libraries in society. They could have also explored the benefits of introducing movies and music to libraries, such as providing access to diverse forms of media and promoting literacy.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and determination. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and the cyclical nature of life, as evident in the story. The author's decision to set the test for the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, creates a sense of anticipation and renewal, suggesting that Saeng is willing to try again after a setback.

The use of the hibiscus, a flower that blooms in the spring, serves as a symbol of new beginnings and growth. The fact that this particular hibiscus is the one that Saeng had to test on implies that it holds significance for her, and her determination to take the test again is motivated by a desire to succeed with this specific subject. The author's choice of language, such as the phrase ""vowed silently to herself,"" also conveys Saeng's inner resolve and commitment to her goal.

Furthermore, the conclusion effectively leaves the reader with a sense of uncertainty and possibility, as the reader is left wondering whether Saeng will ultimately succeed in taking the test. This ambiguity adds to the story's emotional impact and encourages the reader to reflect on the themes of perseverance and determination.

The essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the impact of computers on society. The writer acknowledges the benefits of computers, such as teaching hand-eye coordination, providing access to information, and enabling online communication. However, they also raise valid concerns about the excessive use of computers, citing the potential negative effects on physical health, social interactions, and mental well-being.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to provide concrete examples to support the writer's claims. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes, such as the example of young teens spending excessive time on computers, to illustrate the issue. Additionally, the writer provides specific examples of how technology has changed the way people shop, communicate, and access information, making the argument more engaging and persuasive.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic.

The essay presents a well-intentioned argument on the topic of censorship in libraries, but it lacks depth and clarity in its presentation. The writer's stance on the issue is not fully developed, and the essay relies heavily on personal opinions and anecdotes rather than concrete evidence and logical reasoning.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer's opening sentence sets up a thought-provoking quote, but it is not effectively used to guide the rest of the essay. The writer's argument is also disjointed, jumping between ideas and failing to provide a cohesive narrative.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often simplistic and lacks sophistication. The writing style is informal and conversational, which may be suitable for a personal blog or social media post, but not for a persuasive essay. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and does not provide evidence to support their claims.

The writer's reliance on personal opinions and anecdotes, such as the example of the ""dunkirk library,"" is also a weakness in the essay. While the anecdote may be relatable, it does not provide a compelling argument for censorship in libraries. The writer's assertion that ""some people would be mad over that"" is also a vague and unconvincing statement.

The essay appears to be a personal anecdote about the writer's brother, who is perceived as loyal. The writer attempts to illustrate their brother's loyalty through various examples, but the essay does not effectively convey the concept of patience.

The writer's use of first-person narration and personal opinions creates a subjective tone, which may not be suitable for a formal essay. The inclusion of phrases like ""I know a person who is always loyal"" and ""I tried to confince him"" suggests a lack of objectivity and may undermine the credibility of the essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of change, growth, and resilience that are woven throughout the narrative. The author skillfully employs the use of natural imagery, specifically the hibiscus and geese, to symbolize Saeng's emotional journey.

The hibiscus, as mentioned in the essay, holds sentimental value for Saeng, reminding her of her childhood in Vietnam. The author cleverly uses this connection to convey Saeng's nostalgia and longing for her homeland. The hibiscus also serves as a metaphor for Saeng's personal growth, as it undergoes a transformation from a dormant state in winter to a blooming flower in spring, much like Saeng's own ability to adapt to her new surroundings.

The geese, which migrate south to escape the cold winter months, symbolize the challenges that Saeng faces as an immigrant. Their return in the spring signifies her readiness to confront and overcome these challenges. The author's use of these natural elements effectively conveys Saeng's emotional state and her determination to move forward.

Furthermore, the author's decision to have Saeng promise herself to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms serves as a powerful symbol of her commitment to self-improvement and perseverance. This conclusion reinforces the idea that change is a natural part of life, and with time, patience, and effort, one can overcome obstacles and grow as an individual.

The use of the word ""whistful"" is not entirely accurate, as it typically connotes a more melancholic or wistful tone. The author also employs a simplistic sentence structure, with short, simple sentences that lack variety and depth.

Overall, while the author demonstrates some understanding of the memoir's themes, their analysis could be more sophisticated and supported by specific textual evidence.

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt, but their analysis of the mood created by the author in the memoir is limited and lacks specific examples from the text. The student's use of transitional phrases such as ""The author knew when to be excited and knew when to not be excited"" and ""The mood went right with it"" is also unclear and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and simplistic sentence structures.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph to convey a sense of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The mention of spring, geese, and the budding hibiscus serves as a nostalgic reminder of a time when the protagonist felt more at home. This is evident in the sentence, ""This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved."" The author's fondness for the geese and the hibiscus is also a significant factor, as it suggests that these elements bring her comfort and a sense of normalcy.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the technical challenges of mooring a dirigible to the safety concerns and finally to the environmental factors. A more cohesive structure would have improved the flow of the essay.

The student provides some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the need to modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate a mooring mast and the safety concerns related to hydrogen being highly flammable. However, the student fails to provide specific details and supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate these claims. For instance, the student mentions that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, but does not provide a direct quote or paraphrase from the excerpt to support this statement.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. The student also relies heavily on the use of the phrase ""on the excerpt,"" which is not necessary and disrupts the flow of the essay.

The author effectively creates a nostalgic and sentimental mood in the memoir by utilizing vivid descriptions of his childhood home and the memories associated with it. The use of phrases such as ""small little @NUM1 room house"" and ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5) evokes a sense of warmth and coziness, drawing the reader into the narrator's reminiscences. The author's emphasis on the shared cooking duties between his parents also highlights the importance of family bonding and the passing down of traditions, further contributing to the nostalgic atmosphere.

However, the analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. For instance, the author could have explored the significance of the house's physical characteristics, such as its location or the surrounding environment, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the setting. Additionally, the transition between the description of the house and the narrator's emotions could be smoother, with more explicit connections made between the two.

Furthermore, the author's use of language is generally clear and concise, but there are some areas where the sentence structure and grammar could be improved. For example, the sentence ""He talks about, how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there are rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5)"" is a bit awkwardly phrased and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey the themes of hope, resilience, and the cyclical nature of life. This conclusion is supported by the events that have transpired in the story. Saeng's family has recently moved to the United States from Vietnam, and she is struggling to adjust to her new environment. Her failure on the driving test is a significant setback, but the author suggests that she is determined to overcome this obstacle.

The mention of the geese returning and the hibiscus blooming in the spring serves as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of life. The geese's annual migration and the hibiscus's blooming are events that are tied to the changing seasons, much like Saeng's journey from failure to success. The author implies that with time, patience, and perseverance, Saeng will be able to overcome her current challenges and achieve her goals.

The use of the phrase ""I will take that test again"" also suggests that Saeng is not giving up, but rather, she is choosing to view her failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. This attitude is reinforced by her decision to plant the hibiscus seeds, which symbolize the potential for new beginnings and renewal.

The author's conclusion effectively ties together the various themes and events in the story, providing a sense of closure and hope for the reader. The use of vivid imagery and symbolism adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making the conclusion a satisfying and meaningful ending to the story.

The essay presents a thought-provoking discussion on the topic of censorship in libraries, encouraging readers to consider the importance of individual freedom and the role of personal opinions in shaping one's perspective. The writer effectively employs personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their argument, making the essay more relatable and engaging.

One of the essay's strengths lies in its ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue, recognizing that what may be considered offensive to one person may not be to another. The writer skillfully highlights the importance of respecting individual differences in opinions and beliefs, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics like religious beliefs and personal freedom. The use of phrases such as ""you know what is right and wrong"" and ""I have my own state of mind and so do you"" effectively conveys the writer's emphasis on personal autonomy.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly between different ideas, and some paragraphs feel disconnected from one another. Additionally, the writing could be more polished, with more attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence-level clarity. For instance, the sentence ""You @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree and we have others who do not care"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better comprehension.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more concrete examples to support their argument. While the anecdote about the writer's own experiences with experimentation is engaging, it feels somewhat disconnected from the main topic of censorship in libraries.

However, the writer's approach to addressing this issue is somewhat simplistic and lacks a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to express their opinion clearly and concisely. They provide specific examples of books and magazines that they believe should be removed from the library, and their reasoning is based on their own experiences and observations. However, their argument relies heavily on personal opinions and emotions, rather than a thorough analysis of the issue.

The essay provides a clear and relatable example of the concept of patience, albeit in a somewhat simplistic and fragmented manner. The student attempts to illustrate patience through their personal experience, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks cohesion. The student's writing style is characterized by the use of abbreviations (e.g., ""meap,"" ""@NUM1,"" ""@CAPS1"") and incomplete sentences, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The student's attempt to explain the benefits of patience, such as getting good grades, is also somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The writing could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the concept of patience and its applications.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to make the narrative more engaging and immersive. The student's writing style is more akin to a series of disconnected thoughts rather than a cohesive essay.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the student's personal experience to making general statements about the importance of patience. A more logical structure and transitions between paragraphs would improve the flow and coherence of the essay.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, it requires significant improvement in terms of writing quality, organization, and depth of analysis.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The introduction is somewhat vague, and the student jumps abruptly into discussing the obstacles without providing a clear direction for the essay.

The student provides some relevant information about the hazards of nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and European dirigibles. The mention of violent wind currents and the potential danger to pedestrians is a good point, but it is not fully developed. The student also correctly identifies the issue with the weight of the dirigible pressing on the building and the potential cost of repairs. However, the connection between this point and the overall thesis is unclear.

The student also raises a valid concern about the flammability of European dirigibles, but this point is not fully supported by evidence from the excerpt. The mention of a German dirigible being damaged by fire is not present in the provided excerpt.

The conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The student states that the dangers associated with using dirigibles outweigh the benefits, but this is not a clear or well-supported conclusion.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph, skillfully weaving together the themes of Saeng's past, present, and future. The inclusion of the hibiscus, a symbol of her new home, and the geese, which she finds ""almost familiar,"" serves as a poignant reminder of her growth and acceptance of her new surroundings. The author's decision to place these elements in the final paragraph creates a sense of closure and resolution, as Saeng's determination to retake the driving test is now infused with a newfound sense of confidence and belonging. The use of sensory details, such as the melting snow and the return of the geese, effectively ties the narrative together, creating a cohesive and satisfying conclusion.

The author's conclusion also highlights Saeng's emotional journey, as she transitions from feeling lost and overwhelmed to finding comfort in the familiar sights and sounds of her new home. The phrase ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes"" at the beginning of the story serves as a powerful contrast to the sense of calm and determination that pervades the final paragraph.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue. The writer recognizes that there are books and materials that may be offensive to certain individuals or groups, but also emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and the need for a balanced approach to censorship.

The writer's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument on the topic of censorship in libraries. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of freedom of expression and the need to respect individual perspectives. However, the writer's argument is somewhat marred by a lack of depth and supporting evidence. The writer's personal experience and observations are limited, and the essay relies heavily on general statements and assumptions.

One of the major issues with the essay is the writer's failure to provide concrete examples or specific instances where they have seen censorship in action. The writer's assertion that they have never seen anything that has offended them at the public library is not convincing, as it is unlikely that they have visited every book on every shelf. Furthermore, the writer's statement that libraries are there for ""public reading and the growth of knowledge"" is a vague and overly broad claim that does not address the complexities of censorship.

Additionally, the writer's suggestion that libraries should remove books that cause a ""big issue"" and ""many people are constantly bringing up the problem"" is problematic. This approach implies that the writer believes that the majority's opinion should dictate what books are allowed in the library, rather than a nuanced consideration of the content and context of the material. This approach can lead to a slippery slope where books are removed based on popular opinion rather than a thoughtful evaluation of their value and relevance.

Furthermore, the writer's statement that librarians do not intentionally put books that offend the public on display is not supported by evidence. While it is true that librarians strive to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment, it is also their responsibility to ensure that the materials they select are relevant and respectful to the community they serve.

In conclusion, while the writer raises some valid points about the importance of freedom of expression and the need to respect individual perspectives, their essay lacks depth, evidence, and nuance. To strengthen their argument, the writer should provide more specific examples, engage with counterarguments, and consider the complexities of censorship in a more thoughtful and nuanced way.

However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the technical challenges to the legal restrictions, without providing a cohesive narrative.

The student provides some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the need for a mooring mast to be strengthened and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. However, the supporting details are often vague and lack concrete evidence from the excerpt. For instance, the student claims that the architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because it would only be held by a single cable tether, but this is not explicitly stated in the excerpt.

Furthermore, the student's writing style is often informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation. The use of phrases such as ""One reason is because"" and ""And the one way to solve it would be"" disrupts the flow of the essay and makes it difficult to follow.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps between different ideas without providing a logical connection between them. The essay could benefit from a clearer introduction, body, and conclusion.

Overall, while the student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, grammar, and evidence-based support.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks specific details and supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate the claims made. The student provides some relevant information, such as the use of hydrogen by dirigibles, but fails to provide concrete evidence from the excerpt to support this claim. Additionally, the student's explanation for the law against airships flying too low over urban areas is not supported by the provided excerpt.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but lacks depth and analysis. The transitions between sentences are smooth, but the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking between ideas. The student also fails to address the issue of the mooring mast being too tall, which is mentioned in the excerpt as a reason for the builders to modify the building's frames.

To improve, the student should focus on providing specific evidence from the excerpt to support their claims, and analyze the information more deeply. They should also work on developing more cohesive transitions between ideas and addressing all the obstacles mentioned in the excerpt.

The writer's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. The writer's passion for the topic is evident throughout the essay, and their use of rhetorical devices such as repetition (""Through the use of computers..."") and metaphors (""the pain those children suffer"") adds depth and emotion to their argument.

However, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of slang terms (""grow"", ""wandering"", ""playerl""), grammatical errors (""Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores?""), and lack of transitions between paragraphs make the essay feel somewhat disjointed. Additionally, the writer's tone can come across as overly defensive and argumentative, with phrases such as ""You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane"" detracting from the overall credibility of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide a clear and nuanced exploration of the opposing viewpoint. While they acknowledge the concerns of those who believe that excessive computer use is detrimental to society, they do not engage with these concerns in a meaningful way. This lack of counterargumentation makes the essay feel somewhat one-sided and lacking in depth.

In terms of content, the writer provides some interesting and relevant examples, such as their personal experience with basketball and the impact of computers on their hand-eye coordination. However, these examples are not always well-integrated into the larger argument, and the writer could have explored them more thoroughly.

However, the essay lacks a clear and cohesive structure, and the student fails to provide a thorough analysis of the obstacles. The student provides some relevant information, such as the potential danger posed by large dirigibles and the need to modify the building's steel frame. Nevertheless, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, lack of supporting evidence, and a failure to address the issue of hydrogen being highly flammable.

The student's statement that ""some of the obstacles the builders ran into"" is vague and does not provide any concrete examples. Furthermore, the student's use of phrases such as ""some of the obstacles the builders ran into"" and ""some of the obstacles the builders faced"" is redundant and does not contribute to a clear and concise argument.

The essay provided does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of patience. The writer seems to use the term ""patient"" in a way that is not accurately reflective of its meaning. The writer's use of the word ""patsiants"" in the last sentence is particularly concerning, as it appears to be a misspelling or misuse of the word.

The essay lacks coherence and organization, with the writer jumping abruptly from describing someone being patient to making a personal anecdote about ordering food. The transition between these ideas is unclear, and the writer fails to provide any concrete examples or evidence to support their claim about patience.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simplistic and lacks grammatical sophistication. The use of abbreviations (e.g. ""I saw someone @CAPS1"") and incomplete sentences (e.g. ""I orderd my food"") detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In terms of content, the essay fails to provide any meaningful insights or reflections on what it means to be patient. The writer's anecdote about someone else being patient does not demonstrate an understanding of the concept, and the writer's conclusion about ""patsiants"" is not supported by any evidence.

The writer effectively utilizes personal opinions and observations to support their position, such as the idea that parents should be in charge of what their children read and that not all people agree on censorship. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on simplistic and general statements.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the diversity of opinions on censorship, recognizing that not everyone will agree on what is acceptable. The writer also highlights the importance of parents being in charge of their children's reading material, which is a valid concern. However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support these claims.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences is also noteworthy, as it helps to connect ideas and create a cohesive flow.

The essay demonstrates a clear structure, starting with a general statement about the benefits of laughter, followed by a personal story, and concluding with a reflection on the impact of laughter on their relationship.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's emotions and thoughts in a clear and concise manner. The writer uses vivid language, such as ""the funnest time I had ever had with my mom,"" to describe their experience, making the reader feel invested in their story. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""In the beginning,"" helps to guide the reader through the narrative.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. Some sentences, such as ""I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do,"" feel a bit generic and could be rephrased for more impact. Furthermore, the writer could provide more context about the specific situation and the emotions involved, making the story more engaging and relatable.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. There are several instances of run-on sentences, missing articles, and incorrect verb tenses.

The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the scene, making it easy for the reader to visualize the events. For instance, the phrase ""his little bro"" and ""the hot tub"" effectively convey the setting and atmosphere of the story.

However, the essay lacks cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the plan for the day to the incident with the phone, and then to the aftermath. This disjointed structure makes it difficult to follow the narrative flow. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the significance of the phone and its importance in the story.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are numerous errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, ""spencers mom"" should be ""Spencer's mom,"" and ""i"" should be ""I."" Furthermore, the writer often uses informal language and slang, which may not be suitable for a formal essay.

Despite these issues, the writer's enthusiasm and creativity shine through in the essay. The anecdote about the phone incident is humorous and engaging, and the writer's use of humor is effective in conveying the importance of laughter in relationships.

To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear and cohesive narrative structure, proofreading their work for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors, and using more formal language.

The writer's essay presents a well-structured argument on the negative effects of computers on society, supported by various points and examples. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and statistics from reputable sources to substantiate their claims, making the argument more convincing. However, the writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary, as some sentences are simplistic and lack clarity.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and address multiple concerns, such as the presence of inappropriate content, the potential for online harassment, and the negative impact on social relationships. The writer also provides specific examples, like the story of their brother's addiction to computer games, to illustrate the consequences of excessive internet use.

However, the essay could benefit from more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the negative effects of computers to discussing their personal experience with their brother's addiction. Additionally, some sentences are repetitive, and the writer could have used more varied sentence structures to improve the overall flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have delved deeper into the implications of these issues and provided more concrete solutions to mitigate the negative effects of computers on society. While the writer raises important concerns, the essay feels somewhat superficial and lacks a clear call to action.

The student's essay provides a relatable and engaging narrative about the importance of laughter in relationships. The anecdote about the student's friendship with their classmate, where they shared jokes and laughter during gym class, effectively illustrates the significance of humor in building and maintaining strong relationships. The student's personal experience and vivid description of the situation make the story more believable and memorable.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization.

Additionally, the student could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. While the essay conveys the student's enthusiasm and conviction, the vocabulary and sentence structure are often simplistic and lack variety. Incorporating more complex sentence structures, metaphors, and descriptive language would elevate the writing quality and make it more engaging for the reader.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more critical thinking and analysis. While the essay provides some insightful observations about the impact of laughter on relationships, it primarily relies on personal anecdotes and surface-level observations. Developing more in-depth analysis and supporting evidence from other sources would strengthen the essay's arguments and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.

The essay fails to provide concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support the author's claims.

The essay also demonstrates a lack of understanding of the concept of censorship. The author seems to conflate the issue of censorship with personal taste, implying that what is objectionable to one person is not necessarily objectionable to another.

The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a balanced view of the topic. For example, they do not acknowledge the benefits of computers in education, communication, or other areas where technology can have a positive impact. This lack of nuance and critical thinking skills detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize their main points. The sentence ""As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit?"" seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the essay.

Overall, while the writer shows promise in presenting a clear and relatable argument, their writing style and lack of evidence hold them back from producing a more effective essay.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The student provides specific examples of the challenges, such as the need to modify and strengthen the building's frame, the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles, and the existing law against airships flying too low. However, the student could benefit from providing more depth and analysis of these obstacles. For instance, the student could have explored the potential consequences of a dirigible accident above a densely populated city like New York, or discussed the impact of the wind currents on the mooring mast.

Additionally, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. The writing is clear and concise, but some sentences feel disconnected from each other. The student also could have used more precise vocabulary to describe the obstacles, such as ""unstable"" instead of ""violent"" to describe the air currents.

Overall, the student shows potential in identifying the obstacles faced by the builders, but could benefit from further development and refinement in their writing.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey a sense of hope and determination in the protagonist, Saeng. This conclusion effectively reinforces the themes of perseverance and renewal that are present throughout the narrative. The author's use of sensory details, such as the blooming of the hibiscus, serves to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and the promise of new beginnings. The phrase ""when they come back"" suggests that Saeng is waiting for a specific event or occasion, likely the return of her family or a significant figure, which will serve as a catalyst for her to take the test again. The author's choice of the spring season, with its connotations of renewal and growth, further underscores the idea that Saeng is seeking a fresh start.

The author's use of language is also noteworthy, as the phrase ""I will take that test again"" is a clear expression of determination and resolve. The tone of the paragraph is hopeful and optimistic, which is reinforced by the use of words such as ""vowed"" and ""budding,"" which convey a sense of promise and potential. Overall, the conclusion effectively ties together the narrative threads and provides a sense of closure and resolution for the protagonist.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable stance on censorship in libraries, drawing from their personal experiences and observations. The use of a quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay and highlights the importance of individual freedom of expression. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed arguments to support the student's position.

One of the strengths of the essay is its organization and coherence. The student has effectively grouped related ideas together, making it easy to follow their train of thought. The use of transitional phrases, such as ""Again parents do not want to see,"" helps to connect the ideas and create a sense of flow.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of censorship and its implications. They correctly identify the types of materials that may be considered offensive, such as books, music, and movies, and propose potential solutions for addressing these issues. However, the student's arguments could be more convincing if they were supported by more evidence and examples.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. The writing is often simplistic and lacks variety, which can make it difficult to follow at times. For example, the sentence ""Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether"" could be rephrased for greater clarity and impact.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more critical thinking and analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. While they acknowledge the importance of protecting children from explicit content, they do not fully consider the potential impact on freedom of expression and the value of diverse perspectives.

The author attempts to convey a positive mood in the memoir, suggesting that love is the dominant emotion. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The author relies on general statements such as ""all that was being talked about was 'eternal @CAPS1', 'a dore', bonds, and unity"" without providing specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support their claim. This lack of evidence makes the argument less convincing. Furthermore, the author's interpretation of the author's motivations is also oversimplified, stating that only a ""loving parent"" would make such a sacrifice. This assumption does not take into account the complexities of human decision-making and the various factors that may influence an individual's choices.

Additionally, the writing could benefit from more precise language and organization. The text is disjointed, with sentences that seem to be loosely connected.

The writer effectively uses specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion, such as the description of the dry and hilly land, the lack of access to food, water, or civilization, and the impact of the heat on the main character. However, the writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the sentences could be more varied in terms of structure and length.

One area for improvement is in the use of precise vocabulary and sentence structure.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the main character. While the writer mentions that the setting is hot, dry, and deserted, they do not fully explore the psychological and emotional effects of this environment on the main character.

The writer's primary argument is that computers have a predominantly positive effect on people, citing various benefits such as socialization, entertainment, and education. The writer effectively uses examples from social media platforms, online games, and websites to support their claim. For instance, they highlight the ability to connect with friends and family through social networking sites like Twitter and YouTube, as well as the numerous free games available online that can be played for hours without incurring any costs. The writer also addresses the concern about excessive screen time by suggesting that it is a personal choice and that individuals can balance their computer use with physical activity.

However, the writer's argument is not without its weaknesses. While they acknowledge the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, they do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the negative effects of computers on people. For example, they do not discuss the impact of computer addiction, cyberbullying, or the potential effects of prolonged screen time on physical and mental health. Furthermore, the writer's tone can come across as dismissive of opposing views, with phrases such as ""the idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic argument."" This tone may alienate readers who hold differing opinions.

Additionally, the writer's use of all-caps text and excessive punctuation can be distracting and detract from the overall coherence of the essay. While the writer attempts to use these features to emphasize certain points, they can also make the text appear spammy or attention-seeking.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to emphasize the themes of resilience and growth. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the hibiscus plant in the previous paragraphs, which is characterized as weak and delicate, as evident from the quote ""Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This contrast between the plant's fragility and Saeng's determination to care for it highlights her own vulnerabilities and the potential for growth.

Moreover, the author's use of the hibiscus as a symbol for Saeng is reinforced by the fact that the plant's growth is tied to the changing seasons, specifically the arrival of spring. The author's decision to wait until spring to take the test again suggests that Saeng is willing to take her time to nurture and grow, much like the hibiscus plant. This parallel between the plant's growth and Saeng's personal growth underscores the idea that with care and patience, she can overcome her challenges.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the author's intentions and the symbolism of the hibiscus. The conclusion feels somewhat simplistic, and the connections between the plant and Saeng's character could be more explicitly explored.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging narrative about the author's experience with patience during a soccer game. The use of first-person pronouns and vivid descriptions, such as ""Whistle, whistle"" and ""I was losing my patience,"" effectively convey the author's emotions and thoughts during the game. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The transitions between ideas are abrupt, and the story jumps abruptly from the author's frustration to the realization about their coach's preference for the opposing team.

The author's use of humor, such as the mention of wearing a ""state tattoo on my face,"" adds a lighthearted touch to the essay. However, it feels somewhat out of place and disrupts the flow of the narrative. The essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar and mechanics, such as subject-verb agreement and punctuation.

One of the strengths of the essay is the author's ability to convey their emotions and thoughts in a clear and concise manner. The use of rhetorical devices, such as alliteration (""Whistle, whistle""), effectively engages the reader and adds to the overall tone of the essay.

To improve the essay, the author should focus on developing a more cohesive narrative structure, using transitional phrases to connect ideas, and refining sentence-level grammar and mechanics.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis lacks depth and specificity. The student attempts to convey the author's gratitude towards their parents, but the explanation is overly simplistic and lacks concrete evidence from the memoir to support the claim. The sentence ""That's the mood of the author in the memoir"" is also vague and doesn't provide any insight into the author's thought process or literary devices used to convey the mood.

To improve, the student should provide more detailed analysis of specific passages or events in the memoir that illustrate the author's happiness and gratitude. For example, they could discuss how the author describes their parents' actions or words that convey their appreciation, or analyze the tone and language used to convey the mood.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary. Using phrases like ""happiness and grateful"" is a good start, but the student could use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the mood in the memoir.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses various examples to support their claim, such as the ability to socialize with people across the globe, access to educational resources, and practical uses like managing finances and accessing information. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in addressing the opposing viewpoint. The writer dismisses concerns about excessive computer use without providing a thoughtful response.

The writing is generally clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""have hurt anyone?"" and ""because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors."" The writer also relies heavily on clichéd expressions like ""the world is your oyster"" and ""think, are computers really harmful?"" to conclude the essay.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that computers allow people to learn about faraway places and people, but they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this statement. Additionally, the writer's tone can come across as overly simplistic and lacking in critical thinking.

The essay provides a personal anecdote about the writer's experience waiting for a newborn child, which is a relatable and engaging topic. However, the writing quality is marred by several issues. The use of slang terms such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@NUM1"" detract from the overall coherence and professionalism of the essay. The writer's use of all caps for emphasis (""@CAPS1"") is not suitable for formal writing and disrupts the flow of the narrative.

Furthermore, the writer's thoughts and feelings are not clearly articulated, and the writing lacks depth and analysis. The writer's emotions are primarily expressed through actions, such as smoking and ignoring the nurses, rather than through descriptive language or introspection. This makes it difficult to fully understand the writer's emotional state and the significance of the experience.

Additionally, the writer's use of incomplete sentences and fragmented thoughts (""I just @CAPS1 a puff of smoke, and waited for hours"") creates a sense of disjointedness and makes it challenging to follow the narrative.

Despite these issues, the essay does convey a sense of desperation and anxiety, which is a common experience for many people waiting for a newborn child. The writer's use of sensory details, such as the sound of the baby crying, effectively evokes a strong emotional response.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on using more descriptive language, articulating their thoughts and feelings more clearly, and using complete sentences to create a more cohesive narrative.

The author effectively uses the concluding paragraph to convey Saeng's emotional growth and her commitment to adapting to her new home. By mentioning the specific details of the natural world, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, the author creates a vivid image of the changing seasons and Saeng's emotional state. This juxtaposition highlights the contrast between Saeng's past and present, emphasizing her desire to move forward and leave her old life behind. The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of determination and resolve, underscoring Saeng's commitment to taking the test again.

The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph also serves to underscore Saeng's emotional vulnerability and her struggle to cope with her new surroundings. The fact that Saeng is able to make a vow to herself, but is still overcome with emotion, suggests that she is still grappling with her feelings and is not yet fully adjusted to her new home. This nuance adds depth to the story and raises questions about Saeng's future and her ability to truly let go of her past.

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is rooted in the belief that everyone deserves to be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their background, skin color, or personal characteristics.

For instance, the statement ""I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone"" effectively conveys the writer's desire for a safe and inclusive environment.

However, the writer's argument is not without its flaws. At times, their language and tone come across as overly simplistic and lacking in nuance. For example, the statement ""Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good"" oversimplifies the issue of censorship and fails to acknowledge the complexity of the problem. Additionally, the writer's assertion that ""harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others"" is a vague and unsubstantiated claim that lacks concrete evidence to support it.

The student's essay attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but it lacks a clear and focused thesis statement. The essay jumps between different points, such as the law preventing airships from reaching urban areas, the potential for wind to cause the airships to swing around, and the safety concerns related to hydrogen. However, these points are not fully developed or supported with specific evidence from the excerpt.

The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For example, the sentence ""For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas"" should be rephrased to ""For example, airships were prevented from reaching low-lying urban areas by a law.""

Furthermore, the student fails to provide specific examples or quotes from the excerpt to support their claims. The statement ""They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below"" is unclear and lacks context. The student also misidentifies the location of the airship in New Jersey as being destroyed by fire, when in fact, it was the Hindenburg airship that was destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

The essay effectively conveys the writer's personal experience with their father's excessive computer use leading to weight gain, as well as the writer's own experiences with missing out on outdoor activities and social interactions. The writer also raises concerns about the potential consequences of excessive computer use, such as decreased physical activity, social isolation, and decreased exploration of the world.

However, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported thesis statement, and the writer's arguments are often based on personal anecdotes rather than concrete evidence. The writer also relies heavily on rhetorical questions and exclamations, which can come across as persuasive rather than persuasive. Furthermore, the writer's tone is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a formal letter to the newspaper.

Additionally, the writer's use of slang and abbreviations (e.g. ""benifit"", ""gisers"", ""buitful"") detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction could be improved by providing more context and a clear direction for the reader.

The student has provided some relevant information about the Hindenburg disaster and its impact on the dirigible travel. The mention of the Hindenburg's use of hydrogen gas is a good example of how the builders overlooked a crucial issue. However, the student could have delved deeper into the consequences of this oversight and its implications for the Empire State Building project.

The student also touches on the issue of airship laws and the proximity of the mast to the densely populated city. However, the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks concrete evidence to support the claim. The mention of test runs and strong winds is a good attempt to provide more context, but it is not enough to fully address the issue.

The student's writing style is generally clear, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the sentence ""The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another buildings spire put fear into the minds of the people"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, echoing the sentiments of Katherine Paterson. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and accessible to a middle school audience.

One of the essay's strengths lies in its ability to acknowledge the subjective nature of offense. The writer recognizes that people have different perspectives and opinions, which is a crucial aspect of the debate.

For instance, the writer could explore the impact on freedom of expression, the role of libraries as a hub for intellectual exploration, and the potential for censorship to stifle critical thinking.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is clear and concise, but there are areas where grammar, spelling, and punctuation could be improved. For example, the sentence ""Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing"" could be rephrased for better clarity. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the overall flow and sophistication of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay follows a logical structure, starting with a clear thesis statement and supporting it with relevant examples. However, the writer could consider adding more transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs and make the essay feel more cohesive.

The image of the snows melting and the geese returning suggests a return to a sense of normalcy and familiarity, which is fitting for Saeng's desire to reconnect with her roots. The inclusion of the hibiscus, a flower native to her homeland, further emphasizes the connection between Saeng's past and present.

The final sentence, ""then I will take that test again,"" is a poignant expression of Saeng's determination to move forward and take control of her life. By stating that she will take the test again, Saeng is, in effect, saying that she is ready to face the challenges of her new life head-on. This conclusion is a testament to the author's ability to craft a narrative that is both hopeful and empowering.

The writer's argument on censorship in libraries is a thought-provoking and relatable topic, drawing from personal experiences and observations. The essay effectively conveys the writer's perspective on the issue, presenting both sides of the debate. However, the writer's writing style and organization could be improved for a more convincing and polished essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their argument. The comparison between segregation and the impact of media on society is a powerful tool in making the writer's point. The writer also raises a valid concern about the importance of having diverse perspectives and the potential consequences of removing all potentially offensive content.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer's argument is not well-supported by evidence, and the writer relies heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning. The writer's conclusion is also somewhat ambiguous, as they seem to waver between the two extremes of removing everything that offends anyone and not removing anything that offends anyone. A more nuanced approach would be to explore the gray areas and propose a balanced solution.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks clarity. The use of phrases such as ""I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people"" and ""it's almost like when people were segregated by race"" can be confusing and detract from the writer's argument. The writer could benefit from more precise language and a more logical structure.

Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments and acknowledges that the writer's position is not a clear-cut one. A stronger essay would engage with opposing viewpoints and demonstrate a more thorough understanding of the complexities involved.

Overall, while the writer shows promise, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, evidence, and logical reasoning.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph to emphasize the girl's determination and growth throughout the narrative. The author skillfully weaves in the details of the story to support this interpretation. For instance, the author mentions that the girl initially bought the expensive flower to avoid disappointing her mother, showcasing her initial willingness to make sacrifices for others. However, the girl's determination to ""pass the test"" in the spring, when she can afford to buy seeds, highlights her developing sense of self-reliance and independence. This conclusion reinforces the idea that the girl has matured and is now capable of making her own decisions, rather than relying on others to make sacrifices for her. The author's use of the season ""spring"" and the image of the hibiscus blooming also adds a sense of renewal and new beginnings, underscoring the girl's growth and transformation.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to mentioning Al Smith's decision to increase the building's height, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

The student provides some relevant information about the challenges of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building, such as the strong wind current and the weight of the dirigible, which could cause the building to collapse. However, these points are not fully developed and lack supporting evidence from the excerpt.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's passion and conviction about the power of laughter. The use of rhetorical devices, such as the quote ""A life without laughter is a life not spent,"" adds a touch of depth and emotion to the essay. However, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language to elevate the tone and style of the essay.

The writer's use of sentence structure and organization is generally clear, but there are instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with @CAPS1 a couple of words."" This sentence could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to support their claims. While the anecdote about the comedian is amusing, it feels somewhat disconnected from the main argument. Additionally, the writer could explore more theoretical perspectives on the benefits of laughter to add depth and complexity to the essay.

The student's essay raises an important point about the importance of access to various forms of media in libraries. However, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported argument, and the writing quality is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to address the prompt directly. The student's use of first-person pronouns and colloquial expressions (""I know alot,"" ""I couldn't handle it,"" ""I'm thinking you would be really bored"") detract from the persuasive tone and make the essay feel more like a personal opinion rather than a well-reasoned argument.

The student's assertion that removing music, movies, and magazines would lead to boredom is a valid concern, but it is not a strong enough argument to support their position. The student fails to provide any evidence or examples to illustrate the impact of censorship on individuals or society, and their reasoning is based on a simplistic and anecdotal approach.

Furthermore, the student's tone is inconsistent, veering wildly from a casual, conversational tone to a more formal, persuasive tone. This inconsistency makes it difficult to take the student's argument seriously. Additionally, the student's use of all capital letters and excessive punctuation marks (""I dont think,"" ""I know alot of people"") detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

To strengthen their argument, the student should focus on providing clear and concise evidence to support their position, using more formal language and avoiding colloquial expressions.

The writer presents a clear and passionate stance against censorship in libraries, citing concerns about the potential impact of offensive materials on children and the community. The essay effectively uses personal anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the writer's points, making the argument more relatable and engaging.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue. The writer recognizes that censorship may not be a simple solution, but rather a means to address the problems it aims to solve. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and evidence-based arguments to support its claims. For instance, the writer could have explored the concept of freedom of expression and the importance of intellectual diversity in libraries.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""more than likely,"" ""if you really wanted it"") and emotive language (""I would be very upset,"" ""negative outlook on our society""), adds to the persuasive power of the essay. However, some of these devices may come across as overly simplistic or manipulative, undermining the writer's credibility.

The essay could also benefit from more attention to organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly between ideas, and some paragraphs feel disconnected from the rest of the essay. A clearer structure and transitions between paragraphs would improve the flow and overall effectiveness of the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's reliance on hypothetical scenarios and personal opinions may limit the essay's persuasiveness. While personal anecdotes can be powerful tools for argumentation, they may not be convincing for readers who disagree with the writer's views. A more balanced approach, incorporating diverse perspectives and evidence from credible sources, would strengthen the essay's argument.

The writer presents a well-structured and thought-provoking essay on the topic of censorship in libraries, effectively addressing the complexities of freedom of speech and the role of media in shaping our understanding of the world. The writer's personal experience with reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee serves as a compelling example of how literature can challenge our perspectives and foster empathy and understanding.

One of the writer's strengths is their ability to acknowledge the existence of differing opinions and perspectives, as evident in their discussion of the various themes and ideas presented in different books, music, and movies. The writer's argument that censorship can limit personal growth and exploration of interests is well-supported by their own experience with the novel, which they describe as a ""masterpiece"" that taught them about the progress of acceptance in the United States.

However, the writer's essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. While they effectively argue that censorship can limit individual freedom, they do not fully explore the potential harm that certain materials can cause to vulnerable individuals or communities. For example, they mention the explicit racist language in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" but do not discuss the potential impact on readers who may be exposed to such language.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat simplistic, stating that it is best to ""just keep things the way they are - free."" While this sentiment is understandable, it does not fully address the complexities of the issue. A more thoughtful conclusion might acknowledge the need for balance between freedom of expression and the need to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from harm.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear and persuasive argument. However, further development of their ideas and consideration of potential counterarguments would strengthen their essay.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from the provided quote by Katherine Paterson. The writer effectively conveys their stance against book censorship, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of removing books from library shelves.

One of the essay's strengths lies in its ability to acknowledge the concerns of parents who may object to certain materials, but also highlights the potential drawbacks of censorship. The writer's suggestion of creating a separate section for objectionable books or implementing a permission slip system is a pragmatic approach that balances parental concerns with the need for students to have access to diverse literature.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed arguments. The writer's responses to counterarguments, such as the potential impact on students who enjoy reading objectionable books, feel somewhat superficial.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, echoing the sentiments of Katherine Paterson's quote. However, the writing lacks depth and coherence, with several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall impact of the argument.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The writer seems to be arguing against censorship, but the reasons provided are not well-organized or well-supported. The writer mentions that children can find inappropriate material in the children's section, but this point is not fully developed or linked to the main argument. Furthermore, the writer's tone is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay.

The writer also fails to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claims. The mention of a book being used in a health or nursing class is a good starting point, but it is not fully explored or developed. Additionally, the writer's assertion that it is hard to come across an inappropriate book without looking for it on purpose is not a convincing argument.

The writer's writing style is also marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structure.

The writer's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the need for balance in library collections. The writer's personal experience and observations are evident in their discussion of the various genres of books, music, and movies, and how they cater to different age groups.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer's reasoning for separating explicit content from children's materials is understandable, but it lacks concrete evidence and logical connections. For instance, the writer states that children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand, but this assertion is not supported by any specific examples or data.

Furthermore, the writer's suggestion that all media should be categorized into separate sections based on age groups oversimplifies the issue of censorship. Libraries are not just about protecting children from explicit content, but also about providing access to diverse perspectives, ideas, and experiences that can enrich their lives. By separating media into age-based categories, the writer risks creating a narrow and restrictive environment that stifles intellectual curiosity and critical thinking.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion that books should be left on the shelves regardless of their content is overly simplistic and fails to acknowledge the complexities of the issue. Libraries are not just repositories of books, but also spaces for community engagement, education, and socialization. Censorship is not just about protecting children from explicit content, but also about creating a safe and inclusive environment that promotes respect for diverse perspectives and opinions.

To improve their writing, the writer should focus on developing their arguments with concrete evidence and examples, using more formal language, and maintaining a consistent tone. Additionally, they should consider revising their structure to improve clarity and coherence.

The author effectively conveys a sense of unity and happiness in the memoir, highlighting the importance of family and cultural heritage. The use of specific examples, such as the author's appreciation for his parents' love and sacrifice, and his gratitude for the lessons learned from his family, demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of family beyond biological ties. The author's description of the heart of his home being the kitchen, where he learned to cook and shared meals with his community, effectively conveys a sense of warmth and togetherness. However, the writing could benefit from more nuanced and varied sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary to enhance the overall impact of the narrative. Additionally, some sentences feel a bit simplistic, such as ""He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents."" The word ""selfnassless"" is not a valid word, and it disrupts the otherwise cohesive tone of the essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The student effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. The student also addresses potential counterarguments by mentioning concerns about excessive computer use, but fails to provide a convincing response.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The student relies heavily on simplistic and superficial examples, such as the football player's ping-pong skills, to support their points. The essay also contains grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. Furthermore, the student fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, instead relying on personal opinions and assumptions.

The student's writing style is also marred by a lack of organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from one topic to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are often unclear. The student also fails to address potential counterarguments in a thoughtful and well-reasoned manner.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging account of a personal experience with patience, making it easy for the reader to connect with the writer's emotions and thoughts. The writer effectively uses vivid descriptions to paint a picture of the scene, such as ""I was so greatful [sic] I could not fall asleep"" and ""I was??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4."" However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One major issue is the lack of clear and concise writing. The essay is filled with grammatical errors, such as ""I was in shock. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am"" and ""I was trerd, trerd, and cooking in the sun."" The writer also uses informal language and slang, like ""humumus"" and ""defidintly,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Additionally, the writer fails to provide a clear and well-structured narrative. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the initial excitement of going to Cedar Point to the breakdown of the ride, and then to the food and the rest of the day. A more cohesive structure would have helped to create a smoother flow of ideas.

The author effectively creates a range of moods in the memoir, skillfully transitioning between comfort, sympathy, and a sense of family. The opening paragraphs establish a warm and inviting tone, as the author describes fond memories of home and family, evoking feelings of comfort and security in the reader. The use of phrases such as ""I felt especially warm inside"" and ""I'll always be grateful to my parents"" effectively convey the author's positive emotions. However, the introduction of the author's parents' hardships and sacrifices marks a significant shift in the mood, as the tone darkens and the reader is filled with a sense of sympathy. The author's expression of gratitude and appreciation for his family's love and care is a powerful moment, as it reinforces the sense of family and creates a sense of closure.

The author's ability to balance these contrasting moods is impressive, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the complexities of human emotions. The use of transitional phrases, such as ""However,"" helps to guide the reader through the emotional journey, making the experience more engaging and relatable. The author's writing style is clear and concise, making it easy to follow the narrative and connect with the emotions being conveyed.

One area for improvement is the use of more descriptive language to further enhance the emotional impact of the writing.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from the author's personal experience and observations. The author effectively uses anecdotes and examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and persuasive. However, the writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as a more logical structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the author's ability to connect their personal experience to the broader issue of censorship. The quote from Katherine Paterson serves as a powerful rhetorical device, emphasizing the importance of protecting children from explicit content. The author also provides specific examples of how certain books, magazines, and movies can be detrimental to children, such as the prevalence of violence and teen pregnancy in popular media.

However, the essay could benefit from more critical thinking and analysis. The author's arguments are often based on assumptions and generalizations, rather than concrete evidence. For instance, the claim that children are more likely to think violence is okay because they read about it in books and magazines is not supported by empirical evidence. Additionally, the author's assertion that the rise in drug use and teen pregnancy is solely due to exposure to these topics in media is oversimplified and lacks nuance.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level writing. Many of the sentences are simplistic and lack variety, making the text feel repetitive and monotonous. The author could also benefit from more precise language and vocabulary, as well as more effective transitions between paragraphs.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of protecting children from explicit content to making a broader argument about the limitations of libraries.

The inclusion of phrases such as ""we stayed patient"" and ""we decided to go up and ask"" does not add much depth to the narrative. The writer could have explored the emotions and thoughts they experienced during the waiting period in more detail.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. The writer mentions that the waiting room was ""boring,"" but this is a very generic description. The writer could have used more descriptive language to convey the atmosphere and emotions they felt during this time.

One notable aspect of the essay is the writer's ability to identify a moment when they lost their patience, which is a crucial aspect of the concept of patience. However, this moment is not fully explored, and the writer does not provide much insight into what led to their loss of patience.

Overall, the essay provides a good starting point, but it requires more development and refinement to effectively explore the concept of patience.

The essay provides a heartwarming story about the development of a friendship between two individuals, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1, who bonded over their shared experience in a play. The narrative effectively conveys the importance of laughter in bringing people together and creating lasting relationships.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to incorporate specific details and anecdotes that illustrate the growth of the friendship. The author's use of descriptive language, such as ""they became vary close friends vary fast"" and ""they enjoyed the the good times that they had together,"" effectively conveys the intensity and depth of their connection. Additionally, the inclusion of specific events, such as the play's performances and the characters' interactions, adds a sense of authenticity to the narrative.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. The writing often relies on simplistic sentence structures and colloquial expressions, such as ""they stared to"" and ""they didn't tell a whole lot of people."" Furthermore, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the author could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas.

The essay also struggles with clarity and concision. Some sentences are wordy and meandering, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. For example, the sentence ""they both knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age"" could be condensed into a more concise and logical explanation.

Despite these limitations, the essay effectively conveys the theme of the importance of laughter and friendship. The author's passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter are evident throughout the narrative, and the story is engaging and relatable.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph, providing a sense of resolution and reinforcing the theme of overcoming obstacles. The inclusion of the hibiscus, a symbol of hope and renewal, serves as a powerful motivator for Saeng to take the test again. The author skillfully weaves this element into the narrative, creating a sense of continuity and cohesion. For instance, the mention of the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding in the spring creates a vivid image of a new beginning, underscoring Saeng's determination to move forward.

Moreover, the author's use of language is simple yet effective in conveying the message of perseverance. The phrase ""never give up"" is a clear and relatable takeaway, emphasizing the importance of finding motivation in everyday things. The author's writing style is accessible and engaging, making the story relatable to middle school readers. However, there are moments where the writing could be more precise and nuanced. For example, the phrase ""helps put the reader at ease"" could be rephrased to provide more depth and analysis.

The writer's primary concern is the removal of offensive materials from libraries, which is a valid point. However, their argument is marred by several issues, including a lack of clarity, grammatical errors, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. The writer's tone is also overly emotional and accusatory, which detracts from the persuasiveness of their argument.

One of the main problems with the essay is the writer's inability to articulate a clear and concise thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of respecting people's privacy to advocating for the removal of all offensive materials from libraries. A more focused thesis statement would have helped to guide the reader through the essay and provided a clearer direction for the writer's argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of rhetorical questions and emotional appeals does not effectively engage the reader or provide a compelling argument. For example, the writer asks, ""Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways?"" and ""Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school?"" These questions do not contribute to a nuanced discussion of the issue and instead come across as confrontational.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention a personal experience with a movie that had nudity and foul language, they do not provide any broader context or analysis of the issue. A more effective approach would be to provide specific examples and data to support their argument, such as statistics on the impact of exposure to violent or explicit content on children.

Additionally, the writer's tone is often condescending and judgmental, with phrases such as ""racist people"" and ""vulgar sayings."" This tone is off-putting and undermines the writer's credibility. A more objective and respectful tone would be more effective in persuading the reader.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing books to movies to magazines, without providing a clear connection between the different topics.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid concerns about the potential impact of offensive materials on children, their argument is marred by several issues, including a lack of clarity, grammatical errors, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

The author of the memoir effectively creates a positive mood by utilizing vivid descriptions of the author's childhood and family experiences. The use of sensory details, such as the ""warmth"" of the kitchen and the ""innocence of childhood,"" effectively evokes a sense of comfort and happiness in the reader. The author's portrayal of the community's unity and solidarity in the face of racism also contributes to the overall positive mood. However, the writing could benefit from more nuanced and varied sentence structures, as the essay relies heavily on simple sentences. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, as the connections between ideas are not always explicitly stated.

Furthermore, the author could benefit from more precise vocabulary and descriptive language. For example, instead of using the phrase ""the great impact,"" the author could use more specific language to describe the influence of the parents on Narciso's life. The use of metaphors and similes could also add depth and complexity to the writing.

Overall, the author demonstrates a clear understanding of how to create a positive mood through descriptive language and storytelling. With further refinement in sentence structure, vocabulary, and transitions, the writing could be even more effective in conveying the author's message.

The writer effectively uses personal opinions and observations to support their position, making the essay more engaging and persuasive. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and a lack of concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify potential counterarguments to censorship, such as the importance of free speech and the potential consequences of censorship on human knowledge. However, these points are not fully developed and could be strengthened with more detailed explanations and examples.

The writer also raises valid concerns about the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of knowledge and the potential for minor issues to escalate into more serious problems.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt by identifying the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The student provides specific quotes from the text to support their answer, which shows that they have carefully read and analyzed the excerpt.

However, the student's writing could benefit from improvement in several areas. Firstly, the introduction is quite general and lacks a clear thesis statement. The student jumps straight into discussing the obstacles without providing a clear direction for the essay. A more effective introduction would have set the stage for the rest of the essay and provided a clear argument.

Additionally, the student's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the mooring mast to the stress it would put on the building, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. A more cohesive structure would have helped to improve the flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the quotes provided. While the student provides quotes to support their answer, they do not fully explain the implications of these quotes or how they relate to the broader issue of the dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The writing is largely composed of simple sentences, which can make the text feel a bit flat at times. Incorporating more complex sentence structures and descriptive language would enhance the overall writing quality.

Overall, the essay provides a clear and compelling exploration of the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotional state. With further refinement and attention to sentence-level craft, the writing could be even more effective in conveying the author's message.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument against the benefits of computers on society. They effectively use personal anecdotes and statistics to support their claims, such as the example of the girl who committed suicide due to cyberbullying. The writer also uses persuasive language, such as rhetorical questions (""What if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog?"") and metaphors (""Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in their while at least attempting to be an extreme will turn you @CAPS7 and @CAPS7"").

However, the writer's argument is not without its flaws. At times, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (""@CAPS4 absolutely necessary""). Additionally, the writer relies heavily on abbreviations and acronyms, which can make the text difficult to read and understand. Furthermore, the writer's tone can come across as overly dramatic and sensationalized, particularly in the conclusion.

Despite these issues, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and presents a well-organized argument. They also effectively use rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""@CAPS4"") and allusion (""like trying to make bread without flour""), to emphasize their points.

To improve their writing, the writer should focus on refining their grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. They should also strive to present a more balanced argument, acknowledging potential benefits of computers on society, rather than solely focusing on the negative effects.

The student's essay provides a relatable and engaging story about their personal experience with laughter and its impact on their relationships. The narrative is well-structured, and the student effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the incident. However, the essay lacks cohesion and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a meandering tone. The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use humor and self-deprecation to convey their emotions and thoughts. The anecdote about their football injury is amusing, and the student's willingness to poke fun at themselves adds to the essay's lighthearted tone. However, the student could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language to convey their emotions and ideas.

The student's use of first-person narration is effective in creating a sense of intimacy and immediacy, but it also leads to some awkward phrasing and sentence structure. For example, the sentence ""Iv been playing football for about @NUM1 years now and iv never been hurt, except one pracitce"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

The writer's argument against censorship in libraries is well-structured and supported by a relevant quote from Katherine Paterson. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and observations to make their point, although some sentences could be rephrased for clarity and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the existence of offensive materials in libraries and the potential for disagreement among individuals. However, the writer could have delved deeper into the implications of censorship and the potential consequences of removing all potentially offensive materials from libraries. For instance, the writer could have explored the impact on intellectual freedom, the role of libraries as community hubs, and the importance of exposing students to diverse perspectives.

The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of personal choice and the responsibility that comes with it. By suggesting that individuals should be aware of the potential for encountering offensive materials in libraries, the writer encourages readers to think critically about their own values and boundaries.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer relies heavily on simplistic statements, such as ""A library can not please everyone"" and ""there will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines."" These statements lack depth and fail to engage with the complexities of the issue.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of abbreviations (e.g., ""ohter,"" ""disterbances"") and colloquial expressions (e.g., ""it @MONTH1"") detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

In conclusion, while the writer makes some valid points about the importance of personal choice and intellectual freedom, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated arguments, clearer writing, and a more nuanced exploration of the complexities of censorship in libraries.

The essay provides a unique and engaging story about patience, although it appears to be a jumbled and disjointed narrative. The writer attempts to convey the concept of patience through the experience of waiting in line for a long time, but the story is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and a lack of coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to illustrate the concept of patience through a relatable scenario. The writer effectively conveys the frustration and boredom that can come with waiting, as well as the sense of accomplishment when the desired outcome is finally achieved. However, the writing style is not polished, and the use of abbreviations and slang (e.g., ""@CAPS1"") detracts from the overall clarity and readability of the essay.

The writer also struggles with organization and coherence, as the narrative jumps abruptly from describing the cars to the line and the waiting experience. This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought and understand the context of the story.

In terms of vocabulary and sentence structure, the writer demonstrates a limited range of vocabulary and sentence complexity. The use of simple sentences and basic vocabulary (e.g., ""I was off,"" ""I exclaimed"") detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

Despite these limitations, the essay does demonstrate an understanding of the concept of patience and its importance. The writer effectively conveys the emotional highs and lows of waiting and the sense of accomplishment that comes with perseverance.

The essay provided raises several concerns regarding the removal of books from library shelves due to their content. However, the writer's arguments lack depth and clarity, relying heavily on simplistic and unconvincing statements. The writer's use of grammatical errors and lack of coherent sentence structure further detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the writer's failure to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claims. The writer states that ""little likd read the books then they will probley be tought rong from right,"" but fails to explain what specific books or content they are referring to. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to assess the writer's argument.

Furthermore, the writer's assertion that ""if the books had vilance then they will thinck tkat is right to"" is unclear and lacks logical coherence. The writer seems to be suggesting that books with violent content should be removed from shelves, but fails to explain why this is the case. This lack of explanation undermines the writer's credibility and makes their argument seem arbitrary.

In addition, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, including misspellings, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. These errors detract from the writer's ability to effectively communicate their ideas and make their argument more difficult to follow.

The author effectively conveys a sense of gratitude in the memoir, primarily through their description of the neighborhood and the sense of community that pervades it. The author highlights the diversity of the neighborhood, mentioning the presence of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, which creates a rich cultural tapestry.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image of the changing seasons, which serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's growth and determination.

The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to take the test again in the spring suggests that she has learned from her past experiences and is ready to face the challenge once more. This conclusion also implies that the story is not a one-time event, but rather a recurring cycle of trials and triumphs.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the student's argument is largely based on a simplistic and dismissive attitude towards offensive content, failing to provide a nuanced and well-supported stance.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the lack of concrete evidence and logical reasoning. The student relies heavily on personal anecdotes and general statements, such as ""many people complain about small things like that"" and ""many people have different opinions about different kinds of things."" These statements do not provide any concrete evidence to support the student's claim that censorship is not necessary. Furthermore, the student's assertion that ""you cannot find a book without at least one bad word in it"" is an oversimplification and does not account for the varying levels of maturity and sensitivity among readers.

The student also fails to consider the potential impact of censorship on readers who may be exposed to sensitive or disturbing content. While it is true that readers have the right to choose what they read, it is also important to acknowledge that some materials may be too mature or disturbing for certain individuals. The student's suggestion that readers should simply ""get over"" the fact that some materials contain offensive content is not a viable solution, as it disregards the potential harm that such content can cause.

In terms of organization and writing style, the essay is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks depth and complexity. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks transitions between paragraphs, making it feel disjointed and lacking in cohesion.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, advocating for categorization of books by age instead of removal. The essay effectively utilizes personal anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios to support the writer's position, making it relatable and engaging for the reader.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple perspectives, acknowledging the concerns of parents while also considering the needs of students and researchers. The writer's suggestion of creating separate sections for different age groups is a practical solution that would allow individuals to find the content they are looking for. This approach also promotes a more inclusive and accessible library environment.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential drawbacks of censorship. For instance, the writer could have explored the potential impact on intellectual freedom, the role of parents in making informed decisions about their children's reading materials, and the potential consequences of restricting access to certain books.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more concrete examples of books that might be considered ""offensive"" and how categorization by age would address these concerns. This would have strengthened the argument and made it more convincing.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is clear and concise, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the sentence ""It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection"" should be revised to ""It would make things easier and faster to find the book of your selection.""

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a well-structured argument. With further refinement and attention to detail, it has the potential to be an even stronger piece of writing.

The writer presents a well-structured and thought-provoking essay on the topic of censorship in libraries. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument, making the essay more relatable and engaging. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as the quote from Katherine Paterson, adds depth and context to the discussion.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the varying opinions on what is considered offensive. The writer recognizes that different people have different perspectives on what is acceptable and that removing books, magazines, and movies from libraries may not be the solution. This nuanced approach demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the issue.

However, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete evidence and examples to support their claims. While the writer mentions The Catcher in the Rye as an example of a book that may be considered offensive, they do not provide further context or analysis of the book's themes or content. Additionally, the writer's argument that libraries should not remove items from shelves but rather provide age restrictions or parental guidance could be further developed.

Furthermore, the writer's tone sometimes veers between persuasive and cautionary, which can make the essay feel somewhat inconsistent. While the writer's final statement, ""I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to'read at their own risk,'"" effectively conveys a clear message, it feels somewhat abrupt and could be supported by more evidence and analysis.

However, the connection between the mood of perseverance and the author's personal experience could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence.

The author's use of descriptive language, such as ""stress"" to describe the family's situation, is a good attempt to convey the emotional tone of the memoir. However, the transition between the description of the family's financial struggles and their ultimate success could be smoother. Furthermore, the author could benefit from providing more context about the significance of perseverance in the memoir, such as how it relates to the author's personal growth or the lessons learned from the experience.

The essay provides a personal anecdote about the importance of laughter during a difficult time. The writer shares a heart-wrenching story about their brother's accident and the emotional rollercoaster that followed. The narrative is engaging, and the writer's use of descriptive language effectively conveys the gravity of the situation.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance the seriousness of the accident with the lighter moments of humor and laughter. The writer skillfully weaves in instances of levity, such as the skid steer incident, to illustrate the importance of laughter in coping with adversity. However, the transitions between these lighter moments and the more somber parts of the story could be smoother.

The writer also demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, as they explicitly state the benefits of laughter in the context of the story. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and reflection on the role of laughter in the narrative. The writer's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt, and the final sentence, while well-intentioned, feels like a reiteration of the prompt rather than a thoughtful reflection on the significance of laughter.

Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For example, the use of all-caps for emphasis (""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2"") is not necessary and can come across as immature.

Additionally, the transition between sentences could be smoother, as some of the paragraphs feel disconnected from each other.

Furthermore, the author could have explored the theme of family more deeply, discussing how it has impacted Narciso's life and relationships. The essay touches on the idea of family as a source of comfort and support, but it would be beneficial to provide more context and analysis to make the theme more substantial.

The student's essay attempts to address the concept of patience by sharing a personal experience, but it lacks coherence and organization. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, run-on sentences, and a lack of clarity. The student's use of language is simplistic, and the essay fails to demonstrate a deep understanding of the concept of patience.

The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of logical flow. The student jumps between different ideas, such as describing the journey to the location, the traffic jam, and the waiting period, without connecting them to the concept of patience. The student's attempt to illustrate patience through the waiting period is also unsuccessful, as the example provided is more about the waiting experience rather than demonstrating patience.

The student's writing also lacks descriptive language and sensory details, making it difficult to visualize the scene. The use of phrases such as ""we where going"" and ""we t"" is also grammatically incorrect and detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to create a powerful connection between Saeng's personal growth and the natural world. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of renewal and perseverance that are woven throughout the narrative.

The author's use of the hibiscus, a plant that blooms in the spring, serves as a potent symbol of new beginnings.

One notable aspect of the essay is the writer's attempt to provide specific examples from the text to support their conclusion. For instance, the writer mentions a specific page number (@NUM1) where the cyclist had to go down a hill and find a factory for juice. This demonstrates an understanding of the text and shows that the writer is trying to provide evidence to support their claim.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about the author's experience with a unique aspect of their new high school, specifically the dueling club. The author effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the scene, drawing the reader into the story. For instance, the phrase ""the sea of tables in the cafeteria"" effectively conveys the author's initial confusion and surprise. The use of dialogue-free narrative also adds to the sense of realism and immediacy.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The story jumps abruptly from the author's initial encounter with the dueling club to their decision to join and eventually become friends with one of the members. A clearer transition between these sections would improve the flow of the essay. Additionally, the author could have provided more analysis or reflection on the significance of the dueling club in their life, rather than simply stating that it led to the formation of new friendships.

Furthermore, the essay relies heavily on the author's personal anecdotes and opinions, which, while engaging, do not provide a nuanced exploration of the topic. The author could have delved deeper into the cultural or social significance of dueling in the context of high school life, exploring how it relates to relationships, stress relief, or other relevant themes.

In terms of grammar, punctuation, and mechanics, the essay is generally well-written, with some minor errors in capitalization and punctuation. However, there are instances where the author's use of @CAPS and @PERSON1/@CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 could be clarified or avoided to improve clarity.

This conclusion is supported by the author's use of imagery and symbolism throughout the story. The comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus flower is a powerful metaphor that highlights the themes of adaptation and perseverance.

The author skillfully weaves together the details of Saeng's life, including her move to a new location and her struggles to adjust, with the image of the hibiscus flower, which has also undergone a transformation from a wild, untamed state to a cultivated one.

The writer's use of first-person narration and vivid details, such as the time spent waiting and the emotions experienced, helps to engage the reader.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of patience to sharing a personal story, and the connections between the two ideas could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, the writer could have provided more analysis and reflection on what they learned from the experience, rather than simply stating that it was a ""rewardance"" to their patience.

Furthermore, the writer could have used more precise language and varied sentence structures to improve the overall flow and clarity of the essay. For example, the sentence ""I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair"" could be rephrased for better grammar and punctuation.

Despite these areas for improvement, the essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience and its significance. The writer's personal experience and emotions add a relatable touch, making the essay more engaging and effective in conveying the importance of patience.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence. The writer mentions three reasons why the setting is challenging for the cyclist: distance, water, and heat. However, the essay fails to provide specific examples from the text to substantiate these claims. For instance, the writer states that the heat causes the cyclist to grow tired, but it would be helpful to include a direct quote or paraphrase from the essay to support this claim.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simplistic and lacks cohesion. The transition between ideas is abrupt, and the sentence structure is often simple. For example, the sentence ""As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat"" is a run-on sentence that could be broken up for better clarity.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on providing more specific examples from the text to support their claims. They should also work on developing a more sophisticated writing style, using varied sentence structures and transitions to connect their ideas.

The use of sensory details, such as the ""beating sun,"" ""pines,"" and ""rushing rivers,"" creates a dynamic and immersive atmosphere that immerses the reader in the scene. The description of the ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and bad-sounding corral effectively conveys the cyclist's surroundings as neglected and decaying, contributing to his growing despair.

The student's essay raises an interesting perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, highlighting the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of removing materials deemed disturbing or offensive. The student's argument that people should be allowed to make their own choices about what they read or listen to is a valid point, as it emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and autonomy.

However, the student's argument is not entirely convincing, as they fail to provide concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their stance. The essay relies heavily on personal opinions and emotions, rather than presenting a well-reasoned argument. For instance, the student states that ""people should not complain"" without explaining why this is the case. Additionally, the student's assertion that ""what is in these stores only makes us stronger"" is a vague and unsubstantiated claim that lacks concrete evidence to support it.

Furthermore, the student's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of clarity. The essay is often difficult to follow, and the student's use of sentence structure and vocabulary is limited. For example, the sentence ""I personally, in my own opinion think that would not be fair"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

In terms of addressing the prompt, the student does not provide a clear and persuasive argument in favor of not removing materials from libraries. While they acknowledge the importance of individual freedom, their argument is not well-supported and lacks concrete evidence to back it up.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, citing the importance of individual freedom and the difficulty in determining what is and isn't acceptable to different people. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and examples to support their stance, such as the example of movie ratings and categorizing materials by maturity level. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on simplistic and general statements. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the need for individual freedom. The writer recognizes that people have different standards of what is acceptable and that it's impossible to please everyone. However, this recognition is not followed through with a more detailed exploration of the issue.

The writer also struggles with sentence-level writing, with many sentences being short and lacking clarity. The use of abbreviations (e.g. @CAPS1) detracts from the overall quality of the writing. Furthermore, the writer's tone is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay.

To strengthen the essay, the writer could benefit from providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims.

The essay presents a simplistic and somewhat naive perspective on censorship in libraries. The writer seems to misunderstand the concept of censorship, equating it with personal preference rather than a legitimate concern for the well-being and safety of others. The writer's argument that individuals should simply ""not look at"" or ""not listen to"" content that offends them is not a viable solution, as it ignores the potential harm that such content can cause to vulnerable individuals.

The writer's assertion that ""a person might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes"" is a weak attempt to justify the presence of diverse content in libraries. This argument fails to acknowledge the importance of exposing students to different perspectives and ideas, which is a fundamental aspect of education.

Furthermore, the writer's suggestion that libraries should ""stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff"" is not only impractical but also dismissive of the role that libraries play in promoting critical thinking and intellectual freedom. Libraries are not meant to be a platform for personal preference, but rather a space for exploration, discovery, and growth.

The writer's writing style is also marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a general lack of organization. The text is riddled with abbreviations, misspellings, and run-on sentences, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, the writer's essay fails to provide a convincing argument in favor of maintaining diverse content in libraries.

The writer presents a well-structured and thought-provoking essay on the topic of censorship in libraries. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of freedom of expression and the need to respect diverse opinions.

The writer's argument is centered around the idea that censorship can be subjective and that what one person finds offensive, another might not. They provide personal anecdotes about reading books that their parents wouldn't choose for their children, highlighting the value of exposure to different perspectives. The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of separating explicit content from children's materials and allowing adults to make informed decisions about what they read.

The writer's discussion of music and movies is also noteworthy, as they acknowledge that different people have varying tastes and that censorship can lead to a lack of diversity in library collections. The example of the Bible being a potentially offending book is a good point, as it highlights the complexity of cultural and personal differences.

However, the writer's argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for clarity and coherence. For instance, the sentence ""If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Simple as that."" feels a bit abrupt and could be rephrased for better flow.

The writer of this essay has made an effort to present a balanced view on the effects of computers on society, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence in its argumentation. The writer relies heavily on personal anecdotes and examples, which, although relatable, do not provide substantial evidence to support the claim that computers are beneficial for people.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear organization and structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to providing examples, without a clear logical flow. This makes it challenging for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought. Furthermore, the writer fails to address the counterarguments presented in the prompt, which would have strengthened the essay.

Additionally, the writer's use of language and grammar is not always accurate. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life"" should be rephrased to ""Many people think email is a waste of time, but it can actually help you in your everyday life.""

Despite these issues, the writer does provide some valid points about the benefits of computers. The example of using Google Maps to find directions and access information is a great illustration of how computers can aid in everyday life. The writer also highlights the importance of computers in education, citing the use of email and online resources to complete assignments.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on providing more concrete evidence and examples to support their claims.

For instance, the writer states, ""the sun was beginning to beat down on the cyclist,"" which effectively conveys the intense heat of the desert sun. This description not only sets the scene but also emphasizes the cyclist's struggle to cope with the extreme conditions.

The writer also effectively uses sensory details to describe the cyclist's experience.

The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and accessible to the reader.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify specific instances where they felt uncomfortable or disturbed by certain media content. The example about the talk radio show and the protest video at the school assembly effectively illustrate the potential impact of uncensored information on individuals and communities.

The writer's argument that certain materials should be censored due to their potential to cause offense or disturb others is a common concern, but it is not fully developed. The writer could explore the concept of free speech and the importance of exposing people to diverse perspectives, even if they are uncomfortable or challenging. Additionally, the writer could consider alternative solutions, such as providing trigger warnings or age-based access controls, rather than advocating for outright censorship.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks clarity. Sentences are often short and lack cohesion, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The use of phrases such as ""I find that"" and ""I think that"" can also come across as overly simplistic and lacking in conviction.

The student provides a general statement that the mood is ""upbeat & happy"" without providing concrete evidence from the text to support this claim. The sentence ""This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir"" is also vague and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the text.

To support their claim, the student could have analyzed specific passages or quotes from the memoir that illustrate the author's tone and mood. For example, they could have discussed how the author's gratitude towards their parents and the cultural significance of Cuban music contribute to the overall mood of the memoir.

Additionally, the student could have demonstrated a better understanding of literary devices and techniques used to create mood, such as imagery, symbolism, or foreshadowing. By incorporating these elements, the student's analysis would be more nuanced and convincing.

Overall, the essay requires more attention to detail and a deeper analysis of the text to effectively describe the mood created by the author.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument on the benefits of computers in society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the text more relatable and engaging. One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple perspectives, acknowledging the opposing viewpoint and providing a balanced argument. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved.

The writer's use of grammar, spelling, and punctuation is generally good, but there are instances of errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent capitalization. For example, ""Some people say that computers are a negitive contributor to society"" should be ""Some people say that computers are a negative contributor to society."" Additionally, the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and more precise vocabulary.

The writer's organization and transitions between paragraphs could be improved. At times, the text feels disjointed, and it is not always clear how the ideas are connected. For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing hand-eye coordination to discussing the benefits of computers in medical settings.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of their arguments. While they provide some good examples, they often rely on simplistic statements, such as ""computers give us hand-eye coordination."" A more detailed explanation of how computers contribute to hand-eye coordination, such as through typing and gaming, would strengthen their argument.

Despite these areas for improvement, the writer demonstrates a clear passion for their topic and a willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints. With further refinement and attention to detail, their writing could be even more effective in persuading readers.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and determination. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of resilience and adaptation that are present throughout the narrative. 

One of the primary reasons for this conclusion is the symbolic significance of the spring season. The author skillfully uses the imagery of the snow melting and the geese returning to convey a sense of renewal and new beginnings. This serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own growth and development, as she is able to adapt to her new home and look forward to a brighter future. The mention of the hibiscus, which is a plant that blooms in the spring, further emphasizes this idea, as it represents the blossoming of Saeng's potential and her ability to thrive in her new environment.

Furthermore, the author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to herself to retake the test in the spring suggests that she is determined to overcome her struggles and achieve her goals. This determination is a testament to her character and serves as a powerful motivator for the reader. The fact that Saeng is willing to wait until the spring to retake the test also implies that she is willing to be patient and persistent in the face of adversity.

The conclusion also highlights Saeng's relationship with her mother, as she is motivated to succeed in order to make her mother proud. This adds a layer of emotional depth to the story, as it suggests that Saeng's actions are driven by a desire to please and honor her mother. The author effectively uses this dynamic to create a sense of tension and conflict, which is resolved in the conclusion.

Overall, the author's conclusion is a masterful stroke, as it ties together the various threads of the narrative and provides a sense of closure and resolution. The use of symbolism, imagery, and character development all contribute to a powerful and satisfying conclusion that leaves the reader with a lasting impression.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise argument on the benefits of computers in society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. The use of transitional phrases, such as ""Please read on"" and ""Lastly,"" helps to guide the reader through the essay and makes it easier to follow.

However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete data to back up their claims. For instance, the statement ""computers and technology benefit us in many ways"" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific examples. Additionally, the writer fails to address the counterargument presented in the prompt, which is that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

The writing also contains several grammatical errors, such as ""I have heerd"" instead of ""I have heard,"" ""me benef it"" instead of ""benefit us,"" and ""you can hook up"" instead of ""you can connect."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is somewhat informal and lacks polish. The use of abbreviations, such as ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@ORGANIZATION2,"" is not suitable for a formal letter to the editor. The writer also fails to proofread their work, as evidenced by the numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.

Overall, while the essay provides a clear argument, it lacks depth, supporting evidence, and polish. With further refinement and attention to detail, the writer has the potential to produce a stronger essay.

The author effectively uses the final paragraph to conclude the story by conveying Saeng's emotional state and her desire to move forward. The phrase ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" serves as a symbol of renewal and new beginnings, which is reinforced by Saeng's vow to take the test again. This decision is not solely driven by a desire to please her mom, but also by her own personal growth and self-improvement. The author skillfully highlights Saeng's inner conflict by mentioning that she ""couldn't do that"" and her attachment to the flower, which holds memories for her. However, the author's interpretation that Saeng can have both her old and new life is a more nuanced and thoughtful conclusion, suggesting that Saeng is capable of growth and self-awareness.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about a time when the student was patient. The narrative effectively conveys the concept of patience and its significance in the student's life. The use of specific details, such as the date and the amount of time waiting, helps to illustrate the student's experience and makes the story more believable.

However, the essay could benefit from some improvement in terms of organization and coherence. The story jumps abruptly from discussing the student's impatience to their patience, and some sentences are worded awkwardly. For instance, the phrase ""I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced language and varied sentence structures. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the writing seem a bit flat. Incorporating more complex sentence structures and descriptive language can enhance the overall flow and engagement of the essay.

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation, with several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of apostrophes. For example, ""I said, “@CAPS2.”"" should be ""I said, '@CAPS2.'"".

Despite these areas for improvement, the essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt and convey a meaningful message about patience. With some revisions to address the issues mentioned above, the student's writing could become more polished and effective.

This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance, growth, and the cyclical nature of life. The author highlights Saeng's determination to retake the test, which symbolizes her refusal to give up despite past failures. The mention of spring, snows melting, and geese returning serves as a metaphor for the renewal and rejuvenation that comes with the changing of the seasons, emphasizing the idea that Saeng is ready to start anew.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the ""hibiscus is budding,"" creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, underscoring the idea that Saeng is not only determined but also hopeful for a brighter future. The phrase ""then I will take that test again"" serves as a promise to herself, demonstrating Saeng's growth and maturity. This conclusion also leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation, wondering what will happen next and whether Saeng will succeed in her endeavor.

Furthermore, the author's decision to conclude the story in the spring, a season often associated with new beginnings, suggests that the author is emphasizing the idea that growth and learning are ongoing processes. Saeng's vow to retake the test is not a one-time event, but rather a continuous effort to improve and learn.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The student has identified two specific complications, namely the stress on the building's frame due to a massive dirigible tied to the building by a cable tether, and the issue of storage for the winches and control machinery. However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of these complications. For instance, the student could have explained how the architects and builders overcame these obstacles, or provided more details about the modifications made to the framework. Additionally, the student could have used more precise language and sentence structures to convey their ideas.

The student has also failed to provide specific examples or evidence from the excerpt to support their claims.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the negative effects of excessive computer use on individuals, particularly in the context of family relationships and academic performance. The student effectively uses personal anecdotes, such as the example of their sister ignoring their parents while on the computer, to support their claims. This makes the argument more engaging and accessible to the reader.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and evidence-based reasoning. The student relies heavily on general statements and percentages without providing concrete data or expert opinions to support their claims. For instance, the statement that ""@PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything"" is not backed by any credible sources, and the percentage itself is not specified.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions and organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the negative effects of computer use on family relationships to academic performance, and the writing could be more logically connected.

The author provides specific examples from the text to support their argument, such as the quote from Narciso's neighborhood where people from different cultures come together in solidarity and friendship. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the author's intent and the ability to analyze the text.

The essay provided raises several concerns regarding the impact of computers on society, presenting a clear and relatable argument. However, the writing quality and coherence of the essay are significantly hindered by numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and lack of proper sentence structure. The text is marred by numerous instances of misspelled words, such as ""aegre"" instead of ""agree,"" ""tnachnolige"" instead of ""technology,"" and ""frchr"" instead of ""church."" These errors detract from the overall effectiveness of the essay and make it challenging to discern the writer's intended message.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear and logical flow, with sentences that seem to be randomly connected. The writer's arguments are not well-supported, and the use of transitional phrases is virtually non-existent. The writer's tone is also inconsistent, veering wildly between enthusiastic and dismissive language. For instance, the writer states that ""tnachnologe evans as we maech at,"" which is unclear and difficult to interpret.

Despite these significant flaws, the writer does raise some valid points about the potential benefits of technology, such as its ability to facilitate communication and access to information. However, these points are not effectively developed or supported, and the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to substantiate their claims.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is that children should be exposed to a wide range of materials, including those that may be considered offensive, in order to learn about the world and make informed decisions. The writer cites personal experiences and observations to support their claim, such as the importance of learning about different cultures and the dangers of peer pressure. However, the writer's arguments are often marred by grammatical errors, lack of clarity, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the writer's main points is that children should be taught to distinguish between right and wrong, and that they should be aware of the potential dangers of the world. While this is a valid concern, the writer's approach is often simplistic and fails to acknowledge the complexity of the issue. For example, the writer suggests that children should be taught to say no to peer pressure, but does not provide any guidance on how to do so effectively.

The writer also raises concerns about the impact of media on children, citing examples of media that promote negative behaviors and body image issues. However, the writer's critique of media is often superficial and fails to engage with the broader social and cultural context in which these issues arise.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often confrontational and accusatory, with phrases such as ""you should not teach your children off of things like that"" and ""that is not fair to readers."" This tone undermines the writer's credibility and makes it difficult to take their arguments seriously.

In terms of organization and structure, the essay is disorganized and lacks a clear thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from one topic to another, without providing a clear connection between the different paragraphs.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as a more logical structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use concrete examples to illustrate their points.

Furthermore, the writer uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks varied vocabulary, which is evident in phrases such as ""Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist"" and ""So now matter what we was having bad trouble any way."" The writer also fails to provide concrete examples that directly support their claims, instead relying on vague statements like ""he was drinking to much of his water"" and ""he started his ride the the roads were hilly and short.""

To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, using more complex sentence structures and varied vocabulary to convey their ideas. They should also provide specific examples that directly support their claims, such as describing the physical effects of the hot desert environment on the cyclist's physical condition or the impact of the bumpy roads on the cyclist's comfort.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of change, adaptation, and perseverance that are woven throughout the narrative. The author skillfully uses sensory details, such as the mention of spring, snows, geese, and hibiscus, to create a vivid image of a season of renewal and growth. This imagery serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's personal growth and determination to overcome her struggles.

The author's decision to set the conclusion in the spring, a time of renewal and new beginnings, is particularly effective in emphasizing Saeng's resolve to tackle her challenges head-on. The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of determination and commitment, underscoring Saeng's resolve to succeed. Furthermore, the phrase ""then I will take that test again"" serves as a clear statement of intent, highlighting Saeng's focus on her goal and her willingness to work towards it.

The author's conclusion is also notable for its subtlety and restraint. Rather than providing a dramatic or overly sentimental conclusion, the author allows the reader to infer Saeng's emotions and intentions from the text. This understated approach adds to the narrative's emotional impact, making the reader more invested in Saeng's journey.

Overall, the conclusion effectively ties together the narrative threads of the story, providing a sense of closure and resolution while also leaving the reader with a lasting impression of Saeng's resilience and determination.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and statistics to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and persuasive. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""computers impact humans in a harmful manner"") and emotional appeals (""a much happier and stronger individual""), adds to the persuasive power of the essay.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that computers lead to a lack of exercise, but fails to provide specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. Additionally, the writer's argument is not entirely original, as many of the points made have been discussed in previous essays.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of slang terms, such as ""@ORGANIZATION1"" and ""@CAPS1,"" detracts from the overall credibility of the essay. The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation, with several instances of incorrect verb tenses and missing articles.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the natural world, which is characterized by the return of geese and the budding of the hibiscus. The image of the hibiscus, a flower often associated with beauty and growth, reinforces the idea that Saeng is looking forward to a new beginning. The use of the word ""vowed"" also implies a sense of determination and commitment, suggesting that Saeng is resolute in her decision to retake the test.

The author's conclusion also highlights the significance of the natural world in Saeng's life.

The author effectively concludes the story with a hopeful tone by having Saeng make a confident vow to herself, which serves as a goal to look forward to. This decision is supported by the context of the story, where Saeng has had a rough day and is struggling to cope with her new surroundings. The author skillfully uses this moment to showcase Saeng's resilience and determination, as evident in her silent vow to take the test again when the snow melts and the geese return. This conclusion not only provides a sense of closure but also leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism.

Furthermore, the author cleverly weaves together the symbols of the geese and the hibiscus to create a connection to the spring season. The geese represent a new beginning, while the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's old home, highlighting the idea that even in a new environment, there is always a connection to one's past. This connection is skillfully made by the author, who uses the natural imagery of the geese and the hibiscus to create a sense of continuity and renewal.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the author's use of language and literary devices.

The student's essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The essay effectively conveys the idea that patience is about being understanding and tolerant, and that it can make waiting for something worthwhile. The student's personal anecdote about waiting for the art prize is engaging and relatable, and it effectively illustrates the value of patience.

However, the essay could benefit from some significant improvements in terms of writing quality. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks clarity. For example, the sentence ""I was dieing to see the winnig picture for art prize"" should be ""I was dying to see the winning picture for the art prize.""

The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, specifically highlighting the ways in which the setting affects the cyclist. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of organization, grammar, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of vivid descriptions to convey the narrator's emotions and reactions to the setting. For instance, the phrase ""I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump"" effectively conveys the narrator's frustration and desperation for water. Additionally, the use of sensory details, such as the description of the brackish water tasting like ""battery acid,"" helps to immerse the reader in the narrator's experience.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph where Saeng vows to take the test again when the spring arrives, and the hibiscus is in bloom, as a way to symbolize her own personal growth and renewal. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, perseverance, and the cyclical nature of life, which are central to the story.

The author's use of the hibiscus as a symbol of rebirth and renewal is particularly effective in conveying Saeng's emotional state. The fact that the hibiscus blooms in the spring, after a period of dormancy during the winter, serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own ability to start anew and try again after a setback.

Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""should've"" and ""never manifest"" is informal and detracts from the overall tone of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more precise and technical vocabulary. For example, instead of using the phrase ""the men who built the massive structure,"" the student could use more descriptive language, such as ""the architects and engineers responsible for designing the Empire State Building.""

The student demonstrates a good attempt to identify some of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence, with several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The student's writing could benefit from more precise language and organization.

Specifically, the student mentions that the builders needed a sufficient cable to support the Blimp, passengers, and any additional weight, which is a valid point. However, this idea is not fully developed or supported with evidence from the excerpt. The student also mentions the challenge of dealing with the power of the wind at high altitudes, but this point is not clearly connected to the main idea.

The student's use of sentence structure and vocabulary is also limited, with several instances of run-on sentences and simplistic language. For example, the sentence ""Another reason Is the Building @CAPS10 would Have to @CAPS4 UP"" is unclear and difficult to understand.

The writer's primary argument against censorship in libraries is centered around the idea that restricting access to certain materials can lead to children seeking alternative, potentially more explicit sources. The writer cites personal experience, stating that they and their friends would sneak into theaters to watch R-rated movies, and that this behavior would continue even if the movies were available in libraries. However, this argument is weakened by the writer's own admission that they would have lied to their parents about what they saw at the movies.

Moreover, the writer's suggestion that parents should have open discussions with their children about the content of the movie is a valid approach, but it does not address the issue of censorship itself. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claim that censorship is ineffective, instead relying on a quote from Katherine Paterson to make a point that is not directly relevant to the topic.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often informal and dismissive, using slang and colloquial expressions that detract from the persuasive power of their argument. The writer also fails to acknowledge potential counterarguments, such as the importance of protecting children from explicit content that may be harmful or disturbing.

In conclusion, while the writer raises some valid points about the potential consequences of censorship, their argument is ultimately undermined by their own biases and lack of concrete evidence. A more effective approach would be to present a balanced analysis of the issue, acknowledging both the potential benefits and drawbacks of censorship.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses specific examples to support their argument, such as the presence of rocks and snakes on the road, which highlights the importance of self-reliance for cyclists. However, the essay lacks depth and analysis, with the writer relying heavily on simplistic statements and generalizations. For instance, the phrase ""the features affect the cyclist in many ways"" is a broad statement that does not provide any concrete evidence to back it up. Additionally, the writer's tone is somewhat informal and lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed explanations of the features of the setting and how they impact the cyclist. For example, they could discuss how the terrain, weather, and road conditions affect the cyclist's safety and experience. The writer could also explore the importance of self-reliance in more depth, discussing how it enables cyclists to respond to unexpected situations and make informed decisions.

Overall, while the essay provides a good starting point, it requires more development and refinement to become a strong and effective piece of writing.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey the theme of resilience and the possibility of personal growth. This conclusion is supported by the events that have transpired in the story. Saeng's past experiences, particularly her failure to resist the temptation of the ""cestain flower,"" demonstrate her struggle to adapt to her new surroundings. However, her determination to overcome this challenge and take the test again in the future suggests that she is capable of change.

The author's use of imagery in the concluding paragraph also reinforces this idea. The mention of spring, geese, and the hibiscus flower creates a sense of renewal and hope, implying that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. The fact that she is willing to wait until the spring to take the test again underscores her patience and perseverance. Furthermore, the phrase ""I will take that test again"" serves as a declaration of her commitment to overcoming her past mistakes and adapting to her new environment.

The author's conclusion also highlights Saeng's desire to please her mother, as mentioned in the essay. This motivation adds a personal layer to Saeng's determination, suggesting that her actions are driven by a sense of responsibility and a need for validation. Overall, the concluding paragraph effectively ties together the themes of resilience, personal growth, and the possibility of change, providing a satisfying conclusion to the story.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to effectively convey Saeng's emotional state and her connection to her past. The author skillfully weaves together three significant themes: memories, promise, and life, to create a poignant conclusion.

The mention of memories is a crucial element in this paragraph, as it highlights Saeng's longing for her old life and country. The author supports this idea by stating that ""memories is one idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph"" and that Saeng ""brought the flower and planted so it can live once spring has come and she said the n she will retake the test."" This shows that Saeng is holding onto her memories and is determined to recreate a sense of life and normalcy in her current situation.

The promise is another significant theme in this paragraph, as Saeng makes a vow to herself to take the test again when spring arrives. The author effectively conveys this idea by stating that ""promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again."" This promise serves as a symbol of Saeng's resilience and determination, demonstrating that she is committed to moving forward and reclaiming her life.

The concept of life is also deeply connected to this paragraph, as Saeng plants the hibiscus, which represents a desire to start anew and live a life filled with beauty and hope. The author supports this idea by stating that ""life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted so it can live once spring has come and she said the n she will retake the test."" This shows that Saeng is taking small steps towards rebuilding her life and finding a sense of purpose.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the image of the snows melting and the geese returning, effectively evokes a sense of hope and renewal, which is reinforced by the budding hibiscus. This creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind, making the conclusion more impactful and memorable.

Overall, the author's conclusion is a masterful blend of themes, imagery, and symbolism, which effectively conveys Saeng's emotional state and her connection to her past. The use of specific details and examples from the story supports the author's ideas, making the",-1

Furthermore, the author's use of the phrase ""I will take that test again"" serves as a promise to herself and the reader, implying that Saeng is not giving up. This promise is reinforced by the fact that she makes this vow ""silently,"" indicating that she is making a personal commitment to herself, rather than seeking external validation. The author's conclusion effectively leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and anticipation, suggesting that Saeng's story is far from over.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The student identifies three main obstacles: the danger posed by dirigibles, the impact of nature, and the existing law. However, the student could have provided more specific details and evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, the student could have elaborated on the specific dangers posed by the hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles and how this affected the design of the mooring mast. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the law and its implications on the building's design.

The student's writing is clear and concise, but it lacks depth and analysis. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the student could have used more transitional phrases to connect their ideas. Furthermore, the student could have provided more concrete examples to illustrate the impact of the obstacles on the building's design and construction.

One area for improvement is the student's use of sentence structure and grammar. There are several instances of simple sentences that could be rephrased to improve clarity and flow. For example, the sentence ""However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that"" could be rephrased to ""However, one of the significant challenges the builders faced when designing the mast itself was that.""

The essay effectively attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The writer provides some relevant information from the memoir, such as the description of the author's Cuban background and the importance of family in the community. However, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of specific textual evidence to support the claims.

For instance, the writer states that the author's ""living enviornment"" should be spelled as ""environment"" and that the phrase ""selvs"" should be spelled as ""selves."" Additionally, the use of the phrase ""rough times"" is vague and could apply to many different contexts. The writer could have provided more specific examples from the memoir to illustrate the author's description of the community's struggles.

Furthermore, the writer's analysis of the author's definition of family is oversimplified and lacks nuance. The writer states that the author defines family as ""the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other,"" but this is not explicitly stated in the memoir.

The essay provides a clear and relatable scenario of a cyclist facing challenges in the wilderness. However, the essay lacks a clear and focused exploration of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer seems to focus more on the cyclist's physical state rather than the environmental factors that contribute to the situation.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of descriptive language and sensory details about the setting. The writer could have used more vivid descriptions of the landscape, climate, and weather conditions to create a richer and more immersive experience for the reader. For example, the writer could have described the scorching heat, the dryness of the air, or the steep terrain to help the reader visualize the cyclist's struggle.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from a more nuanced analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist's emotions and actions. The writer mentions that the cyclist is ""doubtful"" about completing the journey, but this feeling could be explored in more depth. How does the harsh environment contribute to the cyclist's doubt? What specific features of the setting exacerbate the cyclist's dehydration and dizziness?

Additionally, the writer could have used more effective transitions and connections between paragraphs to create a smoother flow of ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the cyclist's physical state to discussing the journey, without clear connections between the two ideas.

Overall, while the essay provides a clear and relatable scenario, it lacks a more in-depth exploration of the setting and its impact on the cyclist.

The author effectively uses sensory details to illustrate Saeng's emotional response to the flower, such as ""When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden it was like bringing a little piece of Vietnam home which made her feel better."" This sentence showcases the author's ability to use vivid imagery to convey Saeng's emotional state, demonstrating a strong understanding of the narrative's themes of hope and connection to one's heritage.

However, the author could improve the coherence and organization of the paragraph. The sentence structure is sometimes simplistic, and the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the sentence ""The over all inspiration and the memories the flower had for Saeng made her feel better about her new home and feel better about her new home and gave her a reson to start fresh with her driving test"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. A more effective approach would be to break down the ideas into separate sentences and use transitional phrases to connect them.

Additionally, the author could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the story's themes and symbolism. While the flower is an effective symbol of hope and connection to one's heritage, the author does not fully explore its significance in the context of Saeng's journey.

The comparison between the plant's struggles and Saeng's experiences serves as a powerful metaphor, underscoring her resolve to overcome the obstacles she has faced. For instance, the hibiscus plant is described as being in a ""cold"" pot, mirroring Saeng's emotional state after failing the driver's test and spending all her money on a plant from her old home. This parallelism reinforces the notion that Saeng is determined to find her footing in her new surroundings, just as the hibiscus plant is determined to thrive despite its challenging circumstances.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The writer's arguments are often based on general assumptions and stereotypes, such as the idea that people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time exercising or interacting with others. While these concerns are valid, they are not fully supported by evidence or logical reasoning. Furthermore, the writer's use of all capital letters and abbreviations, such as ""@ORGANIZATION1"" and ""facebook,"" detracts from the overall professionalism and clarity of the essay.

In terms of organization and structure, the essay could be improved by a clearer introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to making a general statement about people's behavior, and the conclusion feels somewhat tacked on. A more logical and cohesive structure would help to strengthen the writer's arguments and make the essay more convincing.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates some strengths in terms of engagement and persuasive techniques, it requires more attention to detail, nuance, and organization to elevate it to a higher level of writing quality.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion. For instance, the writer states, ""his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal,"" which highlights the physical toll of the ride on the cyclist. This sentence effectively conveys the impact of the setting on the cyclist's physical state.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal examples and relatable scenarios to support their claims, making the text more engaging and accessible to the reader. For instance, the writer uses the example of being able to see and speak to family members who live far away, which highlights the importance of technology in bridging geographical gaps. Additionally, the writer's use of rhetorical devices such as repetition (""having a computer is a huge benefit"") and metaphors (""having a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button"") adds to the persuasive tone of the essay.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For example, the writer states that computers ""teach hand-eye coordination,"" but fails to provide specific examples or explanations of how this is achieved. Furthermore, the writer's argument is not entirely convincing, as they acknowledge the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, but do not provide a comprehensive solution to this issue.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of grammatical errors, such as ""abels"" instead of ""allows,"" and ""creampie"" instead of ""cream pie,"" detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

The writer presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, effectively addressing both sides of the issue. The essay begins by acknowledging the importance of considering multiple perspectives, which sets a positive tone for the rest of the piece. The writer's personal anecdote about their cousin's influence and their own subsequent interests serves as a relatable example to support their point about the malleability of young minds.

However, the essay could benefit from more concrete evidence and logical connections between the writer's arguments. The writer's assertion that ""books have gotten out of hand"" and need to be censored is not supported by specific examples or data. Additionally, the writer's conclusion that ""if you censor one thing, censor them all"" is a simplistic and overly broad statement that does not effectively address the complexities of censorship.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can be seen as somewhat flippant and dismissive of the concerns surrounding censorship. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""not in my opinion"" and ""in the end,"" detract from the writer's credibility and make the essay feel less formal.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as allusions to the idea that ""if you censor one thing, you censor them all,"" is a good attempt to engage the reader, but it could be more effective if it were more explicitly stated and supported with evidence.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the influence of media on young minds to arguing for censorship. A clearer transition between these ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, stores, and media. The writer effectively conveys their concern for the potential impact of explicit content on children and adolescents. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation, relying heavily on personal anecdotes and simplistic solutions.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to engage the reader with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer also provides specific examples from their personal experiences, such as witnessing a child reading a magazine with explicit content in a store. These examples help to illustrate the writer's point and make the essay more relatable.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated analysis and evidence to support its claims. The writer's argument is largely based on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions, which may not be convincing to readers who may not share the same experiences or perspectives. Additionally, the essay could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the complexities of censorship and the potential consequences of restricting access to certain materials.

For instance, they mention that computers allow individuals to ""talk with people online and get information quickly than the library,"" which highlights the convenience and accessibility of digital resources. Additionally, the writer emphasizes the versatility of computers, noting that they can be used for relaxation, work, and leisure activities simultaneously.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and evidence-based arguments. The writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""The effects computers have on a person, are good effects"" and ""computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one."" To strengthen their argument, the writer could provide more specific examples or statistics to support their claims.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from improved organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly between ideas, and some sentences are worded unclearly. For example, the sentence ""But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer"" is difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively identifies the emotions experienced by the cyclist, including frustration, thirst, and confusion. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to substantiate the claim. The writer simply states that the features of the setting are making the cyclist frustrated without providing specific examples or details to support this assertion.

For instance, the writer mentions that the cyclist thought he was going the right way but was actually going in the opposite direction. This sentence is a good starting point, but it does not fully develop the idea of how the setting contributed to the cyclist's frustration. The writer could have explored this idea further by describing the cyclist's surroundings, the road conditions, or the cyclist's thoughts and feelings in that moment.

Additionally, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and its impact on the cyclist. For example, instead of simply stating that the cyclist was ""thirsty,"" the writer could have described the sensation of thirst, the physical sensations in the cyclist's mouth and throat, or the emotional response to feeling parched.

The essay lacks coherence and organization, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner. The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, with multiple errors throughout the essay.

One of the significant strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to convey their emotions and thoughts about being patient. The use of phrases such as ""I was patient one time"" and ""I had to be patient"" shows an understanding of the concept of patience. However, these ideas are not developed further, and the essay could benefit from more analysis and reflection.

The student also attempts to incorporate specific details, such as the gift they bought for their brother and the surprise they received from their mom. However, these details are not effectively integrated into the narrative, and the essay could benefit from more transitions and connections between ideas.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from describing the student's actions to the outcome, without clear connections between the two. The student also fails to provide a clear thesis statement or summary of their main point, making it difficult to understand the essay's purpose.

The author skillfully weaves together various elements from the story to support their argument, demonstrating a good understanding of the narrative.

One of the strengths of the conclusion is its focus on the flower's symbolism. The author correctly identifies the flower as a source of peace and confidence, which is reinforced by the fact that it blooms in the spring, a season often associated with renewal and new beginnings. The author also astutely notes that the flower's ability to bloom continuously serves as a powerful reminder to the main character not to give up. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the main character had a positive association with the flower, as it reminded her of her home in Vietnam.

The writer presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, highlighting the importance of freedom of expression and the diversity of individual tastes and preferences. The essay effectively uses personal anecdotes and real-life examples to illustrate the subjective nature of what is considered ""offensive"" or ""inappropriate"" content.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the need to balance individual freedom with community standards. The writer raises a valid point that not everyone will agree on what content is suitable for children, and that censorship can be subjective and potentially damaging. The example of the book with a nude picture that educates about breast cancer is a great illustration of this point.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. At times, the writer's tone comes across as somewhat simplistic and emotive, with phrases such as ""we all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin."" While this sentiment is well-intentioned, it could be more effectively conveyed through more precise and technical language.

The writer's primary goal is to persuade the reader to keep all materials available, but their approach is marred by grammatical errors, incoherent sentences, and a lack of concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary issues with the essay is its lack of organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the consequences of removing books to talking about the consequences of removing music, without providing a clear connection between the two topics. This disjointed structure makes it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is riddled with grammatical errors, including misspellings, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. For example, the sentence ""I mean realy it will start confliced"" is grammatically incorrect, and the sentence ""You can take this any way that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late"" is a jumbled mess of words.

Additionally, the writer's argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence, with statements such as ""I have seen what happens when you take a book off the shelf"" and ""I have seen what happens when u take music off the self."" While these statements may be based on personal experience, they do not provide a convincing argument for keeping all materials available.

In terms of supporting evidence, the writer does not provide any credible sources or data to back up their claims. They also fail to address potential counterarguments, such as the potential harm that certain materials may cause to individuals or society as a whole.

The writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""the author's mood is very happy, generous, and humble,"" without providing concrete evidence from the text to support these claims. For instance, the writer could have analyzed specific scenes, quotes, or events in the memoir that illustrate the author's happiness, generosity, and humility.

Moreover, the writer's writing style is simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of varied sentence structures. This makes the text feel somewhat flat and unengaging. Additionally, the writer's transitions between ideas could be smoother, as the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the author's happiness to her parents' generosity.

To strengthen the analysis, the writer could have delved deeper into the text, exploring specific moments that demonstrate the author's emotions and the author's parents' actions. They could have also varied their sentence structure and used more descriptive language to create a more immersive reading experience.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates a good effort, it requires more attention to detail, analysis, and writing craft to effectively convey the author's mood in the memoir.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the cyclist's situation, such as ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement"" and ""my dehydrated state."" However, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure, and the writer could benefit from providing more supporting evidence from the text to strengthen their argument.

The writer's analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist is limited, and they fail to provide a nuanced exploration of how the environment contributes to the cyclist's challenges. For example, the writer mentions that the cyclist is dehydrated, but does not fully explain how this affects his ability to navigate the terrain or make decisions. Additionally, the writer could have explored the psychological impact of the setting on the cyclist, such as how the snake and the desert environment contribute to his fear and anxiety.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is informal and lacks polish, with phrases such as ""You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes"" and ""tantalizing sips."" While this may be suitable for a casual conversation, it is not suitable for a formal essay. The writer could benefit from using more formal language and avoiding colloquial expressions.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good effort, but requires significant improvement in terms of organization, analysis, and writing style.

The essay provided does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of patience. The writer's attempt to convey the idea of patience is hindered by numerous grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and incoherent sentence structure. The writer seems to have mixed up words and phrases, resulting in sentences that are difficult to decipher.

The writer's use of language is simplistic and lacks depth, with a reliance on short, simplistic sentences that fail to convey a clear message.

Furthermore, the writer's narrative is disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, without providing a clear connection between the different events. This makes it challenging to understand the writer's intended message.

The writer's conclusion, which attempts to provide a final thought on patience, is also poorly constructed. The phrase ""And the best we to be pashint is to keep your self okupid for along  pereld"" is unclear and does not effectively convey the idea of patience.

The author effectively conveys a sense of nostalgia and warmth in the memoir, creating a sentimental mood that resonates with the reader. The statement ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" is a poignant example of this, as it highlights the significance of the house as a symbol of the author's happy memories with his family. The author's use of the word ""home"" also implies a sense of comfort and security, which is reinforced by the fact that the house is now the only memory he has of his parents after they have passed away. The author's reliance on this specific memory to describe his mood is a testament to the emotional impact of the house on his life.

However, the analysis could be strengthened by providing more specific details from the memoir to support the argument. For instance, the author could have elaborated on the specific ways in which the house was transformed into a home, or how it reflects the author's personal growth and development. Additionally, the transition between the past and present could be smoother, as the author jumps abruptly from describing the happy memories to the current state of missing his parents.

Furthermore, the writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The essay is heavy on simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times. Incorporating more complex sentence structures and descriptive language would enhance the overall impact of the writing.

The writer's primary argument is that computers have a predominantly positive effect on society, citing various examples of how they facilitate communication, research, and economic growth. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes, statistics, and expert opinions to support their claim. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance, relying heavily on simplistic and unsubstantiated statements. The writer also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall credibility of the argument.

One of the writer's strongest points is their use of specific examples, such as the president of the post office's statement about the importance of computers in modern communication. However, these examples are often taken out of context and lack concrete evidence to support the writer's claims. For instance, the writer states that ""@CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is,"" but fails to provide any further explanation or evidence to support this claim.

The writer also relies heavily on statistics, but these are often misinterpreted or misused. For example, the writer states that ""When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch,"" but fails to provide any further context or explanation of what this statistic actually means.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity. The use of abbreviations, acronyms, and slang (e.g. ""lam out sick"") detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay. Additionally, the writer's tone is often confrontational and argumentative, which can be off-putting to readers.

In conclusion, while the writer makes some valid points about the benefits of computers, their essay is ultimately marred by poor grammar, punctuation, and writing style. With further refinement and attention to detail, the writer could make a more compelling case for the benefits of computers.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging account of a personal experience with patience. The writer effectively conveys their excitement and anticipation for their birthday, and the reader can easily visualize the emotions and events that unfolded. The use of first-person narration and colloquial expressions, such as ""I couldn't wait"" and ""I give up,"" adds to the authenticity of the story.

However, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and varied sentence structures. The writer relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the text feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

The writer also struggles with transitions between ideas and connecting the dots between their experience and the concept of patience. The essay jumps abruptly from describing their excitement for their birthday to their brother's revelation, and then to their frustration. A more cohesive structure and smoother transitions would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the concept of patience. While they describe what it means to be patient, they don't delve deeper into the emotional or psychological aspects of patience. Exploring the emotional benefits of patience, such as reduced stress or increased self-control, would add depth to the essay.

Despite these areas for improvement, the writer demonstrates a clear and relatable writing style, and their enthusiasm for the topic shines through. With some refinement in sentence structure, transitions, and analysis, this essay has the potential to become an even stronger piece of writing.

The writer presents a well-structured and thought-provoking essay on the topic of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom of expression and the potential consequences of censorship.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the diversity of opinions on the matter, recognizing that people have different tastes and preferences when it comes to books. The writer's argument that books should be kept on shelves because they may help someone in some way is a compelling one, and the suggestion to categorize books by genre is a practical solution to the problem of people encountering books they find offensive.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. For example, the writer mentions that if every library removed books that some people found offensive, there would be nothing left, but this point could be developed further to explore the potential impact on intellectual freedom and the role of libraries as institutions of knowledge.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels a bit abrupt, and some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. For instance, the sentence ""If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldn't have put it out there for the world to see"" could be rephrased to ""If the publisher or author had anticipated widespread controversy, they would likely have avoided publishing the book in the first place.""

These statements lack depth and fail to provide concrete evidence to support the claims. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""As you can see,"" becomes repetitive and loses its effectiveness.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish.

The writer presents a clear and passionate stance against censorship in libraries, citing the importance of freedom of choice and access to various forms of media. The essay effectively conveys the writer's personal experience and opinions, making it relatable and engaging.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple aspects of censorship, including books, music, and the internet. The writer provides valid arguments, such as the need for access to diverse perspectives and the potential consequences of censorship on personal growth and development. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issues.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, adds depth and context to the essay. The inclusion of specific examples, such as ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" helps to illustrate the writer's points and makes the essay more convincing.

The writer's tone is generally persuasive, but there are moments where it becomes overly emotional and lacks objectivity. For instance, the phrase ""the bomb"" and ""obscene"" may be perceived as sensationalized language. Additionally, the writer's assertion that ""we can't read some of the classics because they're 'racist' or 'pornographic'"" oversimplifies the complexities of literary criticism and historical context.

The writer skillfully uses personal anecdotes, such as the example of the National Geographic magazine and the magazine @CAPS1, to illustrate their point and demonstrate that not all content is inherently offensive.

The writer also effectively employs the concept of the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and press, to support their argument.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about the importance of patience, which is a valuable life skill for middle school students to learn. The writer effectively conveys the feeling of frustration and excitement that comes with waiting for something, in this case, a pair of shoes.

However, the essay could benefit from some refinement in terms of organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the frustration of waiting to the excitement of receiving the shoes, without a clear connection between the two. Additionally, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.

The writer also relies heavily on abbreviations and slang (e.g., ""l,"" ""thaught,"" ""goin""), which may not be familiar to all readers. While it's understandable that the writer is trying to convey a sense of youthful voice and informality, it's essential to balance this with clear and concise language.

For instance, the sentence ""No I don't think any adult material should be cencered"" should be ""No, I don't think any adult material should be censored."" Furthermore, the lack of coherence and organization makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of personal responsibility to making a blanket statement about libraries.

The writer also fails to provide a clear and convincing argument in support of their stance. While they mention that children will learn about mature content in school, this does not necessarily mean that it should be banned from libraries. In fact, libraries provide a safe and controlled environment for children to access a wide range of materials, including adult content, under the guidance of a librarian or parent.

In conclusion, while the writer's passion and personal anecdotes make for an engaging essay, the writing quality and organization are lacking. With some revisions to address the grammatical errors and provide a more coherent and convincing argument, this essay could be a strong contender for a higher score.

The essay provides a vivid description of a cyclist's experience in a challenging environment, but it lacks a clear and focused exploration of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer attempts to describe the setting, but the connection between the setting and the cyclist's experience is not explicitly stated. 

For instance, the writer mentions that the cyclist had to listen to older men to get where she was going, which suggests that the setting may be a rural or isolated area. However, this information is not directly linked to how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer also mentions that the cyclist had to run out of water and almost died of thirst, which implies that the setting may be hot and dry. However, this information is not explicitly connected to the features of the setting.

The writer's use of sensory details, such as the description of the snake, adds to the vividness of the scene, but it does not provide a clear connection to how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer's writing style is descriptive, but it lacks a clear structure and organization.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on explicitly explaining how the features of the setting affect the cyclist's experience. For example, the writer could analyze how the heat and isolation of the setting contributed to the cyclist's thirst and near-death experience.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various obstacles together. The student has provided some relevant information, such as the need to modify the frame to reduce stress and obtain the right equipment from the air station. Nevertheless, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the obstacles to listing them without a clear connection between each point.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the essay lacks a clear and concise structure, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The writer seems to have mixed up the context of the Empire State Building's construction with the dirigibles, as the excerpt provided does not mention the Empire State Building's construction or Al Smith's involvement.

The writer provides some relevant information about the obstacles faced by dirigibles, such as the problems with docking due to wind and the elements, the need for helium fuel, and the laws restricting airships from flying low over urban areas. However, these points are not well-supported by the provided excerpt and seem to be unrelated to the Empire State Building's construction.

The writer also fails to provide specific details about the dirigibles' docking issues and the impact of the Hindenburg crash on the dirigibles' design. The transition between the different obstacles is abrupt, and the writer jumps between different ideas without clear connections.

The writer's essay presents a well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society.

The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their stance, making the argument more relatable and engaging. The use of rhetorical devices, such as the quote from Katherine Paterson, adds depth and context to the discussion.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple perspectives on the issue. The writer acknowledges that some people may find certain materials offensive, but argues that removing them from libraries would not solve the problem. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the issue and a willingness to consider different viewpoints.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. Some sentences are simplistic and lack variety, which can make the writing feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention that people have the freedom to choose what they read, they do not provide any specific examples of how this freedom is being threatened by censorship.

Furthermore, the writer could strengthen their argument by addressing potential counterarguments more explicitly. For example, they could acknowledge that some people may argue that removing offensive materials would protect children from exposure to mature themes, and respond to this concern in a thoughtful and well-reasoned way.

The writer's ability to transition between the narrative of their personal experience and the introduction of the new neighbor is well-executed, making the story feel organic and engaging. The use of rhetorical devices, such as the phrase ""I was the only person in the whole world,"" effectively conveys the writer's feelings of isolation and loneliness.

The author's use of rhetorical questions and personal anecdotes effectively conveys their concerns about the potential impact of banned books on children. However, the essay lacks a clear and well-structured argument, relying heavily on emotional appeals and simplistic solutions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's use of a quote from Katherine Paterson, which adds depth and context to the discussion. The quote highlights the importance of considering the perspectives of all individuals when making decisions about censorship. However, the writer fails to fully engage with Paterson's ideas, instead using the quote as a starting point for their own opinions.

The writer's proposal for categorizing books into separate sections based on age and content is also an interesting idea. However, it is not well-supported by evidence or logical reasoning. The writer's suggestion that books should be banned only if they are ""sexist, racist, have a lot of sex, or are really gruesome"" is overly broad and subjective, and fails to consider the complexities of individual perspectives and experiences.

Furthermore, the writer's proposal for a meeting involving the mayor, teachers, and parents to decide which books to ban is a good idea, but it is not a comprehensive solution to the issue of censorship. It does not address the underlying concerns about the impact of censorship on intellectual freedom and the importance of diverse perspectives in literature.

The writer effectively uses anecdotes and specific details to illustrate their point, making the narrative engaging and easy to follow. The use of first-person narration allows the reader to connect with the writer's emotions and experiences, making the story more impactful.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the complexities of relationships and the consequences of one's actions. The writer's decision to pursue a relationship with someone while keeping it a secret from their parents is a relatable and realistic scenario that highlights the challenges of navigating social pressures and personal desires. The writer's growth and apology towards the end of the essay demonstrate a mature understanding of the importance of accountability and forgiveness.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, which sometimes feel disconnected. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity and flow of the narrative. The writer could also benefit from more nuanced analysis of the role of laughter in the story, exploring its impact on the characters and the relationships.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and tone is often informal, which may not be suitable for a formal essay. While the use of colloquial expressions and slang adds a touch of authenticity, it may not be accessible to all readers. The writer should consider using more formal language to convey their message effectively.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong narrative voice and a clear message about the importance of laughter in relationships. With revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the writer has the potential to produce a more polished and effective essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey Saeng's resilience and determination. This conclusion effectively reinforces the theme of perseverance and adaptation, as Saeng has been struggling to adjust to her new life in a foreign country. The author skillfully uses the image of the winter hibiscus, which is not the same as the one in Vietnam, to illustrate Saeng's longing for her homeland. By planting this type of flower and waiting until spring to take the driving test, Saeng is able to temporarily escape the difficulties of her current situation and hold onto her memories of her homeland.

The author's use of the phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" is particularly effective in conveying the idea of renewal and new beginnings. The geese, which are often associated with spring and new life, serve as a symbol of hope and promise, suggesting that better times are ahead for Saeng. The image of the hibiscus blooming in the spring also adds to the sense of renewal and rejuvenation, as it is a flower that is often associated with warmth and beauty.

Furthermore, the author's decision to have Saeng wait until spring to take the driving test demonstrates her willingness to put off challenges until a more opportune time. This decision also highlights her resourcefulness and determination, as she is able to find ways to cope with her difficulties and hold onto her goals.

Overall, the conclusion of the story is a powerful and effective way to convey Saeng's resilience and determination, and serves as a fitting ending to the narrative.

The student's essay provides a relatable and engaging story about a time when they were patient, despite being in a difficult situation. The story effectively conveys the importance of patience and understanding in dealing with challenging emotions and behaviors. The student's use of first-person narration and vivid descriptions, such as ""I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket"" and ""Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes,"" helps to create a immersive experience for the reader.

However, the essay could benefit from some refinement in terms of grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. There are several instances of misspelled words, such as ""buring"" instead of ""burning,"" ""fore years"" instead of ""four years,"" and ""happe"" instead of ""happy."" Additionally, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.

The student also struggles with punctuation and capitalization, as evident from the numerous instances of incorrect use of capitalization and punctuation marks. For example, the sentence ""Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”"" should be rewritten as ""Immediately after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later, she came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said, 'I made mama make you some tea.'""

Despite these issues, the student's message about the importance of patience and understanding shines through. The essay effectively conveys the student's growth and self-awareness, as they acknowledge that they were not patient at the beginning but were able to manage their emotions and respond in a more patient manner.

To improve, the student should focus on refining their grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. They should also pay closer attention to punctuation and capitalization. With further practice and attention to detail, the student has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to provide a sense of closure and resolution to the narrative. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and hope that are present throughout the story. The author's decision to set the conclusion in the spring, a season often associated with renewal and new beginnings, reinforces this theme.

The use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the promise of new opportunities. The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to take the test again also suggests that she has learned from her past experiences and is determined to succeed.

Furthermore, the conclusion serves as a message of hope and encouragement, implying that with time and effort, one can overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The author's use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of determination and commitment, underscoring Saeng's resolve to take the test again.

Overall, the conclusion effectively wraps up the narrative, leaving the reader with a sense of closure and a renewed sense of hope for the future.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the various points together. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the safety concerns to mentioning existing laws, without providing a clear connection between the two. Furthermore, the student fails to provide specific examples or evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, the student mentions that the helium in the balloons is highly flammable, but does not provide any information about the specific risks associated with this flammability. Additionally, the student's transition between ideas is often abrupt, making the essay feel disjointed and lacking in cohesion.

The student also fails to address the issue of wind resistance, which is mentioned in the excerpt as a significant challenge. The student mentions that the back of the ship would swivel around and around, but does not explain how this would impact the docking process. The student's conclusion that the mooring mast never became a reality due to these obstacles is also unsupported by the provided evidence.

To improve, the student should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement that ties together the various points, and provide specific examples and evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. The student should also work on improving their transitions between ideas and addressing all the obstacles mentioned in the excerpt.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses various reasons to support their claim, including education, hand-eye coordination, and social interaction. However, the essay lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow at times. The writer also relies heavily on personal anecdotes and examples, which, although engaging, do not provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and highlight the benefits of computers in various aspects of life, such as education, sports, and social interaction. The writer's use of specific examples, such as using computers to study for tests and play sports, helps to illustrate their points. Additionally, the writer's passion and conviction in their argument are evident throughout the essay, making it engaging to read.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to organization and structure. The writer jumps abruptly from one topic to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The writer also fails to address counterarguments or provide evidence to refute opposing views, which would strengthen their argument. Furthermore, the writer's use of slang and informal language, such as ""rapping things up"" and ""you can talk to your friends,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

In conclusion, while the essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers, it could benefit from more attention to organization, structure, and evidence-based arguments.

The essay provides a clear and relatable explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to convey the cyclist's physical and emotional state, such as ""The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever"" and ""The sun makes him even hotter, not he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty."" These examples demonstrate the writer's ability to use vivid imagery to engage the reader.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the physical effects of the setting to the emotional impact, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, the writer could have used more transitional phrases or sentences to connect the ideas between paragraphs.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples from the essay to support their claims. For example, they could have referenced specific sentences or phrases that illustrate how the setting affects the cyclist's mood or physical state. This would have strengthened their argument and made their analysis more convincing.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored the theme of the essay more deeply. While they touch on the idea that the setting affects the cyclist's mood, they could have delved deeper into the symbolism of the abandoned towns and the bait shop. How do these elements represent the cyclist's hopes and fears? What do they reveal about the cyclist's character?

However, the writer's emotional investment in their situation and their desire to care for their mother are palpable.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to convey their feelings and emotions through their writing. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I feel like there just wasn't enough time in the day to do everything I would like to do"" and ""I'm going to be one tired teen age boy"" effectively convey their frustration and exhaustion.

The writer also correctly identifies the conflict that arises from the excessive heat, which is a direct result of the setting.

However, there are areas for improvement in the essay. The writer could benefit from more precise language and sentence structure.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more analysis of the cyclist's character development throughout the story. The transition between the cyclist's initial gratitude towards the old men's advice and his later frustration could be smoother.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored the setting's impact on the cyclist's physical and emotional state in more depth.

The writer's primary argument is that computers have a positive impact on society, citing several benefits such as socialization, education, and business opportunities. However, the essay lacks a clear and structured approach, with ideas presented in a disjointed and simplistic manner. The writer often uses abbreviations and misspellings, which detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's enthusiasm and conviction in their argument. They effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition (""computers have benifited our society"") and emotive language (""it's amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer"") to persuade the reader. However, these devices are often used in a way that comes across as insincere or immature.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention that computers have made socialization easier, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. Similarly, their claims about the impact of computers on education and business are based on general statements rather than concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspellings. This detracts from the overall quality of the essay and makes it difficult to take the writer's argument seriously.

The student's essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom of expression and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the student's argument is largely based on a simplistic and dismissive approach, failing to provide concrete evidence or nuanced analysis to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the lack of organization and coherence. The writing is often fragmented, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear structure. The student jumps between different topics, such as movies, books, and magazines, without providing a clear connection between them. This makes it difficult to follow the author's train of thought and understand their overall argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""if they dont like it I think they should just leave it alone.What some people might find offensive others will find interesting"" is unclear and difficult to understand. Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions, such as ""alot"" and ""there's,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

The student also fails to provide any concrete evidence or examples to support their claims. While they mention specific instances of people making a fuss over certain books or movies, they do not analyze these examples in depth or provide any insight into the underlying issues. This lack of analysis and evidence-based reasoning makes the essay feel superficial and unconvincing.

In terms of addressing the issue of censorship, the student's suggestion that people should ""just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about themselves"" is overly simplistic and unrealistic. Censorship is often a complex issue that involves balancing individual freedom of expression with the need to protect vulnerable groups or individuals from harm. The student's approach fails to acknowledge the potential consequences of censorship and the importance of considering multiple perspectives.

Overall, while the student's essay raises some interesting points, it is ultimately lacking in terms of organization, analysis, and evidence-based reasoning. With further development and refinement, the student has the potential to produce a more compelling and persuasive essay.

The author effectively employs descriptive language to convey the cyclist's emotions and physical struggles, drawing the reader into the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of vivid imagery, such as ""mediocre water supply,"" ""hot desert,"" and ""dwindling spirit."" These phrases effectively convey the cyclist's physical and emotional state, making the reader feel the intensity of his struggles. However, some of these phrases, such as ""physicall, emotional & mental trials,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

The author also demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of perseverance and self-reliance. The cyclist's decision to ""rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time"" showcases his determination and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. This decision also serves as a turning point in the narrative, where the cyclist shifts from feeling ""skrewed over"" to finding inner strength.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. While the author mentions the ""flat and hilly terrain,"" the connection to the setting's features is not fully explored. For example, how did the terrain affect the cyclist's physical and emotional state? How did the environment influence his decision-making process?

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument on the impact of computers on society. The writer effectively uses various points to support their claim that computers have a positive effect on people, including teaching hand-eye coordination, providing access to information, and facilitating communication. The writer also addresses counterarguments, such as the potential negative effects of excessive computer use, and provides examples to refute these concerns.

However, the essay could benefit from several areas of improvement. Firstly, the writing lacks clarity and coherence in some places. The writer often uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks transitional phrases, making the text feel disjointed. Additionally, there are grammatical errors and typos throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on clichéd phrases and overused expressions, such as ""in our socity"" and ""can inhance use to people."" These phrases do not add much depth or originality to the argument and can be seen as lazy writing.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention that computers can teach hand-eye coordination, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. Similarly, they claim that computers can help people learn about culture and life, but do not provide any concrete examples or references to support this claim.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear and well-structured argument. With further refinement and attention to grammar, clarity, and evidence-based support, this essay has the potential to be even stronger.

The essay effectively explores the impact of the setting on the cyclist's emotional state, effectively using vivid imagery and metaphors to convey the protagonist's feelings of hopelessness and despair. The writer skillfully employs sensory details, such as the description of the ""dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain"" and the ""Welch's Grape Juice Factory"" in the distance, to create a sense of desolation and isolation. The use of the phrase ""the desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people"" effectively highlights the cyclist's desperation and vulnerability.

The writer also effectively uses the cyclist's thoughts and dialogue to illustrate his emotional state, such as when he says ""with any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat"" when talking about pebbles in his mouth. This line effectively conveys the cyclist's desperation and willingness to risk his own life to alleviate his suffering.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and a clearer structure. At times, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's physical state to comparing him to others, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. While the essay effectively conveys the cyclist's emotional state, it does not fully explore the ways in which the setting shapes his thoughts, feelings, and actions. For example, the writer could have delved deeper into the symbolism of the Welch's Grape Juice Factory and how it represents the cyclist's longing for sustenance and comfort.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt and effectively uses descriptive language to convey the cyclist's emotional state. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the essay has the potential to be even more effective in exploring the impact of the setting on the cyclist.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses specific examples to support their claims, such as the speed of accessing information online and the availability of news updates. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its discussion of the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use. The writer's tone is generally enthusiastic and persuasive, but it sometimes veers into a casual, conversational tone that detracts from the formal tone expected in a letter to the newspaper.

One area for improvement is the writer's reliance on vague terms like ""cool games"" and ""funny videos."" While these examples may be relatable to the writer, they do not provide a compelling argument for the benefits of computers. The writer could have delved deeper into the educational or social benefits of computers, such as the ability to connect with others or access educational resources.

Additionally, the writer's use of abbreviations and informal language, such as ""wich"" and ""@CAPS1,"" detracts from the formal tone of the essay. While the writer has made an effort to remove personally identifying information, the use of abbreviations and informal language still detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph, providing a sense of closure and resolution for the character Saeng. The conclusion highlights Saeng's determination to adapt to her new home and move forward with her life, rather than dwelling on past memories. The author supports this conclusion by showing Saeng's emotional state in the previous scene, where she is still grieving and nostalgic for her old home. The sentence ""I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-"" serves as a turning point, as it marks a shift from sadness to acceptance.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, with the writer arguing against it. However, the writing quality and organization of the essay leave much to be desired. The writer's arguments are not well-supported, and the text is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to engage with the topic in a meaningful way.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the writer's lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The writer's opening sentence is a quote from Katherine Paterson, but it does not provide a clear direction for the rest of the essay. The writer then jumps abruptly into a general statement about people being offended by uncensored materials, without providing any evidence or analysis to support this claim.

Furthermore, the writer's arguments against censorship are not well-developed. The writer states that censorship takes away from freedom of speech, but this is a simplistic and overly broad claim. The writer does not provide any specific examples or evidence to support this claim, and it is not clear how censorship would necessarily take away from freedom of speech.

The writer also fails to engage with the complexities of the issue. Censorship is not simply a matter of ""either/or,"" but rather a nuanced issue that requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. The writer does not address any potential benefits of censorship, such as protecting children from explicit or harmful content, and instead relies on a blanket statement that censorship is always wrong.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure. The writer jumps between different ideas without any clear transitions or connections between paragraphs. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, including misspellings, run-on sentences, and lack of punctuation.

Overall, while the writer's stance on censorship is clear, the essay lacks the writing quality and organization necessary to support a persuasive argument.

The writer jumps abruptly from describing their cousin's behavior to expressing their own feelings about their relationship, which disrupts the flow of the essay.

The writer also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the phrase ""especilly"" should be spelled as ""especially,"" and ""nervers"" should be spelled as ""nerves."" Additionally, the writer uses colloquial expressions like ""I don't like her at all"" and ""I don't think so,"" which may not be suitable for a formal essay.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing on the quote from Katherine Paterson to emphasize the importance of individual freedom of choice. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and accessible to a middle school audience.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address the complexity of the issue. The writer acknowledges that some materials may be offensive to certain individuals, but argues that this does not justify censorship. The example of slavery is a particularly effective way to illustrate this point, as it highlights the importance of understanding historical events and the need for diverse perspectives.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer relies heavily on simplistic statements, such as ""people should not take it seriously about books or other sources because it can be nonfiction or fiction."" This type of language does not fully capture the complexity of the issue and may not resonate with readers who are familiar with more nuanced discussions of censorship.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the role of authors to arguing that parents are responsible for their children's choices. A more cohesive structure would help to strengthen the overall argument and make it easier to follow.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words.

The essay provided is a creative and imaginative piece that explores the concept of patience, albeit in a non-traditional manner. The writer has successfully incorporated the prompt's requirements, albeit with a science fiction twist. The use of an alien invasion as a backdrop to discuss patience is an innovative approach, and the writer's enthusiasm is evident throughout the essay.

However, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow. The narrative jumps abruptly from introducing the alien invasion to the introduction of the fighters and the king, without a clear connection between the two. The writing style is also quite simplistic, with phrases such as ""beat the crud out of them"" and ""the earth was saved,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the essay fails to demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of patience. While the writer mentions that patience means being understanding and tolerant, they do not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support this claim. The essay's focus on action and violence rather than introspection and self-reflection also detracts from the exploration of patience.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay contains several errors, including grammatical mistakes, run-on sentences, and inconsistent punctuation.

The essay effectively explores how the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience throughout the story. The author skillfully weaves together various elements of the setting to create a narrative that highlights the challenges and triumphs of the cyclist. One notable aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist is the isolation and desolation of the wilderness. The author masterfully conveys the cyclist's growing sense of unease and desperation as he navigates through the deserted towns and encounters various obstacles, such as the inedible water and the snake blocking the pavement. For instance, when the cyclist arrives at the well and finds the water to be inedible, it is a clear indication of the harsh conditions he is facing. This event serves as a turning point in the story, as it heightens the cyclist's physical and emotional distress.

Another significant aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist is the rugged terrain. The author skillfully describes the ""ridiculously large snake"" blocking the pavement, which not only poses a physical threat but also serves as a metaphor for the numerous challenges the cyclist faces. The cyclist's decision to continue pedaling despite these obstacles showcases his resilience and determination. The author's vivid descriptions of the natural beauty of Yosemite, such as the ""cool pines and rushing rivers,"" serve as a contrast to the harsh conditions, highlighting the cyclist's motivation and resolve.

The author's use of sensory details effectively immerses the reader in the story, making it easy to visualize the setting and its impact on the cyclist. For example, the image of the cyclist putting rocks in his mouth to help with dehydration is a powerful and vivid description that conveys the cyclist's desperation and resourcefulness.

However, there are areas where the essay could be improved. At times, the writing feels a bit simplistic, and some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, as some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the essay.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation, relying heavily on simplistic solutions and anecdotal evidence.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to engage the reader with a personal story. The author's account of their experience with their brother bringing an adult book to the library is a relatable and attention-grabbing anecdote. However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated analysis and supporting evidence to strengthen its argument.

The author's suggestion to separate adult books and materials from children's sections is a reasonable proposal, but it does not address the underlying issue of censorship. The essay could explore the implications of censorship on freedom of expression and the potential consequences of restricting access to certain materials.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. The writing is often simplistic and lacks polish, which detracts from the overall impact of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from the author's personal experience to their proposed solution, without a clear logical connection between the two. A more cohesive structure and clearer transitions would improve the flow of the essay.

Overall, while the essay raises an important issue, it requires more development and refinement to make a compelling argument.

The essay provides a unique and creative take on the concept of patience, using a spy narrative to illustrate the importance of this virtue. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the scene, drawing the reader into the story. The inclusion of sensory details, such as the sound of the clock and the feeling of boredom, helps to create a immersive experience.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the initial assignment to the actual mission, and the transitions between scenes feel somewhat disjointed. Additionally, some sentences are overly simplistic or lack clarity, which detracts from the overall impact of the narrative.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, with several instances of misspelled words and incorrect use of capitalization. While the anonymization of personal details is appreciated, some phrases, such as ""I here"" and ""i start to doodlle,"" are unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Despite these issues, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience and its application in the story. The conclusion effectively ties together the themes of patience and the writer's ability to successfully complete the mission.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph to convey a message of hope and renewal for the character Saeng. The use of spring as a symbol of birth and renewal is a powerful tool in illustrating Saeng's second chance at taking the test. The author skillfully weaves in details from the story, such as Saeng's past struggles with the test and her mother's words of encouragement, to emphasize the significance of the hibiscus as a representation of Saeng's resilience. The comparison of the hibiscus to Saeng's past self, highlighting its strength and ability to ""make it through the cold months,"" demonstrates the author's ability to create a nuanced and meaningful conclusion. However, the analysis could benefit from more depth and complexity, as some of the connections between the hibiscus and Saeng's character feel somewhat obvious.

The writer's argument against the benefits of computers on society is well-structured and easy to follow. The essay begins by acknowledging the opposing view, which shows that the writer has considered multiple perspectives. However, the writer's tone is often informal and lacks objectivity, with phrases such as ""I has come to my attention"" and ""I am sure you will agree."" This detracts from the credibility of the argument.

The writer provides some valid points, such as the negative impact of excessive computer use on physical health and the importance of spending time with family and friends. However, these points are not supported by concrete evidence and are often based on anecdotal experiences. For example, the writer claims that a surgeon at an organization has stated that electronics are the main culprit behind obesity, but there is no citation or reference to this source.

The writer also fails to provide a clear and convincing solution to the problems they have identified. Instead of offering alternatives to computer use, they simply suggest that people should ""get outside"" or go to the gym. This is a vague and unrealistic solution that does not address the root causes of the problems.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and informal language (e.g., ""I has come to my attention"" instead of ""I have come across""). This detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, while the writer has raised some valid points, their argument is not convincing due to a lack of objectivity, lack of evidence, and poor writing quality.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging account of a personal experience with patience. The writer effectively conveys their emotions and thoughts throughout the story, making it easy to visualize the scene. The use of capital letters to emphasize excitement and frustration is a creative way to convey the writer's feelings, although it may not be the most conventional writing technique.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. The writing lacks cohesion and transitions between sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow. The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""I was @CAPS2 happy"" should be written as ""I was so happy"" to improve clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. The use of phrases like ""I was really really mad"" and ""I hate try on clothes"" is repetitive and doesn't add much depth to the story. Additionally, the writer could have explored the concept of patience more deeply, discussing what it means to be patient and how it relates to the experience.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite National Park. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion. For instance, the description of the old timers at the reservoir campground, who advised the cyclist to take a shortcut, is a great example of how the setting can lead to difficulties. The writer also effectively uses sensory details, such as the warmth of the sun and the dryness of the high deserts of California in June, to convey the challenges the cyclist faces. However, the writer could improve their writing by providing more nuanced and detailed analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence.

One area for improvement is the use of transitional phrases and connections between ideas. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the old timers to describing the effects of dehydration. A more cohesive transition would help to create a smoother flow of ideas. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more precise vocabulary and sentence structure. For example, instead of using the phrase ""toslice away hours from my ride,"" the writer could say ""the shortcut saved me hours of riding time.""

One of the notable strengths of the essay is the use of sensory details, such as the description of the high deserts of California as ""hot, parched, and irritable.""

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is that removing books and other materials deemed offensive would lead to a loss of freedom of expression and ultimately, a loss of the very things that can change the world. However, the writer's argument is marred by several issues, including a lack of clarity, grammatical errors, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns with the writer's argument is that it relies heavily on vague statements and generalizations. For instance, the writer claims that ""some stuff can change out of the world"" without providing any specific examples or explanations of how this would occur. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to understand the writer's position and evaluate the validity of their argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""weak-minded people"" and ""get the weak mind in trouble"" is problematic. These statements imply that certain individuals are inherently vulnerable to the influence of certain materials, which is not supported by empirical evidence. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that removing certain materials would prevent people from acting on their thoughts is overly simplistic and ignores the complexities of human behavior.

The writer also fails to acknowledge the importance of diverse perspectives and the value of exposure to different ideas and viewpoints. By advocating for the removal of materials deemed offensive, the writer is essentially advocating for a form of intellectual censorship that would stifle free expression and limit the exchange of ideas.

In conclusion, while the writer raises some valid concerns about the potential impact of certain materials on individuals, their argument is ultimately flawed due to its lack of clarity, vagueness, and reliance on unsubstantiated claims. A more nuanced and evidence-based approach to addressing concerns about censorship in libraries would be more effective in promoting a more informed and thoughtful discussion.

The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the significance of laughter in breaking down barriers and fostering connections with others. The inclusion of specific details, such as the writer's concerns about language barriers and the eventual ease of communication with younger relatives, adds depth to the narrative.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, which sometimes feel disconnected. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity of the writing. The writer could also benefit from more nuanced analysis of the role of laughter in the narrative, moving beyond a straightforward description of its effects.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored more diverse perspectives on the topic, considering the experiences of others who may not have had the same level of success in using laughter to bridge cultural divides. The essay's focus on the writer's personal experience, while relatable, limits its broader relevance.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and personal growth that are woven throughout the narrative. The author's decision to conclude the story at this point is significant because it highlights Saeng's determination to overcome her struggles and take the test again, much like the natural world around her.

The author's use of natural imagery, such as the ""hibiscus is budding"" and ""the snow melts,"" serves to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and the promise of new beginnings. By linking her own personal growth to the natural world, the author creates a powerful metaphor that underscores the idea that Saeng is capable of renewal and transformation. This conclusion also serves to underscore the idea that Saeng's journey is not just about overcoming obstacles, but also about embracing the cyclical nature of life.

Furthermore, the author's decision to conclude the story in the spring, a time of renewal and growth, suggests that she is positioning Saeng's journey as a journey of personal growth and development. By linking Saeng's growth to the natural world, the author creates a sense of hope and possibility that is both inspiring and empowering.

In terms of writing quality, the essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the story and its themes.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers in society. The writer effectively uses various examples to support their claim, such as the importance of computers in education, entertainment, and business. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of supporting evidence. The writer also relies heavily on simplistic language and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and highlight the benefits of computers in different areas of life, such as learning, entertainment, and business. The writer also provides some relevant examples, such as the use of computers in hospitals and the importance of computers in finding information about black history and famous people. However, these points are not fully developed and could be supported with more evidence and analysis.

The writer's writing style is informal and lacks polish, with frequent use of abbreviations, slang, and grammatical errors. The essay also lacks a clear structure and organization, with ideas presented in a disjointed and confusing manner. The writer's tone is also somewhat defensive and dismissive of opposing views, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness of the essay.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing their ideas more fully, using more sophisticated language and evidence to support their claims. They should also work on organizing their essay more clearly and logically, using transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas. Additionally, the writer should strive to use more formal language and avoid grammatical errors.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the text to support their conclusion, demonstrating a good understanding of the narrative. However, the writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the sentences could be more varied in structure and length.

One area for improvement is the use of transitional phrases and words to connect ideas between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's confidence in the first town to his feelings of worry and despair upon encountering the old shed. Adding transitional phrases, such as ""In addition,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Meanwhile,"" could help to smooth out the flow of the essay.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. While the writer identifies specific examples, they do not fully explore the underlying themes or symbolism behind these events. For instance, the old shed could represent the cyclist's dwindling resources or the harsh realities of the wilderness, while the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes could symbolize the cyclist's feelings of isolation and vulnerability.

Furthermore, the writer could improve their writing style by using more descriptive language and vivid imagery. The phrase ""I believe this because in the text he says"" is a bit generic and could be replaced with more specific quotes or paraphrased language to engage the reader.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides some effective examples from the text. With further refinement in terms of organization, analysis, and writing style, the essay could be even stronger.

The essay provides a brief attempt to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and coherence. The writer attempts to relate a personal experience to the concept of patience, but the story is disjointed and lacks clear structure. The writer fails to provide specific details about the experience, such as the emotions they felt, the challenges they overcame, or what they learned from the experience. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""are"" instead of ""our"" and ""got in are deer blind"" instead of ""got into our deer blind.""

The writer's attempt to tie the story to the concept of patience is also unclear. While they claim that waiting all day for deer to appear is an example of patience, the essay does not provide any analysis or reflection on what they learned from the experience or how it helped them develop patience. The conclusion feels abrupt and does not provide a clear takeaway from the story.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing a more detailed and structured narrative that explores the concept of patience in a more nuanced way. They should also proofread their work for grammatical errors and provide a more thoughtful conclusion that ties the story back to the concept of patience.

The essay provides a brief description of a cyclist's experience, but it lacks depth and clarity in its analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist. The writer attempts to make a connection between the setting and the cyclist's emotions, but the statement ""He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong"" is an oversimplification and lacks concrete evidence from the essay to support this claim. The writer also fails to provide specific examples from the essay to illustrate how the setting influences the cyclist's actions or emotions.

For instance, the essay mentions that the cyclist is going up and down steep hills, but it does not explain how this affects the cyclist's physical or mental state. The writer could have explored how the cyclist's isolation and the challenging terrain impact their motivation, focus, or overall experience.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and relatable examples to illustrate the convenience and accessibility of computers, making it easy for readers to understand their perspective. The use of rhetorical devices such as repetition (""All good qualities..."") and metaphors (""The computer has changed the way we do almost everything today"") adds to the persuasive tone of the essay.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The writer primarily focuses on the benefits of computers without adequately addressing the concerns of those who oppose their use. This one-sided approach may not fully engage readers who may have different opinions on the matter. Additionally, the writer often relies on vague statements (""All in all..."") and simplistic phrases (""who could hate it?""), which detract from the overall credibility of the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. For instance, the sentence ""Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying instead on general statements and personal opinions.

Despite these limitations, the essay demonstrates a clear enthusiasm for the benefits of computers and effectively conveys the writer's perspective. With further refinement and attention to grammar, syntax, and evidence-based argumentation, the essay could be significantly improved.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph where Saeng vows to retake the test in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, resilience, and the connection to home. The author's decision to end the story at this point is supported by the narrative's focus on Saeng's emotional state and her desire to return to her home.

The paragraph in question highlights Saeng's emotional connection to the hibiscus flower, which serves as a symbol of her longing for home. The fact that she recalls the flower's previous blooms and associates it with her past experiences suggests that she is homesick. The line ""Not like the kind we had before"" implies that Saeng is yearning for a sense of comfort and familiarity, which is further emphasized by her desire to retake the test in the spring, when the flower blooms again. This conclusion effectively conveys Saeng's emotional state and her determination to overcome her current challenges.

Furthermore, the author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image of the changing seasons and Saeng's emotional journey. The author's decision to conclude the story at this point effectively captures the essence of Saeng's character and the narrative's themes, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and renewal.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about the importance of laughter in a personal relationship. The writer effectively conveys their personal experience of helping a friend in need and the positive impact of laughter on their emotional state. The use of descriptive language, such as ""loud crying,"" ""shaky hands,"" and ""laughed hysterically,"" effectively conveys the intensity of the situation and the writer's emotions.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the situation to explaining the lesson learned, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The writer also relies heavily on the use of first-person pronouns, which can make the essay feel more like a personal anecdote than a well-structured essay. While this can be effective in conveying the writer's personal experience, it may not be suitable for a more formal essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to convey the emotional impact of laughter on their friend's well-being. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I felt so relief"" and ""I was happy I made her laugh"" effectively conveys the positive outcome of the situation.

In terms of supporting evidence, the writer provides a clear and concise narrative that illustrates the importance of laughter in a personal relationship. The story is engaging and easy to follow, and the writer's use of sensory details effectively brings the reader into the scene.

The writer presents a well-structured and passionate argument against censorship in libraries, citing various forms of media, including books, movies, music, and magazines. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their stance, making the argument more relatable and convincing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to address multiple forms of media and provide thoughtful arguments for each. For instance, the writer discusses the importance of books in teaching children about sensitive topics, such as slavery and infidelity, and argues that removing these books from shelves would deprive children of valuable information. Similarly, the writer makes a compelling case for the inclusion of movies and magazines that tackle difficult subjects, such as poverty and human rights, in a way that is accessible to children.

However, the writer's argument is not without its weaknesses. At times, the writing can be overly simplistic, with some sentences feeling like they are more like statements than fully formed arguments. Additionally, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their claims. For example, instead of simply stating that ""some movies have graphic content,"" the writer could provide specific examples of films that they believe should be available to children.

The writer effectively identifies several elements of the setting, including the extreme heat, rough road, bumps, hills, and wildlife, and explains how they impacted the cyclist's journey. However, the writer could benefit from providing more specific and detailed examples to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions that the speaker had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst, but it would be helpful to know more about the context and the speaker's emotional state during this moment.

Additionally, the writer could have explored the theme of the story more deeply. While the writer mentions that the problems in the story affected the speaker's journey to Yosemite National Park, they do not fully develop this idea. The writer could have analyzed how the setting and its features relate to the overall theme of the story, such as the challenges of nature or the human body's limitations.

Furthermore, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and the cyclist's experience. The writer's writing is straightforward and lacks descriptive details, which makes it difficult to visualize the scene.

Overall, the essay provides a good starting point for exploring the relationship between the setting and the cyclist, but could benefit from more analysis, detail, and descriptive language.

The essay provides a basic attempt to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and clarity in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer mentions several factors, such as ""bad conditions of the road,"" ""not sun,"" ""desserts,"" and ""low amount of energy supply,"" but fails to provide a cohesive and well-supported argument. The writer seems to be listing individual elements without connecting them to the overall impact on the cyclist.

For instance, the writer mentions ""bad conditions of the road,"" but does not elaborate on how these conditions specifically affect the cyclist's experience or performance. Similarly, the mention of ""not sun"" is unclear, as it is not specified how the lack of sunlight affects the cyclist. The writer also fails to provide any concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simplistic and lacks variety, with short, simple sentences that do not engage the reader. The writer could benefit from more descriptive language and a clearer structure to effectively convey their ideas.

To improve, the writer should focus on selecting a few key features of the setting and providing more detailed explanations of how they impact the cyclist. They should also strive to use more descriptive language and provide concrete examples to support their claims.

The writer's argument against censorship in libraries is well-structured and supported by relevant points. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. The writer also raises a valid point about the role of parents in supervising their children's access to library materials.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The writer relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""people have different cultures and beliefs"" and ""parents need to have full supervision."" These statements are true, but they do not provide much insight into the complexities of censorship and its impact on society.

Furthermore, the writer's argument is not entirely convincing. While it is true that parents should be responsible for their children's access to library materials, it is also true that some materials may be so objectionable that they should be removed from circulation. The writer's suggestion that libraries should maintain their current censorship policies without any change is not well-supported, as it ignores the potential harm that certain materials can cause to vulnerable individuals.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks clarity. Sentences are often short and lack transitions, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow. The writer also relies on abbreviations and acronyms (e.g., ""@CAPS1"") that are not clearly explained, which can be confusing for the reader.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid points, the essay could benefit from more in-depth analysis, clearer writing, and more convincing arguments.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student has provided some relevant information from the excerpt, but the connections between the ideas are not well-developed, and the writing lacks cohesion.

The student has identified the main obstacle as the stress on the building's frame due to the dirigible's load and wind pressure. This is a correct interpretation of the excerpt. However, the student could have elaborated on this point by explaining how the stress would have affected the building's structural integrity and the potential consequences of not addressing this issue.

The student has also mentioned that over sixty thousand dollars would need to be spent on modifications to accommodate the dirigible. This is a specific detail from the excerpt, but the student could have used this information to support their argument more effectively. For example, they could have explained how the cost of modifications would have impacted the overall budget of the project.

Furthermore, the student has stated that new modifications were only made to support the blimp itself and not other factors like nature winds. This is a good point, but the student could have expanded on this idea by discussing how the builders might have considered other factors, such as the potential for wind resistance or the impact of the dirigible's presence on the building's overall stability.

Overall, the student has demonstrated some understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, but could benefit from more developed ideas, clearer connections between paragraphs, and more effective use of specific details from the excerpt.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. They identify three specific challenges: the lack of a suitable landing area, the impact of weather conditions, and the weight of the dirigibles due to the use of hydrogen gas. However, the student could improve their analysis by providing more nuanced and detailed explanations. For instance, they could have explored the potential consequences of the dirigibles' weight on the building's structure and the safety implications of using hydrogen gas. Additionally, the student could have supported their claims with more concrete evidence from the excerpt.

The student's writing is clear and concise, and they effectively use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are some grammatical errors and lack of proper sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer's primary argument is that computers have a profoundly positive impact on society, citing various benefits such as education, communication, and medical advancements. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. For instance, the story of @PERSON2's aunt overcoming cancer with the support of her niece via webcam is a powerful example of the positive effects of technology on personal relationships.

However, the writer's essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, which hinders the overall coherence of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and contain grammatical errors, such as ""a life without computers is utter chaos"" and ""Thats the world we we live in."" Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on first-person pronouns, which can make the essay feel more like a personal essay than a persuasive piece.

The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments, which would have strengthened their argument. For example, they could have discussed the potential negative effects of excessive computer use, such as decreased physical activity and social isolation. Moreover, the writer's use of rhetorical questions, while effective in engaging the reader, can come across as insincere or manipulative.

In conclusion, while the writer presents some compelling arguments, their essay could benefit from a stronger thesis statement, more precise language, and a more nuanced exploration of the topic.

The essay provides a clear and relatable account of a personal experience with patience, albeit with some grammatical and spelling errors. The writer attempts to convey the emotions and sensations they felt while waiting in line for the roller coaster, which is a great way to illustrate the concept of patience. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between sentences and ideas.

One of the notable aspects of the essay is the writer's use of descriptive language, such as ""I would just watch the other people that were having there turn"" and ""we our going so fast."" These phrases demonstrate an attempt to use vivid imagery, but they also contain grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb conjugation.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and length, with some sentences being very short and others being quite long. For example, the sentence ""I take my sun glasses and my dad takes his sunglasses"" is a good example of a simple sentence, but it is not clear what the writer is trying to convey with the phrase ""we our going so fast."" A more effective way to express this idea would be to rephrase it as ""We were going so fast that I couldn't even scream.""

Despite these limitations, the writer's enthusiasm and excitement for the roller coaster experience are evident throughout the essay. The writer's conclusion, ""that is the time I was patience,"" is a good attempt to tie together the various elements of the essay and convey the writer's growth in patience.

The essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the negative effects of excessive computer use. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claim that computers can lead to addiction, social isolation, and decreased physical activity. The use of rhetorical devices such as repetition (""@CAPS4"") and emotive language (""eveybody is being sucked into their computers!"") adds to the persuasive tone of the essay.

However, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and evidence-based arguments. The essay relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions, which may not be convincing to readers who do not share the same experiences. Additionally, the writer could provide more concrete examples and statistics to support their claims about the negative effects of excessive computer use.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more effective organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly between ideas and lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow their argument. The use of slang and informal language (""@CAPS4 addict"") detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

The use of rhetorical devices, such as the quote from Katherine Paterson, effectively conveys the writer's point that censorship is a two-way street, where individual freedom of expression must be balanced with the need to protect vulnerable individuals, particularly children.

One of the strengths of the essay is its accessibility and clarity. The writer's writing style is conversational and easy to understand, making it relatable to a middle school audience. However, there are areas where the writing could improve. The essay relies heavily on abbreviations and informal language, which detract from the overall tone and credibility of the piece.

Furthermore, the writer's argument could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their claims. While they mention that certain materials can be offensive to parents and individuals, they do not provide concrete examples to illustrate this point. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that libraries should categorize materials by age group is a reasonable one, but it does not address the potential consequences of censorship.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. The student relies heavily on simple sentences and lacks varied sentence structures, which makes the writing seem somewhat flat. Additionally, the student's arguments are not always well-supported, with some claims being based on personal opinions rather than concrete evidence. For instance, the student claims that computers are more efficient than libraries, but does not provide any specific data or statistics to back up this assertion.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay and make it more difficult to follow.

Despite these limitations, the student demonstrates a clear passion for the topic and a willingness to engage with the issue. With further refinement and attention to detail, this essay has the potential to be even stronger.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, specifically identifying the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, which hinders the overall coherence and focus of the essay. The student also struggles with sentence structure and organization, resulting in some sentences being unclear and difficult to follow.

The student provides relevant information from the excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen on foreign dirigibles and the violent winds that would affect the docking process. However, the student fails to provide concrete evidence from the excerpt to support their claims, instead relying on general statements. For example, the student states that ""if a foreign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground,"" but does not provide a direct quote or reference from the excerpt to support this claim.

Additionally, the student uses informal language and slang, such as ""Do to"" instead of ""Due to,"" and ""dirgibles"" instead of ""dirigibles."" This detracts from the overall professionalism and clarity of the essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they came back, Saeng vows silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" to convey a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the natural world, which is characterized by the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. The use of these elements creates a sense of cyclical time, suggesting that the story is not just about a single event, but about the passage of time and the promise of new beginnings.

The author's decision to have Saeng vow to take the test again also implies that she has learned from her past experience and is determined to succeed. This is reinforced by the fact that she is thinking about the test in the context of the natural world, which suggests that she is approaching it with a sense of calm and confidence.

The author's conclusion also highlights the theme of perseverance and resilience. Saeng's decision to take the test again, despite the challenges she faced in the past, demonstrates her determination to overcome obstacles and achieve her goals. This is a powerful message for readers, especially for middle school students, who may be facing their own challenges and setbacks.

One area for improvement is that the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the author's use of language and literary devices. The essay relies heavily on summary and paraphrasing, rather than close reading and analysis of the text.

The author's description of their parents' struggles, including their humble beginnings in a one-room apartment and their perseverance in the face of adversity, evokes a strong emotional response from the reader. The use of phrases such as ""he said"" and ""he learned"" creates a sense of intimacy and personal connection, drawing the reader into the author's narrative. The author's admiration for their parents' strength and resilience is palpable, and their emphasis on the importance of family and generosity effectively conveys the value they placed on these qualities.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the author's mood. While the author mentions their parents' struggles, they do not delve deeply into the emotional impact of these experiences on the author's life. Additionally, some of the language is quite simplistic, with phrases such as ""he was really appreciative"" feeling a bit clichéd.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from the author's personal experiences and observations. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, highlighting the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship.

One of the essay's strengths is its ability to provide concrete examples to support the author's argument. The discussion of movies, magazines, and music being censored in libraries is well-organized and easy to follow. The author's concern for children's exposure to potentially disturbing content is understandable, and their suggestion that libraries should only allow age-appropriate materials is a reasonable one.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issue. The author's argument relies heavily on general statements and assumptions about the impact of certain materials on children. For instance, the claim that seeing naked bodies in magazines would ""set a bad example"" for children is not supported by empirical evidence. A more thorough exploration of the topic would have added depth and credibility to the essay.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The writing is often simplistic and lacks transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow at times. The use of abbreviations (e.g., @MONTH1) detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the essay's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The final sentence, ""Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion,"" is unclear and does not effectively reiterate the author's main argument.

The essay provided is a creative and engaging story about patience, but it lacks coherence and organization. The narrative jumps abruptly from the anticipation of a friend's arrival to a chaotic scene where the writer is waiting in the dark. The use of slang and abbreviations (""@CAPS1"", ""@CAPS2"", etc.) detracts from the overall clarity and readability of the essay.

The writer attempts to convey the concept of patience, but the story is more focused on the excitement and anxiety of waiting for a friend. The writer's tone is inconsistent, veering from enthusiasm to terror, which makes it difficult to discern a clear message about patience. The inclusion of phrases like ""I get @CAPS3 I just cant wait!"" and ""I scream in terror"" disrupts the flow of the narrative and undermines the theme of patience.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide a clear example of patience in action. The story does not illustrate what it means to be patient in a meaningful way. Instead, it focuses on the writer's emotional state and the chaos that ensues when they are unable to see their friend.

To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a more cohesive narrative that effectively conveys the concept of patience.

The essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the concept of patience, showcasing the writer's personal experiences and emotions. The writer effectively conveys their impatience in various situations, such as waiting for dinner, a friend's call, and their mom's instructions. However, the essay lacks depth and analysis, relying heavily on simplistic statements and exclamations. The writer's tone is informal and lacks polish, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and lacking in coherence. The writer also fails to provide concrete examples or supporting details to substantiate their claims, making it difficult to fully understand their perspective. Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often fragmented, with short sentences and incomplete thoughts.

One notable aspect of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and express their emotions, which is a crucial aspect of effective writing. However, this is not enough to compensate for the essay's overall lack of structure, organization, and sophistication.

The essay effectively explores the impact of the setting on the cyclist's emotions, although it could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. The writer provides several examples that illustrate the cyclist's feelings of excitement, desperation, and self-pity, which are directly linked to the setting.

Additionally, the description of the hot water hole and the cyclist's reaction to its taste (""tasted like battery acid"") effectively conveys his desperation for water.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. Some sentences are simplistic and lack variety, which makes the writing feel a bit flat. For example, the repetition of the phrase ""he was getting desperate"" becomes monotonous and doesn't add much depth to the analysis.

The essay effectively utilizes personal anecdotes and examples from various books to support their argument, making it relatable and engaging for the reader. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as the quote from Katherine Paterson, adds depth and context to the discussion.

One of the essay's strengths is its ability to address multiple perspectives on the issue of censorship. The writer acknowledges the concerns of parents and conservative groups, but also emphasizes the importance of protecting authors' freedom of speech and the value of exposing readers to diverse viewpoints. The writer's argument is well-supported by examples from various books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' and 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', which demonstrate the complexity of the issue.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. While the writer raises valid points about the importance of protecting authors' freedom of speech, they do not fully consider the potential impact of censorship on vulnerable readers. For instance, some readers may be deeply disturbed by certain themes or content in certain books, and censorship may be necessary to protect them.

Additionally, the writer's tone can be seen as somewhat confrontational, particularly in their criticism of conservative groups. While it is understandable to be passionate about the issue, a more balanced approach might be more effective in engaging readers who may hold differing opinions.

The author effectively uses personal anecdotes and vivid descriptions to illustrate the significance of laughter in their life. The use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors (""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"") and repetition (""@CAPS5 always made me feel..."") adds depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive structure and organization. The author jumps abruptly from discussing the early stages of their relationship to the challenges they faced as a couple, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity and flow of the essay.

The author also relies heavily on the use of abbreviations and acronyms, which can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the context. While the use of these abbreviations is intended to maintain anonymity, it also creates a sense of informality that may not be suitable for a formal essay.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and reflection on the significance of laughter in the author's life. While the author acknowledges the importance of laughter, they do not fully explore its impact on their emotional well-being or the dynamics of their relationship.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong personal narrative voice and a clear passion for the topic, but could benefit from refinement in terms of structure, organization, and analysis.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and the importance of timing. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the natural world, where ""the snows melt and the geese return"" (line 1), indicating a seasonal change. The mention of the ""hibiscus"" also suggests a sense of renewal and growth, as it is a plant that typically blooms in the spring.

The author's decision to wait until the ""spring"" to take the test again is a deliberate choice that highlights the idea that some things are not meant to be rushed. The use of the word ""vowed"" implies a sense of determination and resolve, suggesting that Saeng is committed to learning and growth. The phrase ""when the right time comes"" implies that the author is acknowledging that some things are beyond one's control, and that patience and timing are essential.

Furthermore, the author's conclusion is also a commentary on the human experience. The idea that we often learn lessons that we must wait for the right time to apply is a universal theme that resonates with readers. The author's use of the natural world as a metaphor for human experience adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making the conclusion more impactful and memorable.

The student's essay attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the response lacks specific details and clarity. The student mentions ""extra preshure on the frame of the @CAPS1"" and ""diffuclt docking process,"" but fails to provide concrete examples or explanations to support these claims. The sentence ""high speed winds that made it basicly impossiBle to do"" is also vague and lacks context. The student could have elaborated on how the high winds affected the docking process and what specific challenges this presented for the builders.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as misspellings (""preshure"" instead of ""pressure,"" ""diffuclt"" instead of ""difficult""), and poor sentence structure. The use of all capital letters in ""@CAPS1"" and ""basicly"" is also unconventional and detracts from the overall coherence of the essay.

The essay presents a clear and concise argument in favor of the benefits of computers on individuals. The writer effectively uses three main reasons to support their claim, including the provision of information, enhancement of intelligence, and improvement of hand-eye coordination. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and a lack of supporting evidence. The writer also relies heavily on simplistic language and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from stating the benefits of computers to providing three reasons without a clear introduction or conclusion. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the writer's main argument and follow their reasoning. Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claims, which weakens their argument.

Additionally, the writer's use of language is often simplistic and lacks sophistication. Phrases such as ""it helps you with information"" and ""it helps you become smarter"" are overly simplistic and do not provide any depth or insight into the topic. The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation, with multiple errors throughout the essay.

Despite these issues, the writer does raise some valid points about the benefits of computers, particularly in terms of providing access to information and enhancing intelligence. However, these points are not developed or supported effectively, and the writer fails to address potential counterarguments.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement, providing concrete evidence and examples to support their claims, and using more sophisticated language and grammar. With further development and refinement, the writer has the potential to produce a stronger and more persuasive essay.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis lacks depth and specificity. The student provides some relevant information from the memoir, such as the author's description of the neighborhood as a place where different cultures came together in solidarity and friendship. Nevertheless, the analysis is often general and lacks concrete evidence from the text to support the claims.

For instance, the student mentions that the author created a warm and happy mood, but fails to provide specific examples from the text to substantiate this claim. The student also makes some vague statements, such as ""those are some ways the author created the mood in the story,"" which does not provide any concrete evidence.

To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed analysis of the text. For example, they could analyze a specific passage from the memoir and explain how it contributes to the overall mood. They should also avoid making general statements and instead focus on providing concrete evidence from the text to support their claims.

Additionally, the student could benefit from using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas. The writing is often simplistic and lacks variety, which can make it difficult to follow.

The writer's essay raises an important concern about censorship in libraries, but it lacks depth and coherence. The writer's argument is largely based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence, which, although relatable, does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. The writer's tone is also somewhat simplistic and emotive, with phrases such as ""I belive"" and ""Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health."" These phrases undermine the writer's credibility and detract from the persuasive power of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's suggestions for addressing censorship are not well-thought-out. The idea of censoring books with black markers or blocking certain songs and movies is not a viable solution, as it can be seen as an overreach of authority and can stifle free expression. The writer's suggestion that libraries should follow the example of the old library they used to visit, which censored certain materials, is also problematic, as it implies that censorship is a necessary evil.

The writer could have taken a more nuanced approach to the issue, exploring the complexities of censorship and the importance of intellectual freedom. They could have also provided more evidence from credible sources to support their argument, such as studies on the impact of censorship on children's reading habits or expert opinions on the role of libraries in promoting literacy.

In terms of organization and structure, the essay is disorganized and lacks a clear thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of censoring certain materials to suggesting specific solutions, without providing a clear roadmap for how these solutions would be implemented.

Additionally, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother, and some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student also raises a valid point about the limitations of technology, but this idea is not fully developed. The quote from paragraph @NUM3 is relevant, but it feels like a non-sequitur and could be integrated more smoothly into the rest of the essay. Furthermore, the student could have explored the impact of weather conditions on the feasibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.

This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of Saeng's experience in the United States and her connection to her Vietnamese heritage. The author skillfully weaves together sensory details from the story, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, to create a vivid image of springtime in the United States.

The use of the word ""hibiscus"" is particularly noteworthy, as it serves as a symbol of Saeng's cultural identity and connection to her homeland. The fact that the hibiscus is ""budding"" suggests new beginnings and growth, which is fitting for Saeng's decision to retake the driving test. The author's use of the phrase ""then I will take that test again"" also implies a sense of determination and resilience, highlighting Saeng's ability to persevere in the face of challenges.

Furthermore, the author's decision to conclude the story in the spring, a season often associated with renewal and new beginnings, adds a sense of hope and optimism to the narrative. This choice also serves as a contrast to the difficulties Saeng faced in the United States, emphasizing her desire to find a sense of belonging and connection to her new surroundings.

However, they successfully manage to persevere and complete the task, which ultimately leads to a positive outcome.

The writer's use of simple and concise language is suitable for a middle school level.

This conclusion effectively reinforces the theme of the story, which is the importance of taking a new approach when faced with challenges. The author skillfully uses the imagery of nature to convey the idea of renewal and rejuvenation, as the snows melting and the geese returning signify the end of winter and the beginning of spring. This is further emphasized by the hibiscus, a flower that is often associated with new beginnings and growth.

The author also effectively conveys Saeng's emotional state through her vow, highlighting her determination to retake the test and start anew. The phrase ""I – I failed the test"" suggests that Saeng is not only committed to retaking the test but also acknowledges her past failure, demonstrating a level of self-awareness and humility. This introspection is a crucial aspect of the story, as it shows that Saeng is not only willing to try again but also willing to confront her mistakes.

Furthermore, the author's use of the phrase ""then I will take that test again"" creates a sense of anticipation and hope for the future. This line suggests that Saeng is not giving up, but rather, she is choosing to approach the test with a fresh perspective, which is in line with the story's theme.

The writer's primary argument against censorship in libraries is centered around the idea that books should not be removed from shelves due to their content, as individuals have the right to access and read materials that may be deemed objectionable by others. The writer provides a compelling argument by highlighting the importance of personal freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported thesis statement, and the writer's arguments are often based on personal opinions rather than concrete evidence.

One of the writer's strongest points is the distinction between books and other media, such as movies and music, which are consumed in public spaces and may be more susceptible to exposure to children. The writer's anecdote about the @CAPS3 being left in the car and potentially being played for a child is a creative and effective way to illustrate the potential consequences of censorship. However, this argument is not consistently supported throughout the essay, and the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims.

The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of libraries as a place where children can explore and discover new materials. However, this argument is not fully developed, and the writer does not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support their claim.

The writer's writing style is informal and conversational, which may be suitable for a middle school audience. However, the lack of clarity and coherence in the writing makes it difficult to follow the writer's argument.

The writer's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom of choice and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the writer's argument is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns is the writer's assertion that parents should control what their children read. While this statement may seem reasonable, it oversimplifies the issue of censorship and ignores the fact that many parents may not have the time, resources, or expertise to make informed decisions about their children's reading material. Furthermore, the writer's suggestion that parents should simply ""pick out a new book"" if they find something objectionable is not a viable solution, as it does not address the root issue of censorship and the potential harm it can cause to readers.

The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of exposing children to diverse perspectives and cultures. However, this point is not fully developed and is often lost amidst the writer's rambling and lack of organization. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that certain books or materials should be removed from the shelves due to their content is not supported by any concrete evidence or logical reasoning.

The writer's tone is also problematic, as it often veers into condescension and defensiveness. The statement ""If you don't like it, find something else"" comes across as dismissive and unhelpful, while the suggestion that parents should be responsible for monitoring their children's media consumption is overly simplistic and unrealistic.

In terms of organization and coherence, the essay is disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of diversity to suggesting that certain books should be removed from the shelves, without providing any clear connection between the two ideas.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid points about the importance of individual freedom of choice and the potential consequences of censorship, their essay is marred by numerous errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to create a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and the cyclical nature of life, as evident in the story. The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, emphasizing the idea that with the changing of the seasons, new opportunities will arise.

The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow in the spring, a time of renewal and growth, suggests that she is willing to take another chance and face her fears. This conclusion also leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation, wondering what will happen when Saeng takes the test again. The author's use of the word ""vowed"" implies a sense of determination and commitment, which reinforces the idea that Saeng is ready to face her challenges head-on.

Furthermore, the author's conclusion effectively avoids providing a clear resolution to the story, leaving the reader with a sense of uncertainty, which is a common technique used in literature to keep readers engaged and invested in the story. This technique is particularly effective in this story, as it allows the reader to reflect on the themes and ideas presented throughout the narrative.

Overall, the author's conclusion is a masterful way to wrap up the story, leaving the reader with a lasting impression and a sense of hope for Saeng's future.

The writer presents a clear and passionate stance against censorship in libraries, arguing that it infringes upon individual freedom and limits education. The essay effectively utilizes personal anecdotes, such as the example of the book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1,' to illustrate the importance of preserving diverse perspectives and historical context. The writer also raises a valid point about the subjective nature of censorship, emphasizing that it is ultimately up to parents to decide what materials their children are exposed to.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer relies heavily on emotional appeals, such as ""I very resent"" and ""I agree with the latter statement,"" which detract from the overall credibility of the essay. Additionally, the writer's use of all-caps and abbreviations (e.g., '@CAPS1') detracts from the formal tone and clarity of the writing.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored more complex and nuanced perspectives on censorship. For instance, they could have discussed the potential benefits of censorship, such as protecting vulnerable readers from explicit content, or the importance of considering the context in which a work is presented. By acknowledging these counterarguments, the writer could have strengthened their position and demonstrated a more mature understanding of the issue.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more sophisticated writing and a more nuanced exploration of the complexities of censorship.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks specific details and supporting evidence from the excerpt to substantiate the claim. The student mentions that the problems with mooring air ships to fixed masts at such a height made it desirable to postpone the installation of the landing gear, but this statement is not supported by any direct quotes or specific information from the excerpt.

To improve the essay, the student should have provided more concrete evidence from the excerpt to support their argument. For instance, they could have mentioned the challenges of maintaining structural integrity, the difficulties of anchoring the dirigibles, or the impact of wind and weather conditions on the docking process. By incorporating more specific details from the excerpt, the essay would have been more convincing and effective in conveying the obstacles faced by the builders.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the challenges. For example, the student could have explored the technical difficulties of mooring dirigibles at such a height, the impact on the building's structural design, or the potential consequences of delaying the installation of the landing gear.

The writer effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition (""why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping?"") and emotive language (""our people,"" ""our teens,"" ""our communication skills"") to engage the reader and emphasize their point. However, the writer's tone often veers into personal opinions and biases, which detract from the persuasive power of their argument.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on anecdotal evidence, such as their personal observations of their friends using slang terms, to make sweeping statements about the effects of computers on society. While this may be a relatable and engaging way to present their argument, it is not a reliable method for making a persuasive case. The writer would benefit from incorporating more credible sources and data to support their claims.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""definetley"" instead of ""definitely"" and ""I understant"" instead of ""I understand."" These errors detract from the writer's credibility and undermine their argument.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph, skillfully tying together the themes of perseverance and the symbolism of the hibiscus. The connection between the plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions and Saeng's determination to overcome obstacles is well-established through the quote ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here… that is what matters."" This quote not only highlights the hibiscus's resilience but also serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own perseverance. The author's decision to wait until spring to take the test again provides a sense of closure to the conflict, implying that Saeng is willing to endure the challenges she faces and that her determination will ultimately lead to success.

The use of the hibiscus as a symbol of perseverance is also reinforced by the author's mention of the plant's ability to ""budding"" in the spring, suggesting that new life and growth are possible even in difficult times. This imagery effectively conveys Saeng's hope and optimism for the future, underscoring the idea that her perseverance will ultimately lead to positive outcomes.

The writer's argument against censorship in libraries is well-structured and effectively conveys their perspective on the importance of diverse perspectives and opinions in literature. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson serves as a thought-provoking introduction to the topic, highlighting the idea that everyone has the right to express their opinions, even if they disagree with others.

The writer's main argument is that libraries should not remove books from shelves due to individual opinions, as this would limit the exposure of diverse perspectives and stifle free expression. They correctly point out that books are meant to be enjoyed by many people, and that it is the responsibility of the reader to decide whether or not to read a particular book. The writer also emphasizes the importance of discussing and debating different opinions, which is a crucial aspect of a healthy and functioning society.

However, the writer's argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. For instance, they could discuss specific instances where censorship has led to the suppression of important ideas or perspectives, and how this has impacted society. Additionally, they could explore the potential consequences of censorship on the development of critical thinking and intellectual freedom.

The author's use of the phrase ""When they come back"" suggests that Saeng is waiting for a specific event or occasion, which is the melting of the snow and the return of the geese, to take the test again. This event is not just a random occurrence, but rather a symbolic moment that marks the beginning of a new season, and by extension, a new chance for Saeng to succeed.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, with the writer expressing both sides of the argument. However, the writing quality is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support the writer's claims.

One of the primary concerns is the writer's inability to articulate a clear thesis statement, which is essential for a persuasive essay. The writer jumps between different ideas and opinions without providing a clear direction or focus. For instance, the writer states ""I'm for it and against it"" without explaining what they mean by these phrases. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to understand the writer's stance on the topic.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on personal opinions and anecdotes, which, while relatable, do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The writer's assertion that ""everyone likes different things"" and ""we all have to get over it"" is a vague statement that does not address the complexities of censorship. The writer also fails to consider alternative perspectives, such as the importance of freedom of expression and the role of libraries in promoting intellectual diversity.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is characterized by grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (""ciggerettes"" instead of ""cigarettes""), lack of punctuation, and inconsistent verb tenses. These errors detract from the writer's credibility and make it difficult to take their arguments seriously.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas and paragraphs that seem to be randomly arranged. The writer jumps between different topics, such as music and tobacco products, without providing a clear connection to the main topic of censorship in libraries.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid points about the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship, their essay falls short in terms of writing quality, coherence, and evidence-based arguments.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation, relying heavily on personal opinions rather than providing a well-reasoned and evidence-based stance.

One of the significant issues with the essay is its lack of clarity and organization. The writing is often simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of transitional phrases, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. The text also suffers from grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing.

The student effectively uses personal opinions and observations to support their position, acknowledging the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address the issue from a relatable perspective. The student's mention of their own generation's preferences for certain types of media, such as music and movies, adds a personal touch and helps to illustrate the point that censorship can be seen as restrictive. The student also raises a valid concern about the potential impact on libraries, suggesting that removing certain materials could lead to a decrease in business.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The student's reasoning is often based on a simplistic ""if you don't like it, don't look for it"" approach, which may not fully address the complexities of the issue. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more concrete examples and evidence to support the student's claims. For instance, the student could have explored the impact of censorship on free speech, the role of libraries in promoting intellectual freedom, or the potential consequences of self-censorship.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more effective organization and transitions. The writing is often disjointed, with ideas and sentences feeling disconnected from one another. The student could have used more cohesive transitions to link their ideas and create a more logical flow of argument.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship, it could benefit from more sophisticated arguments, concrete evidence, and improved organization.

The essay provides a clear and sincere expression of the author's gratitude towards their family and the efforts of their parents. However, the writing lacks depth and specificity in supporting the claim. The phrase ""thankfull"" should be spelled as ""thankful,"" and the sentence structure is quite simple, with no clear transitions between ideas. The author could benefit from providing more concrete examples or anecdotes to illustrate the impact of their parents' actions on their life.

Additionally, the sentence ""also for all the things his parents have done to give him a good education and a home so he could have everything he needs"" feels like a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow of the paragraph. It would be more effective to integrate this idea more smoothly into the previous sentence or as a separate paragraph.

To improve, the author should focus on providing more specific examples and anecdotes to support their claims, and work on varying sentence structure to create a more dynamic and engaging writing style.

The essay presents a clear and passionate stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, with the writer arguing that individuals should have the freedom to choose what materials they want to read or watch. The writer's use of personal anecdotes and examples effectively conveys their point, making the essay more relatable and engaging.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the opposing viewpoint, as seen in the writer's statement that ""You @CAPS1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them."" This shows that the writer has considered multiple perspectives and is not simply advocating for censorship without acknowledging potential counterarguments.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer's reliance on simplistic statements, such as ""Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from,"" comes across as overly dramatic and lacks concrete evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that parents should be the sole arbiters of what materials are suitable for children is not universally applicable and may not account for diverse family structures and values.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can be perceived as confrontational and dismissive of opposing viewpoints, with phrases such as ""You @CAPS1 @CAPS2 don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies, libraries, or book stores."" This tone may deter readers from engaging with the writer's argument and considering alternative perspectives.

In terms of organization and coherence, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of individual freedom to advocating for separate sections for objectionable materials in libraries. A more logical flow of ideas and clearer transitions between paragraphs would improve the essay's overall clarity and effectiveness.

Overall, while the essay presents a clear and passionate argument, it could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments, as well as a more balanced and respectful tone.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to symbolize the cyclical nature of life and the protagonist's determination to overcome challenges. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and renewal, as the author highlights the connection between the changing seasons and the protagonist's resolve to retake the test.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the ""snows melt"" and ""hibiscus is budding,"" creates a vivid image of the natural world and emphasizes the passing of time. This imagery also serves to underscore the idea that the story is coming to a close, as the snows are melting and the seasons are changing. The mention of the geese returning also adds a sense of hope and renewal, suggesting that the protagonist is looking forward to a brighter future.

Furthermore, the protagonist's vow to retake the test in the spring, when the conditions are more favorable, demonstrates her determination and resilience. This conclusion also leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation and hope, as the protagonist is willing to face her challenges again in the future.

The student's essay attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, which hinders the overall coherence of the essay. The student provides some relevant information about the challenges of modifying the steel frame to accommodate the mast, but the explanation is brief and lacks specific details. Furthermore, the student incorrectly states that the builders couldn't drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof due to the wind causing stress to the frame; in reality, the issue was that the dirigibles would have hung from the mast, not the roof.

Additionally, the student's writing lacks proper sentence structure and grammar, with several sentences containing grammatical errors, such as ""The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two."" The student also fails to provide any supporting evidence or examples from the excerpt to substantiate their claims.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The student acknowledges the importance of individual opinions and the potential for differing tastes in media. However, the essay lacks a clear and well-supported argument, relying heavily on simplistic statements and colloquial expressions. The use of abbreviations, such as ""@MONTH1"" and ""mmay,"" detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing.

Moreover, the student's argument is not well-organized, and the transitions between ideas are abrupt. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing books to magazines without a clear connection between the two topics. The student's tone is also inconsistent, veering from a casual, conversational tone to a more forceful, imperative tone (""come on now"").

To strengthen the essay, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they could have discussed a particular book or magazine that they believe should be censored and explained why. Additionally, they could have explored the potential consequences of censorship on free speech and the importance of exposing students to diverse perspectives.

Furthermore, the student could have used more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas. The use of phrases such as ""I'm saying"" and ""there should be certain things"" is not only informal but also lacks clarity.

In conclusion, while the essay raises some valid points about the importance of individual opinions and the potential for differing tastes in media, it requires significant improvement in terms of organization, clarity, and argumentation.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student identifies three instances of graciousness in the memoir, which effectively convey the author's appreciation for his parents' love, sacrifices, and the values they instilled in him. The student provides specific quotes from the memoir to support their analysis, demonstrating a good understanding of the text.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. The student's language is simple and lacks depth, which may indicate a lack of critical thinking skills.

The writer relies heavily on simplistic statements and clichés, such as ""people are getting offended more easily these days"" and ""it's all in how you take it."" These statements do not provide substantial evidence to support their claim and come across as dismissive of the complexities of the issue.

Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments and consider alternative perspectives. For instance, they do not acknowledge the potential harm that certain content can cause, particularly to vulnerable individuals such as children. They also do not provide concrete examples of censorship in libraries or media that they believe are unjust or unnecessary.

The writer presents a well-structured and persuasive argument against censorship in libraries, effectively using personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their stance. The use of rhetorical questions and rhetorical devices, such as allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, adds depth and emotional resonance to the essay. The writer's tone is conversational and relatable, making it easy for the reader to engage with their perspective.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance personal experience with logical reasoning.

The writer also effectively counters the potential argument that censorship is necessary to protect children from mature themes by pointing out that many of these themes still exist in popular media today.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the topic. At times, the writer relies on simplistic binary oppositions (e.g., ""good vs. bad"" or ""allowed vs. forbidden"") that do not fully capture the complexity of the issue. Additionally, the writer could have explored more theoretical perspectives on censorship, such as the First Amendment rights of authors and creators, or the potential impact of censorship on artistic expression.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be strengthened by a more explicit summary of the main points and a reiteration of the thesis statement. The final sentence, ""My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see,"" feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay and could be rephrased for greater clarity.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong foundation for a persuasive argument against censorship, but could benefit from further refinement and development to make it more convincing and nuanced.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the hot and arid environment, stating that the area is ""desert-like"" and that there is ""sand everywhere."" This helps the reader visualize the setting and understand its impact on the cyclist. The writer also provides specific details, such as the temperature of the water and Lodi, which adds to the overall description.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis and depth in its explanation. The writer simply states that the cyclist gets dehydrated due to the heat, but does not elaborate on how the setting contributes to this outcome. Additionally, the writer could have explored the emotional or psychological impact of the setting on the cyclist, which would add more complexity to the essay.

One area for improvement is in the organization and coherence of the essay. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the setting to stating the cyclist's goal and its effect. A more logical flow of ideas would enhance the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

The writer's essay presents a clear and passionate stance against censorship in libraries, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom of choice and the potential consequences of removing books from shelves. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and relatable examples to illustrate their point, making the argument more engaging and accessible to the reader.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the potential concerns about certain books being objectionable, but to counter these concerns with a nuanced understanding of the value of diverse perspectives and the importance of personal expression. The writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""How would you feel if that was to happen to you?"" and ""You should look at all the positive way first,"" encourages the reader to consider multiple viewpoints and empathize with the writers who create and read these books.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated organization and transitions between paragraphs. At times, the writing feels disjointed, and the ideas could be more clearly connected. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""Most people would want to remove the stories with bad lauguage or vocabulary off the shelevs"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their argument. While they mention that books can be a way for people to escape the real world and learn how to deal with things in a better way, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to illustrate this point.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of individual freedom of choice and the potential consequences of censorship. With further refinement in organization, clarity, and evidence-based support, their argument could be even more compelling.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging story about the importance of laughter in relationships, effectively conveying the author's perspective on the topic. The narrative is well-structured, and the use of sensory details, such as the car ride and the candy hearts, helps to create a vivid atmosphere. The author's voice shines through in the writing, making the story feel personal and authentic.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance humor and heart. The author skillfully weaves in comedic moments, such as the foot and back rubs, with more sentimental moments, like the exchange of phone numbers and the realization that love is the true cause of laughter. This balance adds depth to the narrative and makes it more engaging for the reader.

However, there are areas where the writing could improve. The essay relies heavily on first-person narration, which, while effective in conveying the author's voice, can make the story feel somewhat self-centered. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the writing.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. Phrases like ""something in us changed that we could be a little closer"" and ""I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown"" feel a bit clichéd and could be rephrased for more impact.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively conveys the author's perspective. With some refinement in terms of sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary, the writing could be even more effective in engaging the reader and making the argument more compelling.

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of patience, highlighting its importance in various situations. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of supporting evidence. The student's writing style is simplistic, and the use of clichéd phrases such as ""waiting for a blood test"" and ""you might hurt someone"" does not add much depth to the discussion.

The student also fails to provide concrete examples to illustrate the concept of patience, instead relying on vague statements. For instance, the comparison between waiting for a blood test and waiting in the army is not a strong connection, as the two situations are vastly different in terms of context and significance.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks organization and clarity. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of patience to making a statement about the army, which seems unrelated to the main topic.

The writer's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from their personal experience and observations. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the writer's argument is largely based on a simplistic and binary view of the issue, where they advocate for the removal of all objectionable materials from libraries and public spaces.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their argument. The mention of children sharing and imitating negative behaviors is a common concern for many parents, and the writer effectively conveys this worry. Additionally, the writer's emphasis on the importance of protecting children from negative influences is a valid point, as exposure to mature content can have a lasting impact on their development.

However, the writer's approach to censorship is overly broad and lacks nuance. They suggest that all objectionable materials should be removed from libraries, which is an unrealistic and potentially counterproductive solution. This approach ignores the value of diverse perspectives and the importance of exposing children to a wide range of ideas and viewpoints. Furthermore, it fails to consider the role of parents and guardians in making informed decisions about the content their children are exposed to.

The writer also relies heavily on emotional appeals, using phrases such as ""it will be a better world if we do"" and ""we need to stop complaining."" While these sentiments are understandable, they do not provide a compelling argument for censorship. A more effective approach would involve presenting evidence-based research and expert opinions to support the writer's claims.

In terms of organization and style, the essay is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks cohesion and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of protecting children from negative influences to advocating for the removal of all objectionable materials. A more effective structure would involve a clearer introduction, body, and conclusion that build on each other.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid concerns about the impact of negative content on children, their approach to censorship is overly simplistic and lacks nuance. With further development of their argument and a more nuanced approach, the writer could present a more compelling case for censorship in libraries.

The essay provided lacks a clear and coherent explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer seems to focus more on the cyclist's personal feelings and emotions, rather than analyzing the impact of the setting on the cyclist's experience. For instance, the phrase ""The cyclist thought it was hard"" is a subjective statement that does not provide any insight into how the setting contributes to the cyclist's difficulty. 

To develop a more comprehensive analysis, the writer could have explored how the setting, such as the terrain, weather, or road conditions, affects the cyclist's physical and mental state. For example, the writer could have discussed how the steep incline or uneven road surface makes it harder for the cyclist to maintain their pace or how the lack of shade or shelter affects their physical comfort.

Furthermore, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting, which would have helped to create a more immersive experience for the reader. For instance, instead of simply stating that the old timers gave bad directions, the writer could have described the specific actions or words used by the old timers that made the directions unclear or confusing.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to convey her deep emotional connection with the hibiscus plant. This conclusion is supported by the author's previous descriptions of the hibiscus, which showcase her affection and appreciation for the plant. For instance, she describes the hibiscus as having a ""smooth and cool"" texture, and its scent as a ""sweet scent"" (@CAPS1). These sensory details demonstrate the author's positive feelings towards the hibiscus, making it clear that she values the plant beyond its mere physical characteristics.

Moreover, the author's decision to take the test again in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, suggests that she associates these natural events with the hibiscus's blooming. This implies that the hibiscus is not just a plant, but a symbol of hope and renewal for the author. The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of determination and commitment, emphasizing the author's resolve to take the test again.

The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their position, such as their own experience with a favorite book that they believe should not be removed due to its content.

However, the writer's argument is not without its flaws. The text often relies on simplistic and binary thinking, with the writer presenting a clear ""us versus them"" dichotomy between those who want to remove offensive books and those who want to keep them. This approach oversimplifies the complexities of the issue and fails to acknowledge the potential harm that some books may cause to certain individuals or groups.

The writer effectively analyzes the cyclist's reactions to the different elements of the setting, such as the mule and the broken-down juice factory, to demonstrate how these features impact his mental state and survival prospects. However, the analysis could be more nuanced and detailed, as the writer relies heavily on surface-level observations rather than exploring the deeper implications of the setting on the cyclist's emotions and thoughts. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the overall writing quality.

The author effectively creates a mood of transformation and appreciation in the memoir, shifting from a somber tone at the beginning to a more positive and grateful one. The author skillfully highlights the ways in which Narciso's life is enriched by her Cuban heritage, as evident in her expression of gratitude towards her parents. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso explicitly states that she is thankful for her parents' selflessness and caring nature, which is a significant aspect of her Cuban culture. This sentiment is further reinforced by her mention of her mom turning a simple place into a home, showcasing the love and effort she puts into creating a warm and welcoming environment.

However, the author could benefit from more nuanced and detailed descriptions to further develop the mood and atmosphere of the memoir. At times, the text feels somewhat simplistic, and additional sensory details would help to create a more immersive experience for the reader. Nevertheless, the author demonstrates a clear ability to convey the importance of family and cultural heritage in shaping one's identity and outlook on life.

The essay effectively conveys the author's joyful mood in the memoir, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its expression. The author attempts to describe the mood by referencing specific details, such as the author's gratitude towards their parents and the presence of passionate Cuban music. However, the transitions between sentences are abrupt, and the writing lacks cohesion. The author also uses informal language, such as ""exernally"" and ""lighthened up a  little,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The author provides some relevant and specific information from the memoir, but it is not always clear how these details support the claim about the mood. For example, the author mentions that the author's parents shared cooking duties, but it is not explicitly stated how this contributes to the joyful mood. Additionally, the phrase ""all of this stuff"" is vague and does not provide any concrete evidence to support the author's argument.

To improve the essay, the author should focus on providing more specific and detailed examples that illustrate the joyful mood. They should also work on improving sentence structure and transitions to create a more cohesive and clear narrative.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and depth in its analysis. The student provides some relevant information, such as the law banning low-flying aircrafts in urban areas and the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled blimps, but these points are not fully developed or supported with concrete evidence.

One of the main issues with the essay is the use of vague language and simplistic sentence structures. Phrases such as ""quite a few obstacles"" and ""very likely"" do not provide a clear understanding of the challenges faced by the builders. Additionally, the student fails to provide specific examples or quotes from the excerpt to support their claims.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement that ties together the various points discussed. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the law banning low-flying aircrafts to the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled blimps, without providing a clear connection between the two.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses specific examples and evidence to support their claims, such as the negative effects of excessive computer use on physical health (obesity, eye strain) and mental health (cyberbullying). The writer also provides personal anecdotes and statistics to emphasize the severity of the issue.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and balanced analysis. The writer relies heavily on negative examples and fails to provide sufficient counterarguments to support their claims. For instance, they do not address the potential benefits of computers in education, social connections, or economic opportunities. Additionally, some sentences are simplistic and lack clarity, such as ""People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health."" A more sophisticated writing style and more detailed explanations would strengthen the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can be perceived as overly dramatic and emotive, with phrases such as ""devastating outcome,"" ""one way ticket to getting cyber bullied,"" and ""horrid machines."" While it is understandable to be concerned about the negative effects of computers, a more measured approach would be more effective in persuading readers.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some compelling evidence, but could benefit from more balanced analysis, clearer writing, and a more nuanced tone.

The student's essay presents a clear opinion on the effects of computers on people, but it lacks coherence, organization, and effective use of evidence to support their argument. The writer's tone is informal and often uses slang, which detracts from the persuasive nature of the letter. The essay also fails to address counterarguments and provide concrete examples to strengthen their stance.

One of the primary issues with the essay is its lack of clear structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to the negative effects of taking them away, without providing a logical connection between the two ideas. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""it's good to do homework on"" and ""we get enough of that in school."" These statements do not provide any concrete evidence to support their argument and come across as unconvincing.

The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments. For example, they mention that people might be spending too much time on computers, but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim or offer alternative solutions to mitigate this issue.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay contains several errors, including misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent punctuation. For instance, the writer uses ""lof"" instead of ""a lot,"" ""comptuer"" instead of ""computer,"" and ""you guy"" instead of ""you guys.""

Overall, while the writer expresses a clear opinion on the effects of computers, their essay lacks the organization, evidence, and persuasive techniques necessary to convince readers of their argument.

The essay provides a clear attempt to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir, supported by specific points from the text. However, the analysis lacks depth and coherence. The student's use of transitional phrases and sentence structure is simplistic, and the connections between ideas are not well-established. The student also struggles with sentence-level grammar and punctuation, evident in the use of parentheses to separate ideas, which can be confusing and disrupt the flow of the essay.

Moreover, the student's analysis of the mood is limited to identifying a few specific instances of gratefulness and perspective, without providing a broader context or explanation of how these elements contribute to the overall mood. The student's writing also lacks nuance and sophistication, relying on simplistic phrases such as ""ultamately"" and ""here is my reason why.""

To improve, the student should focus on developing a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the text, using more sophisticated sentence structures and transitional phrases to connect ideas.

The writer's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. The writer's personal experiences and observations are woven throughout the essay, making the argument more engaging and authentic.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the existence of offensive materials in libraries while also highlighting the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. The writer's argument that people should be able to access materials that might be considered offensive, but not necessarily be forced to confront them, is a compelling one. The writer's personal anecdotes, such as the experience of waiting for over an hour to access a computer, effectively illustrate the value of physical books and the limitations of relying solely on digital resources.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issue. The writer's argument that libraries should not remove materials simply because they are offensive is not entirely convincing, as it neglects to consider the potential harm that such materials could cause to vulnerable readers. Additionally, the writer's assertion that people can simply ignore or report offensive materials is overly simplistic and does not address the complexities of censorship.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of individual freedom to describing a personal experience, and the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking between ideas.

The author effectively conveys a sense of gratitude and appreciation in the memoir, creating a warm and sentimental mood.

The author also effectively utilizes sensory details, like the Cuban food and music, to create a vivid atmosphere that immerses the reader in Narciso's childhood experiences.

However, the writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing Narciso's upbringing to expressing his gratitude, and the connections between the two ideas could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual,"" feel somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the author could benefit from more nuanced and varied sentence structures. The essay is heavy on simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the setting affects the cyclist, but it lacks depth and analysis. The writer attempts to support their claim with specific quotes from the essay, but the connections between the quotes and the overall argument are not thoroughly explored. For instance, the quote ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips"" effectively conveys the cyclist's dehydration, but the writer could have elaborated on how this affects the cyclist's physical and mental state. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the setting, such as the environment, weather conditions, and time of day, to better illustrate the impact of the setting on the cyclist.

Furthermore, the writer could have used more nuanced language to describe the setting and its effects on the cyclist. The phrase ""Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt"" is a good start, but it could be more vivid and descriptive. The writer could have also explored the emotional and psychological impact of the setting on the cyclist, such as feelings of fear, anxiety, or desperation.

The writer's essay presents a clear and well-organized argument on the benefits of computers in society. The writer effectively uses various points to support their claim, such as the ability of computers to provide access to new places and people, facilitate social networking, and streamline planning and research processes. However, the writer's argument is not entirely convincing, as they fail to provide concrete evidence to support their claims and often rely on vague statements and clichés.

One of the major issues with the essay is the writer's lack of clarity and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to making a general statement about the importance of ""the room for improvement."" This lack of cohesion makes it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the writer's use of simplistic language and grammatical errors detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's counterargument is weak and lacks depth. While they acknowledge the concerns of experts about people spending too much time on computers, they fail to provide a convincing response. The writer's statement that ""people are new places or people, social networking is more advanced, and time that could have been spent planning is now living"" is vague and does not address the concerns of experts.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction and conclusion.

The student effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas and provide evidence to support their claims. However, the writing lacks coherence and clarity in some places, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall impact of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their claims.

The writer presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, citing personal freedom and the potential consequences of removing materials deemed offensive. The essay effectively uses real-life examples, such as profanity in music and derogatory language in literature, to support the claim that censorship can be overly broad and restrictive. The writer also raises a valid point about the importance of allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they read or listen to.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issue. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that certain materials should be removed if they can cause problems, but fail to provide specific examples or explain how such removal would effectively prevent harm.

The author skillfully weaves in sensory details, such as the ""hibiscus"" and the ""snow,"" to create a vivid image of the setting. The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys Saeng's determination and resolve, emphasizing her commitment to retaking the test.

The author's conclusion is also notable for its subtlety. Rather than providing a dramatic or conclusive statement, the paragraph presents a quiet, introspective moment of reflection. This approach allows the reader to infer Saeng's emotions and thoughts, making the conclusion more relatable and engaging. Furthermore, the use of the phrase ""then I will take that test again"" creates a sense of circularity, suggesting that Saeng's journey is ongoing and that she is not giving up.

Moreover, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention online resources for exercise and dieting, they do not provide specific examples or statistics to back up these assertions. This lack of evidence may undermine the writer's credibility and make their argument less convincing.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more sophisticated language, varied sentence structures, and concrete evidence to support the writer's claims.

The essay presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, effectively addressing the concerns of both children and adults. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios to illustrate their point, making the argument more relatable and engaging. The writer also provides concrete alternatives to censorship, such as separate sections for adults and age-restricted materials, which demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the issue.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance the need for protecting children from explicit content with the importance of preserving free speech. The writer acknowledges that some materials may be deemed offensive, but argues that removal from shelves is not the solution. Instead, they propose alternative solutions that allow for age-restricted access while still maintaining the freedom of expression.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. For example, the writer mentions the importance of the First Amendment, but does not delve deeper into the implications of censorship on artistic expression and intellectual freedom. Additionally, some of the proposed solutions, such as separate buildings for age-restricted materials, may be impractical or unfeasible.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention Katherine Paterson's quote, they do not engage with her argument or provide any additional context. Incorporating more scholarly sources or expert opinions would strengthen the essay's argument and demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.

The author skillfully weaves together the symbolism of the hibiscus plant, which serves as a connection between Saeng's past and present, to illustrate her transformation. The use of sensory details, such as the ""familiar fragrance"" and the image of the geese returning, creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the passing of time.

The author's decision to conclude the story with this paragraph also highlights Saeng's newfound resilience and determination. The phrase ""I will take that test again"" suggests that Saeng has come to terms with her past and is now ready to face new challenges. This conclusion is a testament to the author's ability to craft a narrative that explores themes of identity, adaptation, and personal growth.

Furthermore, the author's use of the hibiscus plant as a symbol of hope and renewal is a powerful tool in conveying Saeng's emotional journey. The fact that the plant is mentioned in the context of the story's conclusion, rather than its introduction, emphasizes the significance of this symbol in Saeng's personal growth. The author's skillful use of the hibiscus plant as a narrative device adds depth and complexity to the story, making the conclusion all the more impactful.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, echoing the sentiments of Katherine Paterson's quote. The writer effectively conveys their opposition to removing books from library shelves due to their content, emphasizing the importance of access to diverse literature for learning and personal growth.

However, the essay lacks a clear and structured argument. The writer jumps between ideas, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The writing style is informal, with grammatical errors and lack of proper punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""books are a very important learning tool in todays schools and there is somthing new in every book that a kid can learn from"" should be rewritten as ""books are a very important learning tool in today's schools, and there is something new in every book that a kid can learn from.""

Moreover, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments to their position. They do not consider the possibility that some books may contain content that is genuinely harmful or offensive, and that removing such books from libraries could be a necessary measure to protect students. The writer also does not provide concrete examples of books that they believe should be kept in libraries, which would strengthen their argument.

Additionally, the writer's tone is somewhat inconsistent, veering between persuasive and confrontational. While they effectively use rhetorical questions to engage the reader, they also make accusatory statements, such as ""if you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opportunity you shouldn't do it."" This tone can be off-putting and may deter the reader from considering the writer's perspective.

In conclusion, while the essay raises an important point about the importance of access to diverse literature, it requires more development and refinement to make a compelling argument. With more attention to structure, grammar, and addressing potential counterarguments, the writer could strengthen their position and make a more convincing case for keeping books in libraries.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the student's unique perspective on laughter. The use of self-deprecation and humor adds a layer of authenticity to the narrative, making it more enjoyable to read. However, there are areas where the essay could be improved.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the importance of protecting children from explicit content in books.

The author attempts to convey a sense of happiness and contentment in their memoir, suggesting that they have improved their living situation compared to their past in Cuba. However, the writing lacks clarity and coherence, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, the phrase ""he relizes"" should be spelled as ""he realizes,"" and the sentence structure is simplistic. The author also uses the phrase ""he would of,"" which is a grammatically incorrect contraction of ""he would have."" Furthermore, the transition between the two sentences feels abrupt, as the author jumps from discussing their current living situation to describing their past without clear connection. The author could have strengthened their argument by providing more context or elaborating on the differences between their current and past living situations.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses various points to support their claim, including the educational value, communication tools, and practical applications of computers. The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect their ideas and create a cohesive narrative.

However, the essay could benefit from several areas of improvement. Firstly, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of abbreviations, misspellings, and grammatical errors detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the writer uses ""forien"" instead of ""foreign,"" ""intouch"" instead of ""in touch,"" and ""definately"" instead of ""definitely."" Additionally, the writer's sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, leading to repetitive and monotonous reading.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention the benefits of computers, they do not offer specific examples or statistics to back up their assertions. This lack of evidence makes their argument less convincing and less persuasive.

The writer also relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people"" and ""computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world."" These statements are overly broad and do not provide any unique insights or perspectives.

Finally, the writer's tone is often overly enthusiastic and lacks nuance. While it is understandable to be excited about the benefits of computers, the writer's tone comes across as insincere and lacking in depth.

Overall, while the essay presents a clear argument, it requires significant improvement in terms of writing quality, evidence, and tone.

The essay provides a clear and relatable explanation of the concept of patience, highlighting its benefits and importance in everyday life. The writer effectively uses concrete examples, such as waiting in a line for a roller-coaster, to illustrate the concept of patience. However, the essay lacks depth and analysis, relying on simplistic statements and generalizations.

The writer's writing style is straightforward and easy to understand, but it lacks variety and sophistication. The use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is minimal, making the essay feel disjointed and lacking in cohesion. The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, with several errors throughout the essay.

One area for improvement is the writer's ability to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While the writer mentions that having patience can help you succeed in life, they fail to provide specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate this point. Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

To take the essay to the next level, the writer should focus on providing more nuanced and detailed explanations, using a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary to add depth and complexity. They should also strive to improve their grammar, punctuation, and spelling skills to ensure that the writing is error-free.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers. The writer effectively uses specific examples from their personal experience, such as using computers for research and projects, to support their claim. The inclusion of examples like using photoshop for art and accessing information on websites like facebook and @CAPS2.com demonstrates the versatility and usefulness of computers in various aspects of life.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and balanced analysis. The writer primarily focuses on the benefits of computers without adequately addressing the concerns of those who argue that excessive computer use can lead to negative consequences, such as decreased physical activity and social isolation. A more comprehensive evaluation would have considered multiple perspectives and weighed the pros and cons of computer use.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and personal growth that are woven throughout the narrative. The author's decision to set the vow for the spring, a season associated with new beginnings and growth, suggests that she is looking forward to a fresh start and a chance to redeem herself.

The mention of the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding creates a vivid image of a natural world that is slowly coming back to life. This imagery serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own personal growth and renewal. The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snow and the blooming hibiscus, effectively immerses the reader in the story and reinforces the idea that spring is a time of new beginnings.

Furthermore, the author's vow to take the test again is a clear indication that she is taking responsibility for her actions and is committed to learning and improvement. The fact that she is making this vow silently, rather than out loud, suggests that she is reflecting on her past mistakes and is determined to do better in the future.

The student has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction could be improved by providing more context and background information about the Empire State Building and the concept of dirigibles.

The student has provided some relevant information about the challenges of docking dirigibles, such as the stress on the building's framework and the cost of modifications. However, these points are not fully developed and lack supporting evidence from the excerpt. The student could have used quotes or specific details from the excerpt to strengthen their arguments.

The student has also made some incorrect assumptions about the situation, such as stating that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas was the primary reason for abandoning the idea. While this is a plausible argument, it is not supported by the excerpt. The excerpt only mentions that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, but it does not explicitly state that this was the reason for abandoning the idea.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, effectively evokes a sense of renewal and hope, which is in stark contrast to the bleakness of the previous scenes.

The author's decision to have Saeng make a vow to herself in the spring, a season often associated with new beginnings, underscores her desire to overcome the challenges she has faced. The image of the hibiscus, a flower often linked with beauty and resilience, further emphasizes Saeng's determination to persevere. The author's use of the word ""silently"" to describe Saeng's vow also suggests a sense of resolve and inner strength, implying that Saeng is not one to seek external validation or recognition.

Furthermore, the author's choice to have Saeng make this vow in the context of a test, which has been a source of anxiety and stress for her, highlights the significance of this moment. By linking her vow to the test, the author emphasizes the idea that Saeng's determination is not just about overcoming external obstacles, but also about overcoming her own self-doubt and fear.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of censorship, such as limiting artists' potential and hindering the pursuit of knowledge.

The writer's essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. The writer's argument that individuals should be able to choose what they read and avoid materials that offend them is a valid point, as it respects the autonomy of readers and acknowledges that people have different tastes and preferences.

However, the writer's approach to addressing the issue is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The suggestion to simply ""walk away"" from materials that offend is not a practical solution, as it may not be feasible or desirable for everyone. Moreover, the writer's assertion that libraries should not be responsible for policing the content of every book or material is not entirely convincing, as libraries have a responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all patrons.

Furthermore, the writer's reliance on personal anecdotes and general statements (""Different people like different things"") does not provide sufficient evidence to support their argument. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments, such as the need for libraries to protect minors from explicit or disturbing content.

Additionally, the writer's tone can be perceived as dismissive and condescending, particularly in the phrase ""you should just move away from that area."" This tone may alienate readers who may be genuinely concerned about the content of certain materials.

In conclusion, while the writer raises some valid points about the importance of individual freedom and the need for libraries to provide a diverse range of materials, their argument is not well-supported and could be strengthened with more nuanced and evidence-based reasoning.

The writer's personal experience and observations are evident in their arguments, although they could benefit from more concrete evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims.

One of the writer's primary concerns is that exposure to mature content can lead to poor academic performance. However, this argument is not well-supported, as there is no concrete evidence to suggest a direct correlation between exposure to mature content and poor academic performance. Furthermore, the writer's assertion that parents should be responsible for teaching children right from wrong is a simplistic solution that neglects the role of educators and the broader societal context.

The writer's essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and examples to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. For instance, the writer shares their personal experience of using the internet to research for school projects and communicate with family members through social media platforms like Facebook and Myspace. This helps to illustrate the practical applications of computers in everyday life.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the opposing viewpoint. The writer only briefly mentions the concerns of those who oppose the widespread use of computers, without providing a more in-depth exploration of these arguments. This lack of counterargumentation makes the essay feel somewhat one-sided and less convincing.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. There are grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing (e.g., ""I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about?""). These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on personal opinions and anecdotes, which, while engaging, do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. A more balanced approach that incorporates a range of perspectives and evidence-based information would strengthen the essay.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more attention to grammar, syntax, and the inclusion of counterarguments.

The essay provides a relatable scenario that effectively conveys the concept of patience. The writer successfully incorporates the prompt's requirements by including a story about a time when someone was patient. The narrative is engaging, and the use of dialogue effectively conveys the emotions and thoughts of the characters.

However, the writing could benefit from some refinement. The essay relies heavily on the use of all-caps names and words, which can come across as immature and unprofessional. This writing style detracts from the overall tone and credibility of the essay. Additionally, the writing lacks cohesion and transitions between sentences, making it difficult to follow at times.

The writer attempts to explain the concept of patience, but the explanation is somewhat superficial. The essay could benefit from more depth and analysis of the topic. The writer also fails to provide concrete examples or supporting details that would strengthen the argument.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and varied sentence structures. The writing is largely composed of simple sentences, which can make the text feel flat and unengaging.

Despite these limitations, the essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt and convey the concept of patience. With further refinement and attention to writing style, the essay has the potential to be more effective.

The essay presents a clear and straightforward argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses simple and concise language to convey their opinion, making it accessible to a middle school audience. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to substantiate the claims made. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks specific examples to illustrate the benefits of computers.

The writer's organization and structure are also somewhat disorganized, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of cohesive linking phrases. The writer's use of sentence structure is mostly simple, which may not engage the reader's attention. Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments and acknowledges the opposing viewpoint only briefly, which weakens the overall argument.

One notable aspect of the essay is the writer's attempt to use persuasive language, such as ""computers do benefit society"" and ""computers make life easier."" However, these statements are often vague and lack concrete evidence to support them.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims. They should also work on organizing their ideas more cohesively and addressing potential counterarguments more thoroughly.

The essay presents a clear and relatable argument against the excessive use of computers, citing concerns about the negative impact on physical health and social interactions. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and vivid imagery to illustrate their points, making the essay more engaging and persuasive. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a meandering structure. The writer also relies heavily on simplistic and emotive language, such as ""@CAPS3 are way better things to do"" and ""being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do."" While these phrases may be effective in conveying the writer's passion, they detract from the overall credibility of the argument.

Furthermore, the essay fails to provide concrete evidence to support the writer's claims. The writer's assertion that excessive computer use can lead to obesity is not backed by scientific evidence, and the anecdotal examples provided do not serve as a reliable basis for a broader argument. Additionally, the writer's criticism of computer use is overly broad, failing to acknowledge the many benefits that computers can bring, such as improved education and communication.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay is marred by numerous errors, including misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent punctuation. The writer's use of abbreviations and acronyms (""@CAPS1"", ""@CAPS2"", etc.) is also distracting and detracts from the overall clarity of the writing.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The student provides specific examples of the challenges, such as spontaneous combustion, the impact of air currents, and airship-related laws. However, the student could improve the coherence and organization of their ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the mooring mast to the obstacles faced by builders, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

The student also struggles with sentence-level writing. Many of the sentences are simple and lack variety in terms of structure and vocabulary. For example, the sentence ""Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law"" is a run-on sentence that could be broken up for better clarity. Additionally, the student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""the results would be even worse"" and ""it would mean that,"" which do not add much depth to the analysis.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the obstacles. For instance, the student mentions that the laws regulating airship flight set a limit on heights above urban areas, but does not explain the specific reasoning behind this limitation or how it affected the construction of the Empire State Building.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, drawing from the author's personal experience and observations. The author effectively uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and emotional appeals to emphasize their stance on removing books, movies, music, and magazines from library shelves that contain explicit content. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation, relying heavily on simplistic and unsubstantiated claims.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is its lack of critical thinking and analysis. The author fails to provide concrete evidence or credible sources to support their claims, instead relying on personal anecdotes and emotional appeals. For instance, the author states that they found a book about drugs to be ""very unappropate"" for little kids, but they do not provide any context or explanation for why this book was deemed inappropriate. Furthermore, the author's assertion that these materials belong in a separate building is not supported by any logical reasoning or evidence.

Additionally, the essay suffers from grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (e.g., ""conclusin"" instead of ""conclusion""), incorrect verb tenses (e.g., ""I believe that they should be removed form the shelves of libraries"" instead of ""I believe that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries""), and lack of varied sentence structures. These errors detract from the overall credibility and professionalism of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement and transitions between paragraphs. The author jumps abruptly from discussing the reasons for removing explicit content to making a conclusion without providing a clear summary of their main points.

The essay provides a relatable story about the importance of patience in forming friendships. The writer effectively conveys the idea that patience is essential in understanding and tolerating difficulties without complaining. However, the narrative is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and overreliance on abbreviations and capitalization.

One of the primary concerns is the writer's inability to maintain a consistent tone and voice throughout the essay. The use of multiple narrative voices and abrupt shifts in perspective create confusion and detract from the overall narrative. For instance, the writer switches between first-person and third-person narration, which disrupts the flow of the story.

Furthermore, the essay relies heavily on abbreviations and capitalization, which can be distracting and make the text difficult to read. The excessive use of @CAPS2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS3, for example, creates a sense of artificiality and detracts from the writer's message.

Additionally, the essay lacks cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of patience to sharing a story about a speech competition, and then shifts to a completely unrelated topic about the writer's friendship with @CAPS1. This disjointed structure makes it challenging for the reader to follow the writer's argument.

Despite these issues, the writer does demonstrate an understanding of the concept of patience and its importance in forming friendships. The story is engaging, and the writer's enthusiasm is evident throughout the essay.

One notable aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist is the presence of ""short rolling hills."" The writer mentions this feature as a potential hazard, stating ""Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit."" This sentence implies that the hills pose a risk to the cyclist, and the writer is advising them to exercise caution. However, this point is not fully developed, and the writer fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to support this claim.

Another aspect of the setting that could impact the cyclist is the ""porches.""

However, this connection is not explicitly stated, and the writer does not provide any further explanation or analysis.

The writer also mentions ""Never travel advice home old-timers,"" which could be interpreted as a reference to the wisdom of older cyclists. However, this statement is vague and lacks context, making it difficult to understand how it relates to the setting.

The concluding paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" serves as a powerful statement of determination and resilience. This conclusion is closely tied to the events that unfolded in the story, particularly Saeng's emotional journey and her encounter with the hibiscus plant.

The author skillfully weaves together the themes of hope, nature, and personal growth, as evident in the following sentence: ""As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, 'Saebba', Saeng whispered, 'Madagascar periwinkle', its tag pronounced."" This passage highlights Saeng's connection to her past and her desire to hold onto memories of home, which is further emphasized by her emotional response to the hibiscus plant. The image of the hibiscus, which is described as ""budding,"" symbolizes new beginnings and the possibility of growth, underscoring the idea that Saeng is not one to give up easily.

Moreover, the author effectively uses the character of Saeng's mother to convey the importance of support and encouragement. The mother's response to Saeng's admission of failure, as well as her decision to plant the hibiscus, serves as a powerful symbol of hope and second chances. The mother's actions demonstrate that even in the face of adversity, there is always the possibility for growth and renewal.

The concluding paragraph also showcases the author's skillful use of imagery and symbolism. The image of the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding creates a vivid picture of the cyclical nature of life, emphasizing the idea that every ending marks a new beginning. The use of the word ""vowed"" to describe Saeng's determination also adds a sense of finality and commitment, underscoring the idea that Saeng is resolute in her decision to take the test again.

Overall, the concluding paragraph effectively ties together the various themes and elements of the story, creating a sense of closure and hope.

However, the writer's argument is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns is the writer's reliance on vague statements and personal opinions, rather than providing specific examples or logical reasoning to support their stance. For instance, the writer claims that ""there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves,"" but fails to provide any evidence to back up this assertion. This lack of concrete evidence undermines the writer's credibility and makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often inconsistent, veering wildly from one idea to another without clear connections or transitions. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow. Additionally, the writer's use of slang and informal language (e.g., ""thier,"" ""tall them"") detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Despite these issues, the writer does raise some valid points about the importance of considering the potential consequences of censorship. The example of a magazine that might be removed due to its depiction of nudity is a reasonable concern, and the writer's suggestion that libraries should only remove materials that pose a significant risk to public safety is a thoughtful one.

While the writer provides some valid points, their essay lacks depth and organization, and their writing style is marred by grammatical errors, informal language, and a lack of concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the writer's main points is that computers provide entertainment, which is a valid argument. However, they fail to provide specific examples of how computers can be used for entertainment, instead relying on vague statements such as ""you could go on the computer"" and ""make them happy."" Additionally, the writer's use of phrases like ""what are supposed to do on a rainy day?"" and ""you could tell him if he gets his homework done"" comes across as simplistic and unconvincing.

The inclusion of specific examples, like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7,"" adds depth to the argument, although the latter appears to be a song title and not a book title, which may raise questions about the writer's credibility.

However, the essay suffers from several issues. The writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity, with frequent use of abbreviations and colloquial expressions (""sutable,"" ""incable,"" ""hos""). This makes it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought and understand their arguments. Additionally, the writer's tone can be perceived as biased and emotive, with phrases like ""I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out"" coming across as somewhat defensive.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention that certain books and media are being censored, they do not offer any data or statistics to back up their assertions. This lack of evidence undermines the writer's credibility and makes their argument less convincing.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing book censorship to music and movies, without a clear connection between the two topics. This disjointed structure makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought and understand their overall argument.

Overall, while the writer shows enthusiasm and conviction, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and evidence-based argumentation.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, highlighting the importance of individual freedom of expression and the subjective nature of what may be considered offensive. The author effectively uses personal anecdotes and real-life examples to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and accessible to a middle school audience.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the diversity of opinions on censorship. The author recognizes that people have different perspectives on what is acceptable and what is not, and that it is impossible to please everyone. This nuance is particularly evident in the author's discussion of their own personal experiences with certain topics, such as abortion, and how they may not be universally accepted.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated and nuanced arguments. At times, the writing feels a bit simplistic, and the author relies heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning. For example, the statement ""Killing a child that has not experienced the thing you have is not right"" is a powerful sentiment, but it could be supported with more concrete evidence or logical reasoning.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay and make it more difficult to follow.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the issue of censorship and the importance of individual freedom of expression. With more attention to writing quality and the development of more nuanced arguments, the essay has the potential to be even more effective in persuading readers.

The essay provides a brief attempt to discuss the concept of patience, but it lacks depth and coherence. The writer starts by mentioning a personal experience, but the story is fragmented and lacks a clear structure. The writer's attempt to convey the idea of patience is hindered by the use of informal language and abbreviations (e.g., ""me and my dad,"" ""@NUM1""). The writer's tone also shifts abruptly from frustration to calmness without a clear explanation.

The writer could have explored the concept of patience more thoroughly by providing more details about the situation and how it made them feel. For example, they could have described the emotions they experienced while waiting in line, how they overcame their impatience, and what they learned from the experience. Additionally, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

The essay also lacks a clear thesis statement or main argument, which makes it difficult to understand the writer's perspective on patience. A stronger essay would have a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay and provides a clear direction for the writer's argument.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, resilience, and the cyclical nature of life, as evident in the story. The author's decision to wait until spring to retake the test is not just a simple statement of timing, but rather a reflection of the emotional state of the character, Saeng.

The author supports this interpretation by highlighting the contrast between the current state of the hibiscus, which is ""budding,"" and the previous state, which is not mentioned but implied to be barren. This contrast serves as a metaphor for Saeng's emotional state, suggesting that she is currently in a state of dormancy, much like the hibiscus. The image of the geese returning also adds to this theme, implying a sense of renewal and rejuvenation.

Furthermore, the author's use of sensory details, such as the melting of the snows and the return of the geese, creates a vivid picture of the natural world, which serves to underscore the cyclical nature of life. The author's decision to wait until spring to retake the test is not just a practical decision, but a symbolic one, reflecting Saeng's desire to wait for a time of renewal and growth.

The author's writing style also contributes to the effectiveness of this conclusion. The use of simple, yet evocative language, such as ""hibiscus is budding,"" creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, drawing the reader into Saeng's emotional state. The author's decision to use a vow, rather than a more explicit statement, adds to the sense of determination and resolve, suggesting that Saeng is committed to her goal.

Overall, the conclusion effectively ties together the themes and motifs of the story, creating a sense of closure and resolution. The author's use of sensory details, symbolism, and effective writing style all contribute to a powerful and memorable conclusion.

The author's attempt to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir is commendable, but it lacks depth and clarity. The student provides a general statement that the mood is ""sad"" and explains that it's due to remembering good times that won't happen again, but this explanation is too simplistic and doesn't provide specific evidence from the memoir to support the claim. The student also jumps to conclusions about the author's feelings, stating that the author is ""happy for having a good childhood"" and ""feeling greatful"" without providing textual evidence to back up these assertions.

To improve, the student should have provided more specific examples from the memoir to support their analysis. For instance, they could have discussed how the author describes a particular event or memory that evokes a sense of sadness, or analyzed how the author's tone and language contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. Additionally, the student could have explored the complexities of the author's emotions, acknowledging that the mood may be bittersweet or nostalgic rather than simply sad.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more precise vocabulary and sentence structure. Phrases such as ""that's how I think the author's mood would be"" come across as overly simplistic and don't add much to the analysis. The student should strive to use more nuanced language and provide more detailed explanations to support their claims.

Overall, while the student demonstrates some understanding of the prompt, their analysis could benefit from more depth, specificity, and technical skill.

The student's essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, highlighting the importance of individual freedom of expression and the need for balance between protecting readers and allowing access to diverse perspectives.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argument. The student's stance on censorship is simplistic, relying on personal experiences and anecdotal evidence rather than providing a well-reasoned and evidence-based argument. The essay also fails to consider alternative perspectives and the potential consequences of censorship.

Furthermore, the writing quality is marred by grammatical errors, lack of organization, and unclear sentence structure. The student's writing style is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay.

The essay could benefit from more attention to detail, clarity, and coherence. The student could also benefit from exploring the complexities of censorship, including the potential impact on free speech, intellectual freedom, and the role of libraries in promoting critical thinking and cultural diversity.

The essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the benefits of computers in society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the essay more engaging and persuasive. For instance, the writer shares their personal experience of staying connected with their cousin and aunt through computers, which highlights the importance of technology in bridging geographical gaps. The writer also provides concrete examples of how computers can aid in learning, such as online classes and educational games, which demonstrate the potential of technology to enhance education.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the opposing viewpoint. The writer primarily focuses on the benefits of computers, without adequately addressing the concerns of those who believe that excessive computer use can have negative effects on individuals and society. A more balanced approach would strengthen the argument and make it more convincing.

Additionally, the writer could improve their writing style by using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. Some sentences, such as ""from computers you can learn, talk to people from out of state or even out of the county,"" are simplistic and lack clarity. The writer could also benefit from more precise and concise language, such as using specific examples and statistics to support their claims.

Furthermore, the writer could improve their organization and coherence by using transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas more smoothly. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to sharing personal anecdotes, which can make it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the natural world, which is characterized by the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. The image of the geese returning suggests a cyclical renewal, implying that life is full of opportunities for new beginnings. The author's decision to take the test again, tied to the arrival of spring, reinforces this idea, as it implies that Saeng is willing to face challenges and take risks in order to achieve her goals.

Furthermore, the author's use of the word ""vowed"" to describe Saeng's decision suggests a sense of determination and resolve. This word choice implies that Saeng is committed to her goal, and that she is willing to make sacrifices in order to achieve it. The fact that she makes this vow ""silently"" also suggests that she is determined to keep her promise to herself, without the need for external validation or recognition.

The author's conclusion also serves to underscore the themes of resilience and perseverance that are present throughout the story. Saeng's decision to take the test again, despite the challenges she has faced, demonstrates her ability to bounce back from adversity and to keep moving forward. This conclusion provides a sense of closure and finality to the story, while also leaving the reader with a sense of hope and optimism.

The writer presents a clear and passionate argument against censorship in libraries, citing the importance of freedom of expression and the inevitability of material being discovered despite attempts to hide it. The essay effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support the writer's stance, making it relatable and engaging. However, the writing could benefit from more cohesive structure and transitions between paragraphs. At times, the text appears to be a collection of disconnected thoughts and phrases rather than a well-organized essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use rhetorical devices, such as allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, to add depth and context to their argument. The writer also effectively uses metaphors, like comparing censorship to trying to control people, to convey their point. Additionally, the writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""So really, either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive,"" adds to the persuasive nature of the essay.

However, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. While they mention that people will always find a way to access the material, they do not provide concrete examples or evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, the writer's argument relies heavily on the assumption that everyone shares the same values and perspectives, which is not necessarily true.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay contains several errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. The writer could benefit from proofreading and editing to improve the clarity and coherence of their writing.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, making the text feel disjointed and difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence ""Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The inclusion of sensory details, such as the sound of the rain and the feeling of mud, adds depth to the narrative.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's voice and personality. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""I was the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things,"" and ""I started cracking up laughing about [her] hideous monster,"" effectively conveys the writer's humor and lightheartedness. The writer also demonstrates a good sense of pacing, gradually building up to the climax of the story and then resolving it in a satisfying way.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and straightforward, which can make the text feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in punctuation, which can detract from the overall quality of the writing.

The author successfully incorporates the definition of patience and its benefits, highlighting the positive impact it has on the protagonist's experience.

However, the essay could benefit from some refinement in terms of grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.

The writer's central argument against censorship in libraries is that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive. While the writer raises some valid concerns about the potential impact of explicit content on children, their approach is marred by several issues, including a lack of clarity, grammatical errors, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns raised by the writer is the potential for libraries to be sued if they fail to remove objectionable materials. However, this argument is based on a simplistic and overly broad view of the role of libraries. Libraries are not solely responsible for policing the content of books and other materials, and removing all objectionable materials would likely infringe upon the freedom of expression and access to information that is protected by the First Amendment.

Furthermore, the writer's assertion that certain books, such as ""sex for dummies,"" are inherently objectionable and should be removed from libraries is not supported by evidence. Many books on sex education and relationships are written in a neutral and informative tone, and are intended to provide accurate and helpful information to readers. Removing such books from libraries would limit access to important information and perpetuate a culture of censorship.

The writer also raises concerns about the potential impact of explicit content on children, but fails to provide any concrete evidence to support this claim. While it is true that exposure to explicit content can be harmful, it is also true that many children are exposed to such content through other means, such as television and the internet. Libraries can play an important role in providing access to information and promoting critical thinking and media literacy, rather than simply removing objectionable materials.

In addition, the writer's criticism of advertisements in magazines is also unfounded. While some advertisements may be objectionable, many others are harmless and provide valuable information about products and services. The writer's suggestion that people should ""look into this more"" is vague and does not provide any concrete solutions to the problem.

Overall, the writer's argument against censorship in libraries is based on a flawed understanding of the role of libraries and the importance of freedom of expression. While some objectionable materials should be removed from libraries, this should be done in a thoughtful and nuanced manner that balances the need to protect children with the need to promote access to information and freedom of expression.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, renewal, and perseverance that are woven throughout the narrative. The author's decision to retake the test is not just about academic success, but also about the cyclical nature of life, where the changing of the seasons brings new opportunities for growth and learning.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the ""hibiscus is budding,"" creates a vivid image of the natural world and highlights the connection between the natural world and the protagonist's emotional state. The image of the geese returning also serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, suggesting that even in difficult times, there is always the possibility for new beginnings.

Furthermore, the author's decision to retake the test is motivated by a desire to learn and grow, rather than simply to avoid failure. This is evident in the phrase ""I will take that test again,"" which suggests a sense of determination and resilience. The author's tone is also reflective and introspective, as Saeng ""vowed silently to herself,"" implying a sense of personal commitment and resolve.

Overall, the conclusion effectively ties together the narrative threads of the story and provides a sense of closure and resolution. The author's use of sensory details, symbolism, and introspection creates a rich and nuanced portrayal of the protagonist's emotional state, making the conclusion a satisfying and meaningful ending to the story.

The author effectively conveys a sense of belonging, comfort, and gratitude in the memoir, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The use of sensory details, such as ""the innocence of childhood,"" ""congregation of family and friends,"" and ""endless celebrations,"" helps to establish a strong emotional connection with the reader. The author's emphasis on the importance of family and community is also noteworthy, as evident in the statement, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" This sentiment is reinforced by the author's expression of gratitude towards his parents, which adds a sense of depth and sincerity to the narrative.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and specific examples to support the author's claims. At times, the language is somewhat generic, and the connections between ideas could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother, as some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Overall, the author demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of family and community in creating a sense of belonging and comfort. With further refinement and attention to detail, the essay has the potential to be even more effective in conveying the author's message.

The writer's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument on the benefits of technology in modern society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the essay more relatable and engaging. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear topic sentences. The writer also relies heavily on colloquial expressions and slang, which may make the essay difficult to understand for some readers.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to address multiple perspectives on the topic. They acknowledge the concerns of those who believe that technology is detrimental to society, but then provide counterarguments to support their own position. This demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the ability to think critically.

However, the writer could benefit from more evidence-based research to support their claims. While they mention statistics, they do not provide concrete data to back up their assertions. Additionally, the writer's arguments often rely on generalizations and assumptions, such as the idea that people will naturally return to nature and socialize more once they are exposed to environmental activism or new forms of entertainment.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish. The use of slang and colloquial expressions can make the essay feel immature and unprofessional. The writer could benefit from using more formal language and avoiding filler words and phrases, such as ""I mean"" and ""you know.""

The fact that she is willing to wait until the snows melt and the geese return suggests that she values the changing of the seasons and the renewal of life. The mention of the hibiscus flower, which is a symbol of beauty and growth, further emphasizes her connection to nature. By linking her decision to take the test again to the blooming of the hibiscus, the author creates a sense of continuity and promise, implying that Saeng is committed to her goals and is willing to work towards them patiently.

The use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of solemnity and determination, suggesting that Saeng is making a promise to herself. This is reinforced by the fact that she is making this promise silently, implying that she is deeply committed to her decision.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging account of the importance of laughter in the writer's life. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the contagious nature of laughter and its ability to bring people together. The use of sensory details, such as the warm air and the sound of laughter, helps to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to convey their personal connection to laughter. The writer's favorite memory of laughter is a heartwarming and authentic account that showcases the joy and happiness that laughter can bring. The writer's use of metaphors, such as comparing laughter to sunshine, adds depth and creativity to the essay.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. Some sentences, such as ""Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life"" and ""Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us,"" feel a bit simplistic and could be rephrased for more impact. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to create a more dynamic and engaging writing style.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more explicit connections to the prompt. While the writer mentions that laughter is an important part of relationships, they do not fully develop this idea.

Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for clarity and concision.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination"" and ""computers help town in countless ways""), is effective in emphasizing the importance of computers.

The inclusion of specific locations, like ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp,"" adds to the narrative's sense of isolation and desolation.

The author also effectively conveys the cyclist's emotional state through his thoughts and actions.

The writer also uses quotes from the essay to support their argument, such as ""sometimes life can be so cruel"" and ""I felt as If it would never end,"" which demonstrate the cyclist's emotional turmoil.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. The writer primarily focuses on the physical features of the setting, such as the lack of shade and water, without exploring the symbolic significance of these elements. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the cyclist's character and how his personality influences his perception of the setting.

This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the natural world, which is closely tied to the character's emotional state. The mention of the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding creates a vivid image of springtime, a season often associated with new beginnings and growth. This imagery serves as a powerful motivator for Saeng, as she associates these natural events with feelings of comfort and well-being.

The author also uses the character's personal connection to her grandma, as mentioned in the essay, to explain her motivation. The fact that Saeng used to help her grandma with her hair before moving away suggests a strong bond between the two, and the blooming of the hibiscus flower serves as a tangible reminder of this connection. By linking the natural world to her personal experiences and emotions, the author creates a sense of authenticity and depth in the story.

However, the essay could benefit from more explicit connections between the author's ideas and the text.

This conclusion is significant because it highlights Saeng's longing for her native place, which is evident in her association of the spring season with the return of geese and the budding of the hibiscus flower. The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting of snow and the return of geese, effectively evokes a sense of nostalgia and yearning in the reader.

Furthermore, the author's decision to link the test-taking to the spring season suggests that Saeng's motivation for taking the test is not just about academic achievement, but also about reconnecting with her cultural heritage. The fact that she is willing to wait until the spring to take the test implies that she is willing to be patient and wait for the right moment to return to her homeland, which reinforces her emotional connection to the place.

The author's conclusion also raises questions about Saeng's past and her experiences in her homeland. The mention of the hibiscus flower, which is often associated with Hawaii, suggests that Saeng may have been born or lived in Hawaii, and her desire to return to her homeland implies that she has been away from it for some time. The author's use of the phrase ""when they come back"" also implies that Saeng is referring to a specific event or experience that occurred in her past, which adds to the sense of nostalgia and longing.

The essay effectively explores how the features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's experience. The author skillfully weaves together vivid descriptions of the desolate landscape, using sensory details to convey the cyclist's growing desperation and frustration. For instance, the phrase ""lifeless and waterless"" effectively conveys the cyclist's dire situation, while the image of the pump dispensing ""battery acid-tasting water"" is a powerful metaphor for the cyclist's dwindling hope. The author also uses the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign to foreshadow the challenges that lie ahead, creating a sense of tension and foreboding.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist. While the author highlights the negative aspects of the setting, they do not fully explore the ways in which the environment shapes the cyclist's emotions, thoughts, and actions. Additionally, some of the language and imagery, such as the ""beacon of hope"" at the fish camp, feels somewhat clichéd and could be more effectively developed.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level crafting. Some sentences feel a bit simplistic or cliche (""To him, this simple bait shop was like a beacon of hope from himself""), and could be revised to create more complex and varied sentence structures.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist, but could benefit from more depth, nuance, and attention to sentence-level craft.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey Saeng's determination and resilience in the face of adversity. This conclusion effectively reinforces the themes of perseverance and hope that are woven throughout the narrative. The author's use of sensory details, such as the mention of spring, snows, geese, and the budding hibiscus, creates a vivid image of a new beginning, emphasizing Saeng's resolve to try again.

The author's decision to have Saeng make this vow in the spring, a season often associated with renewal and rebirth, underscores her desire to start anew and leave past failures behind. The phrase ""when the snows melt"" suggests a transition from a period of hardship to a time of growth and possibility. Furthermore, the image of the geese returning implies a sense of community and companionship, which is significant given Saeng's solitary journey.

The author's use of the word ""vowed"" also conveys a sense of solemnity and commitment, emphasizing Saeng's determination to succeed. The phrase ""I will take that test again"" is a clear statement of her resolve, and the use of the word ""again"" implies a sense of repetition and perseverance. This conclusion effectively leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism, suggesting that Saeng will ultimately overcome her challenges.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claims, making the text more engaging and relatable. For instance, the comparison of hand-eye coordination in sports and the ability to quickly research information using computers is a clever way to illustrate the positive effects of technology.

The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""get addicting,"" ""exersize,"" and ""gots worse,"" adds a touch of authenticity to the writing, making it more accessible to a middle school audience.

However, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. The writer relies heavily on simple sentences and lacks variety in their sentence length and complexity. Additionally, some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as ""thie familys"" and ""dont study for a test or do home work."" These errors detract from the overall credibility of the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is somewhat inconsistent, veering between persuasive and informal.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and accessible to a middle school audience. However, the writing could benefit from more organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the availability of offensive materials to advocating for censorship, and the transitions between ideas could be smoother.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use persuasive language and rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell"") and emotional appeals (""it's sad that type of material is available in a school""). However, these devices are often used in a way that feels manipulative rather than persuasive. The writer could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language to convey their message.

The essay also raises some valid points about the importance of protecting children from exposure to offensive materials. The writer is correct that libraries should be a place for learning and reading, and that excessive exposure to violent or explicit content can have negative effects on children's development. However, the essay could benefit from more thoughtful consideration of the complexities of censorship and the potential consequences of removing certain materials from libraries.

In terms of content, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the writer's claims. For example, the writer could discuss specific books or movies that they believe should be removed from libraries, and explain why they think they are problematic. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more consideration of alternative solutions to censorship, such as providing parents with resources and support to help them make informed decisions about their children's media consumption.

The writer's primary argument is that excessive computer use has negative effects on individuals, including addiction, distraction, exposure to inappropriate content, and potential brain damage. While the writer presents some valid concerns, their essay lacks a clear and convincing structure, and the supporting evidence is often anecdotal and based on a single source. The writer also fails to provide a balanced perspective, as they do not acknowledge the benefits of computers, such as improved learning and communication.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""computers are not beneficial"") and allusion (""our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people""). However, these devices often come across as overly simplistic and lacking in depth. The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

The writer's use of specific examples, such as the anecdote about the student who didn't do their homework because they were on the computer, is effective in illustrating the point, but it is not a strong argument in itself. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying instead on hearsay and unsubstantiated statements.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often confrontational and accusatory, which may alienate readers who do not share their perspective.

The essay presents a clear and relatable stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, with the writer expressing concerns about the impact of certain materials on young minds. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, making the essay more engaging and persuasive.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance opposing views. The writer acknowledges that there are instances where censorship is necessary, but also recognizes the importance of freedom of expression. This nuanced approach demonstrates an understanding of the complexity of the issue.

However, the essay could benefit from more concrete and specific examples to support the writer's claims. For instance, the writer mentions that certain books and music are ""well-written and fabulous to read,"" but fails to provide concrete examples of such works. Additionally, the writer's arguments about the impact of certain music on young minds are based on generalizations, rather than specific instances.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can be inconsistent, veering between passionate and confrontational. While the writer's emotions are understandable, a more measured tone would make the essay more effective in persuading the reader.

The writer also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the writer uses phrases such as ""Thats why i have a great deal of reespect"" and ""Tghe reporters are on the citizens side,"" which are grammatically incorrect.

Despite these limitations, the essay demonstrates a clear passion for the issue and a desire to make a difference. With further refinement and attention to detail, the writer has the potential to produce a more effective and persuasive essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to emphasize Saeng's resilience and determination. This conclusion is supported by the author's description of the winter hibiscus, which is ""not in the ground now"" (Essay, line 1). This suggests that the harsh winter conditions have taken a toll on Saeng's plants, and she is aware of the potential loss. By mentioning the snows melting and geese returning, the author highlights the cyclical nature of the seasons, implying that life will continue to flourish once the winter is over. The image of the hibiscus budding in the spring serves as a symbol of new beginnings and renewal. Furthermore, Saeng's vow to take the test again is a direct response to the loss of her plants, demonstrating her willingness to start anew and rebuild. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of resilience, renewal, and the cyclical nature of life, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and optimism.

The essay provides a clear and concise thesis statement that attempts to identify the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student provides a single example from the text to support their argument, which is a good start, but it is not enough to fully develop their claim. The student also fails to provide any textual evidence to support their interpretation of the mood, instead relying on their own interpretation. Furthermore, the writing is simplistic and lacks transitions between sentences, making the essay feel disjointed.

Additionally, the student's analysis is not supported by a thorough understanding of the text. The quote provided is taken out of context and does not demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the author's intentions. The student's interpretation of the mood as happiness is also not fully supported by the text, as the author's tone and language suggest a more complex emotional landscape.

To improve, the student should provide more textual evidence to support their analysis, engage with the author's language and tone, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the text. They should also work on organizing their ideas more effectively and using more sophisticated vocabulary.

The writer presents a well-structured and passionate argument against censorship in libraries, effectively utilizing personal experiences and observations to support their stance. They effectively address the importance of freedom of expression and the potential consequences of censorship on individuals and society. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (""open the door to other beliefs and cultures"") and allusions (""the sixties and seventies""), adds depth and nuance to their argument.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and a clearer organization. At times, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of books to the impact of censorship on music. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to understand.

The writer's use of first-person pronouns (""I believe,"" ""Personally,"" ""I have always had"") can also make the essay feel somewhat informal and lacking in authority. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. While they mention the historical context of the 1960s and 1970s, they do not provide specific examples of how music was used as a form of protest during that time.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a clear passion for the topic and a strong understanding of the importance of freedom of expression. With some revisions to address the issues mentioned above, this essay has the potential to be even more effective in persuading readers to their point of view.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable argument against censorship in libraries, citing the quote from Katherine Paterson to emphasize the importance of individual freedom of choice. The student effectively uses personal opinions and experiences to support their stance, making the essay more engaging and persuasive.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple perspectives on the issue. The student acknowledges that some materials may be found offensive and proposes solutions to mitigate this problem, such as designating a specific aisle for such content and requiring adult supervision for children. However, the student also recognizes that individuals have the right to avoid certain materials and can simply walk away or make a complaint if they are offended.

The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. For example, the student mentions that children may be influenced by what they see, but does not elaborate on the long-term effects of censorship on a child's cognitive development or their ability to think critically. Additionally, the student's argument that individuals can simply walk away or make a complaint if they are offended oversimplifies the issue, as it does not account for the potential impact of censorship on marginalized communities or individuals who may not have the same level of access to alternative resources.

The writer also explores the theme of embarrassment and hurt feelings, which is a common experience for many middle school students. The scene where the writer's sister pulls down their pants in front of their neighbor is a relatable and cringe-worthy moment that many readers can identify with.

The writer's essay raises an important concern about censorship in libraries, highlighting the need to balance freedom of expression with the potential harm that certain materials can cause to young minds. The writer's personal experience and observations are evident in their arguments, making their perspective more relatable and engaging.

One of the writer's strengths is their ability to provide concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, they discuss how music can be a powerful motivator for young people, but also how some songs may contain explicit language that can be detrimental to their well-being. Similarly, they mention how books with offensive language can lead to children learning things they shouldn't, which is a valid concern. However, the writer could have taken their arguments further by providing more nuanced and detailed examples to illustrate their points.

The writer's suggestion of creating age-based sections in libraries is also a thought-provoking idea. However, it is essential to consider the complexity of individual maturity levels and the potential consequences of restricting access to certain materials. For example, some children may be more mature and able to handle mature themes than others, and restricting access to certain materials may not necessarily prevent them from accessing them elsewhere.

The writer's writing style is clear and concise, but there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and a more sophisticated vocabulary. Additionally, the writer often relies on simplistic phrases, such as ""I think that we should"" or ""I really think,"" which can make their arguments feel less convincing.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the issue of censorship in libraries and raises important questions about the role of parents, educators, and society in protecting young people from harm.

The opening quote by Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, highlighting the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. However, the writer's argument is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary concerns is the writer's inconsistent use of grammar and punctuation. The essay is riddled with errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. For instance, the sentence ""I do belive in censorship, but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal"" should be rewritten as ""I believe in censorship, but I think it's not that big of a deal."" This inconsistency detracts from the writer's credibility and makes it challenging to take their argument seriously.

Furthermore, the writer's argument lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the role of parents in blocking materials to making a general statement about censorship. The writer also fails to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claims, making it difficult to understand their perspective. For example, they mention that they have never found a book to be ""affensive or disterbing,"" but this anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to support their broader argument.

Additionally, the writer's views on censorship are overly simplistic and lack nuance. They suggest that censorship should only be used to block materials that are ""bad"" or ""graphic,"" but fail to consider the complexities of individual differences and varying levels of maturity. This approach neglects the importance of critical thinking and media literacy, which are essential skills for navigating complex issues like censorship.

In conclusion, while the writer's essay raises some thought-provoking questions about censorship, it is ultimately undermined by its grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and oversimplification of complex issues. With further refinement and attention to detail, the writer could develop a more compelling and persuasive argument.

The essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the benefits of computers in everyday life. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claim, making the essay more engaging and accessible to the reader. The writer's use of simple and concise language is suitable for a middle school level, and they demonstrate a good understanding of the topic.

However, the essay lacks depth and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to mentioning specific products and websites, such as Facebook and Myspace, without a clear connection to the main argument. Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. For instance, the sentence ""I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog"" is unclear and grammatically incorrect.

Furthermore, the writer fails to address the counterargument presented in the prompt, which highlights concerns about the negative effects of excessive computer use. The writer's response to this concern is non-existent, which undermines the strength of their argument.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, using more precise language, and addressing potential counterarguments. With revisions, this essay has the potential to become a stronger and more persuasive piece of writing.

The essay presents a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the benefits of computers on individuals. The writer effectively utilizes various points to support their claim, including the ability to communicate with others online, access to educational resources, and the development of hand-eye coordination through gaming. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence, with some sentences feeling disconnected and lacking supporting evidence.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to engage the reader with relatable examples, such as the scenario of needing to ask a friend a question urgently and the example of finding a singing agent through email. These anecdotes help to illustrate the convenience and accessibility of computers in everyday life. Additionally, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the benefits of computers in education, including the ability to learn about faraway places and important people without leaving home.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. For instance, the writer could have explored the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, such as decreased physical activity and social isolation, to provide a more balanced perspective. Furthermore, some sentences feel simplistic or cliche, such as ""The mind is an extraordinary thing"" or ""Computers are a great way to communicate."" These phrases detract from the overall credibility of the argument.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to the benefits of gaming and hand-eye coordination. A clearer transition between these ideas would improve the flow of the essay. Additionally, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the benefits of computers, but could benefit from more depth, nuance, and organization to make a more compelling argument.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" to convey a sense of hope and renewal. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of growth, perseverance, and the cyclical nature of life. The author skillfully uses sensory details, such as the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, to create a vivid image of the changing seasons. This imagery serves as a metaphor for Saeng's personal growth and her renewed determination to overcome challenges.

The author's use of the phrase ""I will take that test again"" is a powerful statement of resolve, implying that Saeng has learned from her past experiences and is now more confident in her abilities. This conclusion also leaves room for interpretation, allowing the reader to wonder what specific test Saeng is referring to and what challenges she will face in the future.

The essay presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, effectively utilizing personal anecdotes, observations, and literary examples to support the writer's stance. The writer successfully highlights the importance of individual perspectives and the subjective nature of interpretation, emphasizing that one person's opinion should not dictate the removal of books from library shelves.

The writer's use of specific examples, such as the book ""@CAPS1,"" effectively illustrates the point that graphic content does not necessarily dictate a book's value or worth. The mention of the book's numerous awards and its inclusion in college-level reading lists serves as a strong counterpoint to the idea that censorship is necessary. The writer also astutely observes that readers are often warned about the maturity level of the content, and that books are sorted according to genre and age, making it easier for readers to make informed choices.

The writer's argument is further strengthened by their critique of the tendency to overlook the opinions of other readers when it comes to book censorship. By pointing out that this approach can be seen as favoritism, the writer highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to censorship, one that takes into account the diversity of reader perspectives.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar and clarity. Some sentences are worded awkwardly, and the writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve overall flow. Additionally, the writer could provide more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions, to make their argument more convincing.

The writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people is presented in a clear and relatable manner, making it easy for the reader to understand their perspective. However, the essay lacks a strong structure and organization, with ideas and sentences often running together without clear transitions. The writer also uses informal language and slang, which detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of evidence to support the writer's claims. While they mention some potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, such as eye strain and decreased physical activity, they fail to provide concrete examples or statistics to back up these assertions. This makes it difficult to take their arguments seriously.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often confrontational and accusatory, with phrases such as ""the use of technology is being abused!"" and ""the world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to original idea of tecnology."" This tone comes across as overly dramatic and may alienate readers who do not share the writer's extreme views.

Additionally, the writer's use of personal anecdotes and exaggerated statements, such as ""I know more than @NUM1 kids that have glasses now,"" is not convincing and undermines the credibility of their argument. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and alternative perspectives, which would strengthen their position and make their argument more convincing.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay contains several errors, including misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent punctuation. For example, the writer uses ""it's"" and ""its"" interchangeably, which can be confusing and detract from the overall clarity of the essay.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable argument on the impact of computers on society. The writer acknowledges the opposing viewpoint, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to substantiate the claim that computers have a positive effect on people. The writer relies heavily on general statements and personal opinions, which may not be convincing for readers who have different perspectives.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of concrete examples and supporting details. The writer mentions that computers help with research, but fails to provide specific examples or credible sources to back up this claim. Additionally, the writer's argument is often contradicted by their own statements, such as ""computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either."" This inconsistency undermines the writer's credibility and makes it difficult to take their argument seriously.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often informal and lacks polish, with grammatical errors and simplistic sentence structures.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's decision to take the shortcut to the consequences of the setting, and the transitions between ideas could be smoother.

One notable aspect of the essay is the writer's use of sensory details, such as the feeling of the sun scorching down on the cyclist's back and the sound of rocks in the mouth (presumably referring to the sound of rocks hitting the bike's chain or gears). These sensory details help to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and make the experience more engaging.

The writer also raises an important point about the importance of being prepared for the route and the potential consequences of not being prepared. This is a valuable lesson for cyclists, and the writer's emphasis on this point is well-taken.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address multiple perspectives on the issue. The writer acknowledges the opposing view that computers have benefits, but instead of simply dismissing it, they provide evidence to counter these claims. For example, the writer mentions that some experts believe computers teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to learn about faraway places and people, but they argue that these benefits are outweighed by the negative consequences.

However, the essay also has some significant weaknesses. The writer's tone can come across as sensational and alarmist, with phrases such as ""brain problems, hard time seeing, and the biggest thing is death."" This tone may be off-putting to some readers and detract from the writer's argument. Additionally, the essay relies heavily on anecdotal evidence, with the interview with the eye doctor being the only credible source cited. While this can make the essay more engaging, it also raises questions about the writer's ability to provide a balanced and evidence-based argument.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity. The use of slang terms such as ""get off your butt"" and ""butt"" can make the essay feel juvenile, and the writing could benefit from more precise and concise language.

The author effectively concludes the story with the final paragraph to convey the theme of acceptance and determination. The author skillfully weaves together the symbolism of the hibiscus plant, the changing seasons, and Saeng's personal aspirations to create a powerful message. The use of the phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" is particularly effective in evoking a sense of renewal and new beginnings. This phrase is supported by the author's description of the hibiscus plant as a symbol of Saeng's homeland and the things she left behind, highlighting the significance of her connection to her roots.

The author also cleverly ties the theme of determination to the final sentence, where Saeng vows to retake the test. This shows that despite the challenges she has faced, Saeng remains committed to her goals and is willing to work towards achieving them.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The text is heavy on simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, some of the language used, such as "" thats"" instead of ""that's,"" detracts from the overall clarity and polish of the writing.

Despite these areas for improvement, the essay demonstrates a clear and heartfelt expression of the author's feelings about home and family. The author's appreciation for their parents' sacrifices and their own experiences as a member of a family of immigrants is palpable, and their use of sensory details, such as ""happyness, joy and peace,"" effectively evokes a sense of warmth and comfort.

The essay provides a relatable and engaging account of a personal experience with patience. The writer effectively conveys the excitement and anticipation of opening presents on a special day, making it easy for the reader to connect with their emotions. The use of descriptive language, such as ""I felt like I had ants in my pants"" and ""time seemed to go by so slow,"" effectively conveys the writer's eagerness and frustration.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the church service to the excitement of opening presents, and then to the disappointment of receiving a sleeping bag as a gift. Smoother transitions would improve the flow of the essay.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the concept of patience. While the essay mentions that the writer had to be patient, it doesn't delve deeper into what that means or how it was applied in the situation. Exploring this further would add depth to the essay and make it more thought-provoking.

The writer also uses some grammatical errors, such as ""we open presents?"" and ""I was @CAPS6,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay. While the anonymization of personal information is appreciated, these errors should be addressed to improve the writing quality.

Overall, the essay provides a good starting point for exploring the concept of patience, but could benefit from refinement in terms of organization, analysis, and grammar.

The student's essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, highlighting the importance of individual freedom and the potential consequences of censorship. The student's argument that libraries should not remove materials deemed offensive is well-supported by their personal experience and observations.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to express their opinions and thoughts in a clear and concise manner. They effectively use rhetorical devices such as repetition (""I think that..."") and metaphors (""The libary is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting"") to convey their ideas. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language to elevate the writing to a higher level.

The student's argument that libraries should not restrict access to materials based on personal preferences is a valid one. They correctly point out that individuals have the right to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch, and that censorship can be seen as an infringement on this right. The student also provides a compelling personal anecdote about their own experiences with music and how it has shaped their interests.

However, the essay could benefit from more evidence-based arguments to support the student's claims. For example, they could cite examples of books or movies that have been challenged or banned in libraries in the past, and discuss the impact of censorship on intellectual freedom. Additionally, the student could explore the potential benefits of having diverse materials in libraries, such as promoting critical thinking and cultural understanding.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. While these errors do not detract from the overall message of the essay, they do detract from the student's credibility and make the writing seem less polished.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the issue of censorship in libraries and presents a clear and relatable argument. With more attention to language, evidence-based arguments, and attention to grammar and punctuation, the essay could be even stronger.

The essay presents a clear and passionate stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, with the writer arguing that certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive. The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, adds depth and context to their argument. However, the essay lacks a clear and structured approach, with ideas and sentences often feeling disconnected and lacking cohesion.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the writer's reliance on simplistic and binary thinking. The writer presents a stark contrast between ""offensive"" and ""not offensive"" materials, without considering the nuances and complexities of the issue. For example, the writer argues that books about slavery and racism are necessary to understand the past, but fails to acknowledge the harm and trauma that these topics can cause to readers. This lack of nuance makes it difficult to take the writer's argument seriously.

Furthermore, the writer's use of all capital letters and abbreviations (e.g. ""ect."", ""etc."", ""@CAPS1"", ""@CAPS2"", ""@CAPS3"") detracts from the overall professionalism and clarity of the essay. This writing style is more typical of a casual text message or social media post, rather than a formal essay.

Additionally, the writer's argument is not supported by concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The writer relies on emotional appeals and personal opinions, rather than presenting a well-reasoned argument. For example, the writer claims that ""some offensive things are part of history and shows how things progressed from back then to now,"" but fails to provide any specific examples or explanations to support this claim.

In conclusion, while the writer's passion and conviction are evident, the essay lacks the structure, nuance, and evidence-based reasoning necessary to make a compelling argument. With further development and refinement, the writer has the potential to produce a stronger essay.

The mention of spring, snows melting, and geese returning creates a vivid image of a season of rebirth, which serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own personal growth and determination.

The writer presents a well-structured and thought-provoking essay on the topic of censorship in libraries. The essay effectively incorporates the provided quote from Katherine Paterson, which serves as a compelling introduction to the discussion. The writer's argument that certain materials should not be removed from libraries due to their potential to spark discussions and provide historical context is well-supported by personal anecdotes and observations.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexities of the issue. The writer recognizes that some materials may be considered offensive or inappropriate, but argues that this does not justify their removal from public access. The writer also highlights the importance of education and the value of learning from literature that may be considered harsh or disturbing.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of censorship. While the writer raises valid points about the importance of preserving historical context and promoting critical thinking, they do not fully address potential counterarguments. For example, some might argue that certain materials are so deeply hurtful or damaging that they should be removed from public access to protect vulnerable individuals.

Additionally, the writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition and allusions, is sometimes heavy-handed and detracts from the overall clarity of the argument. For instance, the repeated use of phrases such as ""many people"" and ""many books"" could be condensed or rephrased for greater impact.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and organization. The writer attempts to address multiple factors, including the hot weather, lack of water, poor road conditions, and the presence of a snake, but fails to provide a cohesive and logical flow of ideas.

One of the strengths of the essay is the inclusion of specific details that support the writer's claims. For example, the writer mentions that the water the cyclist finds tastes like ""battery acid"" (@CAPS1), which effectively conveys the unpleasant taste of the water. Additionally, the writer's description of the poor road conditions, where the cyclist can only travel at 12 mph, adds to the overall sense of frustration and challenge faced by the cyclist.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis and explanation of how these factors interact with each other. For instance, the writer could explore how the hot weather exacerbates the cyclist's thirst and dehydration, or how the poor road conditions affect the cyclist's ability to conserve water. Furthermore, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the snake to stating that the cyclist's major concern is the lack of water, without providing a clear connection between the two.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist.

This lack of infrastructure and human assistance would indeed make it difficult for Joe to get help or find directions, which is a crucial aspect of the essay.

This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, longing, and perseverance that are woven throughout the narrative.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the ""hibiscus"" and ""geese,"" creates a vivid image of the changing seasons and the cyclical nature of life. The mention of the snows melting and the geese returning suggests a return to a sense of normalcy and renewal, which contrasts with the bleakness of winter. This contrast highlights Saeng's emotional state and her desire to move forward.

The author also uses the hibiscus as a symbol of hope and new beginnings. The fact that Saeng plans to take the test again when the hibiscus is budding implies that she sees this as a fresh start, a chance to prove herself and overcome her struggles. This interpretation is supported by the previous sentence, ""She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country,"" which suggests that Saeng was struggling to adapt to her new environment.

Furthermore, the author's use of the phrase ""When they come back"" is significant, as it implies that Saeng is waiting for someone or something to return, which could be a person, a place, or a sense of belonging. This ambiguity adds to the sense of longing and yearning that pervades the narrative.

The writer's primary argument against the benefits of computers is centered around the negative impact on physical health and social interactions. The essay highlights the potential risks of excessive computer use, such as obesity, diabetes, and online safety concerns. However, the writer's tone is often sensationalized, with exaggerated statements and emotional appeals. For instance, the claim that computers are ""worpng machines"" and that they ""pull kids in like a magnet"" is an overstatement. Additionally, the writer's personal anecdote about their friend's experience with a computer is not a reliable example to support their argument.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. Instead, they rely on general statements and assumptions about the effects of computers on children's health and well-being. Furthermore, the writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Do you want your child feeling the wind in their ears"" and ""Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions?"" comes across as manipulative and persuasive rather than a genuine attempt to engage the reader in a thoughtful discussion.

In terms of organization and coherence, the essay is disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The writer jumps between different ideas and topics without a logical flow, making it difficult to follow their argument. The use of transitional phrases and sentences is also limited, which further disrupts the coherence of the essay.

Overall, while the writer raises some valid concerns about the potential risks of excessive computer use, their argument is marred by sensationalism, lack of evidence, and poor organization. A more effective approach would be to present a balanced and nuanced argument, supported by credible sources and a clear structure.

The essay provides a heartwarming and relatable account of the importance of laughter in the writer's life, particularly in their relationship with their nieces. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the transformative power of laughter, showcasing its ability to bring people together and create lasting memories.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's genuine emotions and experiences. The use of vivid descriptions, such as ""I went crazy!"", ""twirling their [toys] back and forth as if [they] were [a character from a song]"", and ""we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our [toys] several times"" effectively conveys the writer's excitement and joy. The writer also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of laughter as a universal language that can bridge cultural and geographical divides, as evident in the line ""I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one"".

However, the essay could benefit from some refinement in terms of organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of laughter to sharing a personal anecdote, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, such as ""I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well"" (should be ""I laugh when I'm sad, and I also laugh when I'm in a great mood"").

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced analysis and supporting evidence to strengthen their argument. While the essay effectively conveys the writer's personal experience, it lacks concrete examples or data to support the claim that laughter is a universal language that can bring people together. A more detailed explanation of the psychological or sociological benefits of laughter would add depth and credibility to the essay.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of laughter and its role in relationships, but could benefit from refinement in terms of organization, coherence, and supporting evidence.

The essay effectively explores the impact of the setting on the cyclist's experience, using vivid descriptions to convey the challenges and emotions evoked by the environment. The author's use of sensory details, such as the ""undesirable heat"" and ""unbearable"" conditions, effectively immerses the reader in the scene. The inclusion of specific examples, like the cyclist's struggle to find water and the feeling of being pursued by a mirage, adds depth to the narrative and highlights the cyclist's physical and emotional state.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the setting's effects. The author primarily focuses on the negative aspects of the environment, without exploring the potential benefits or neutral aspects of the setting. Additionally, some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the essay, such as the sentence ""This sight was troubling."" which seems to be a standalone statement rather than a cohesive part of the narrative.

Furthermore, the writing could improve in terms of grammar, syntax, and sentence structure. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences.

The essay provides a vivid account of the writer's experience at a concert, where they demonstrate patience and understanding. The writer's use of descriptive language effectively conveys their excitement and enthusiasm for the performances. For instance, the writer's description of the lead singer's long beard and afro is a great example of their ability to observe and appreciate the details of the performance. The writer also shows their ability to appreciate different types of music, as they mention enjoying the performances of both unknown and familiar artists.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the first performer to the second, and then to the third, without clear transitions. This makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more nuanced language and more specific examples to support their claims. For example, instead of simply stating that the lead singer was ""great,"" the writer could describe specific aspects of their performance that made them great.

The student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""The mood created by the author is happy"" and ""The author is grateful."" To strengthen the analysis, the student could provide more specific examples from the text to support their claims. For instance, the student could analyze the language used by the author to describe their experiences, such as the use of words like ""love"" and ""sacrifice,"" to illustrate the depth of their emotions.

Additionally, the student could explore the ways in which the author's experiences in the United States and Cuba contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. For example, the student could discuss how the author's experiences with poverty and struggle in the United States contrast with the simplicity and warmth of their life in Cuba, highlighting the author's gratitude for their parents' sacrifices.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more precise and technical vocabulary. For instance, instead of using the phrase ""The author explains,"" the student could use more precise phrases like ""The author states"" or ""The author describes.""

The essay provides a relatable and personal anecdote about the importance of laughter in a relationship. The writer effectively uses specific examples to illustrate their point, making the narrative more engaging and authentic. The inclusion of personal details, such as the writer's nervousness around their partner and the joy of laughing together, adds a touch of warmth and vulnerability to the essay.

However, the writing could benefit from some refinement in terms of organization and coherence.

The student jumps abruptly into discussing the potential problems without providing a clear introduction that establishes the significance of the issue.

The student provides some relevant information about the potential stress on the framework and the cost of modifications, but these points are not fully developed and lack supporting evidence from the excerpt. For instance, the student mentions that the amount of pull would impact the foundation, but does not provide any specific details about the calculations or data that support this claim.

The student also raises valid concerns about safety, citing the flammability of hydrogen gas and the potential for airships to crash into the building due to strong winds.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the existence of differing tastes and opinions among individuals. The writer's own preferences for horror novels and poetry are showcased, demonstrating an understanding of the subjective nature of literary preferences. However, the essay could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of the potential consequences of censorship on the literary landscape.

The writer's argument that people should be able to ignore books or materials they find offensive is a valid point, but it is not fully developed. A more thorough discussion of the potential impact of censorship on the freedom of expression and the role of libraries as a hub for intellectual exploration would strengthen the essay.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more sophisticated sentence structures and vocabulary to elevate the writing quality. The use of phrases such as ""I'm more into horror novels more than anything"" and ""It's very hard to move onto a different series of novels"" could be rephrased for greater clarity and precision.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from further development and refinement to make it more persuasive and effective.

The essay presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries. The writer effectively conveys their stance that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive, citing the importance of protecting individuals' cultural beliefs and the need for a safe and inclusive environment. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to substantiate their claims. The writer's arguments are largely based on general assumptions and lack concrete examples to back up their assertions.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is its lack of organization and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the purpose of libraries to advocating for the removal of offensive materials without providing a clear structure or logical flow. The writing style is also simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of varied vocabulary, which detracts from the overall impact of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments and consider alternative perspectives on the issue. For instance, they do not acknowledge the importance of intellectual freedom and the value of exposing readers to diverse viewpoints, even if they may be challenging or uncomfortable. This lack of consideration for opposing viewpoints undermines the writer's argument and makes their position seem less convincing.

Additionally, the writer's use of language and grammar is not always accurate. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, while the writer presents a clear and relatable perspective on the issue of censorship in libraries, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, evidence, and argumentation. With further development and refinement, the writer has the potential to craft a more compelling and persuasive essay.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of hope, perseverance, and the cyclical nature of life. The author's decision to wait until spring, a season associated with renewal and growth, suggests that she is willing to give herself time to heal and prepare before attempting the test again. This choice also highlights her connection to nature, as she associates the blooming of the hibiscus with her own personal growth and renewal.

The author's use of sensory details, such as the melting snows and the return of the geese, creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, emphasizing the passing of time and the cyclical nature of life. This imagery also serves to underscore Saeng's emotional state, as she is able to find solace in the natural world during a difficult time. Furthermore, the author's decision to wait until spring to take the test again implies that she is willing to take her time and not rush into anything, which is a valuable lesson for readers of all ages.

The author's conclusion also serves to humanize Saeng, making her a more relatable and sympathetic character. By showing her vulnerability and determination, the author creates a sense of empathy in the reader, making the story more engaging and memorable.

The essay presents a well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, citing personal experiences and observations to support the claim. The writer effectively uses rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""@CAPS5"") and allusions to Katherine Paterson's quote, to emphasize their point. The essay also effectively addresses potential counterarguments, acknowledging that some individuals may object to certain materials due to personal opinions.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The writer relies heavily on anecdotal evidence, which may not be representative of the broader context. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more concrete examples and evidence to support the claim that censorship is unfair to students who are unable to access certain materials.

Furthermore, the writer's tone can come across as somewhat confrontational and dismissive of opposing viewpoints. While it is essential to assert one's position, it is equally important to engage with counterarguments in a respectful and constructive manner.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the use of all caps for emphasis (""@CAPS5"") can be distracting and may be perceived as shouting. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more refinement and attention to detail.

The student's essay attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer seems to jump between different points, making it difficult to follow their argument.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific and relevant information from the excerpt. The writer mentions that the engineers looked past the flaws of the mooring mast, but fails to provide any concrete evidence or quotes from the excerpt to support this claim. The writer also makes general statements about the risks associated with hydrogen and helium, but does not provide any specific details or context.

The writer also struggles with organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the risks of hydrogen and helium to talking about the Hindenburg disaster, and then suddenly shifts to discussing the wind currents and the height restrictions for dirigibles. This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

Furthermore, the writer uses informal language and grammatical errors, such as ""probaly"" instead of ""probably"" and ""alwas"" instead of ""always."" This detracts from the overall credibility of the essay.

In terms of supporting evidence, the writer mentions that the back of the ships would swivel around the mooring mast, but fails to provide any specific details or quotes from the excerpt to support this claim. The writer also mentions that Al Smith should have done more studying, but does not provide any context or evidence to support this claim.

Overall, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, struggles with organization and coherence, and relies on general statements and informal language.

The author effectively conveys a warm and inviting mood in the memoir, creating a sense of comfort and love that permeates the narrative. The use of sensory details, such as the ""aromas of the kitchen"" and the ""Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air, effectively transports the reader to the author's childhood home. The author's emphasis on the love and care shown by the surrogate grandparents, Sergio and Edelmira, towards the author and their family members is also noteworthy. The quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" in paragraph @NUM3 serves as a powerful testament to the author's appreciation for the love that was present in the household.

However, the analysis could benefit from more depth and nuance. The author's use of transitional phrases, such as ""If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does!"" and ""This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what,"" feels somewhat generic and could be more specific. Additionally, the author could have explored the complexities and challenges that the author faced in the household, rather than solely focusing on the positive aspects.

Furthermore, the author's writing style is clear and concise, but could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The use of repetition, such as the phrase ""very, very loving,"" becomes somewhat monotonous and detracts from the overall impact of the essay.

The writer effectively conveys their belief that censorship is a threat to individual freedom and the right to access information. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation, relying heavily on simplistic and general statements.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to provide a clear and concise thesis statement, which effectively summarizes the writer's position on the issue. The writer also provides some relevant historical context, referencing the American Revolution and the importance of freedom of speech. Additionally, the inclusion of a quote from Katherine Paterson adds a layer of depth and support to the writer's argument.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer's arguments are often based on general statements and assumptions, rather than concrete evidence or logical reasoning. For example, the writer claims that censorship is a direct violation of the constitution, but fails to provide specific examples or references to support this claim. Furthermore, the writer's argument that censorship is a threat to individual freedom is not fully developed, and the writer does not provide a clear explanation of what they mean by ""freedom.""

The opening quote from Katherine Paterson effectively sets the tone for the essay, highlighting the importance of individual freedom of choice when it comes to reading materials. However, the student's argument is largely based on a simplistic and binary view of censorship, where books are either completely acceptable or completely unacceptable.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of concrete evidence and supporting arguments. The student relies heavily on personal opinions and general statements, such as ""Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read"" and ""We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them."" These statements do not provide any depth or insight into the complexities of the issue. Furthermore, the student's use of phrases such as ""You should get rid of them"" and ""You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books"" comes across as overly prescriptive and didactic.

Additionally, the essay suffers from grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. The writing is often unclear and difficult to follow, making it challenging to understand the student's intended meaning.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement and transitions between paragraphs. The writing jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of individual freedom to making a blanket statement about what to do with offensive books. This lack of cohesion makes the essay feel disjointed and lacking in coherence.
