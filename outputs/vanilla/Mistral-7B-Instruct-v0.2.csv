However, the connection between the two could be more explicitly stated and developed. The essay mentions that the hibiscus is a winter hibiscus, but it does not explain how this relates to Saeng's determination or the significance of the hibiscus in the context of the story. To strengthen the evaluation, the writer could provide specific examples or quotes from the text that illustrate Saeng's determination and how it is reflected in the hibiscus metaphor.

4,10543,"Evaluation: The essay provides two reasons for why the author might have concluded the story with the given paragraph, but the explanations are not clear and lack specific details from the text. The first reason, ""because Saeng had picked up a Winter Hibiscus,"" does not directly relate to the paragraph or the reason for Saeng's determination to retake the test. The second reason, ""so she can also drive when she gets down passing it,"" is also unclear and does not provide any specific evidence from the text. The essay's organization and clarity could be improved by providing more specific examples and details from the story to support each reason.

The writer identifies specific challenges, such as the wind making it difficult to get the dirigible to the top, safety concerns due to a previous dirigible fire, and the potential danger of the dirigibles being too low and popping. However, the essay could benefit from improved organization and sentence structure. For instance, the writer could combine the sentences about the wind and safety concerns into one paragraph, and consider revising the sentence ""The last thing that they had to consider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop"" to make it clearer that the ""they"" refers to the builders and that ""Low"" refers to the height of the dirigibles.

However, it lacks specific details and fails to connect the conclusion of the story to the content of the essay. The essay does not explain why the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to take the test again in the spring. To effectively evaluate this essay, it is necessary to read the entire story and consider how the conclusion relates to the themes and events presented.

The conclusion of the story is significant because it shows Saeng's determination and resilience in the face of adversity. Saeng has failed a test and is disappointed in herself. However, instead of giving up, she makes a promise to herself to try again in the spring. This vow is symbolic of new beginnings and the renewal of life that comes with the melting of the snows and the return of the geese and hibiscus.

The story itself highlights the importance of nature and the passing of the seasons. Saeng and her family spend their days planting and caring for flowers, and the hibiscus is a particular favorite. The budding of the hibiscus in the spring is a sign of renewal and growth, which ties in nicely with Saeng's decision to retake the test.

Therefore, the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring to show her determination and the significance of new beginnings and renewal.

The essay only states that Saeng is saying she will take the test next year, without any elaboration or connection to the content of the story.

To effectively evaluate the essay, it is necessary to first understand the significance of Saeng's vow in the context of the story. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination and resilience in the face of failure. Saeng's decision to retake the test in the spring signifies her belief in her ability to improve and her commitment to achieving her goals. This is a common theme in the story, as Saeng faces numerous challenges but never gives up.

For example, when Saeng first takes the test, she is unprepared and fails. However, instead of being discouraged, she studies harder and makes a plan to retake the test the following year. This determination is further emphasized when she sets a specific goal for herself, choosing the spring as the time when she will retake the test. The author's use of the imagery of the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus adds to the sense of renewal and new beginnings, further highlighting Saeng's commitment to improvement.
