Evaluation:
The essay presents a clear stance on the given statement, with the writer arguing that successful people should not try new things and take risks, as it may lead to failure. However, the writer's reasoning is largely based on a simplistic and overly broad generalization. The phrase ""NO BODY SHOULD SUCCESS COUSING FAIL"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear, and the writer's argument relies heavily on vague statements such as ""IF EVERY BODY DO THE SAME THING"" and ""WHERE IS THE HUMINATATION"". The writer also fails to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claim. Furthermore, the writer's suggestion that someone should not start a company alone is not a relevant example to the original statement, which is about trying new things and taking risks in general.

The writer's writing style is also marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and poor sentence structure. The writer's use of phrases like ""IF SOME BODY WANT TO"" and ""FOR HIM SELF"" is also unclear and awkward.

Overall, while the writer presents a clear stance, their argument is weak and lacks substance, and their writing style is marred by numerous errors.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic, acknowledging both sides of the debate and offering specific reasons to support their stance. They demonstrate a good understanding of the prompt and provide relevant examples to illustrate their points. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in some areas, particularly in the introduction and conclusion. The writing is often simplistic and lacks nuanced vocabulary, which may make it difficult for the reader to fully understand the student's intended meaning. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and a more effective use of evidence to support the argument.

The student's use of sentence structure and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors in verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement. For example, ""First being a specialist is like a goal you can acchieve"" should be ""First being a specialist is like a goal that you can achieve."" Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary, such as ""specialization"" instead of ""spezialize"" and ""influence"" instead of ""influencees"".

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt and provide a thoughtful argument, but could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence-level writing.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. The writer effectively uses specific examples and evidence to support their claim that young people do give enough time to helping their communities. The writer cites relevant data from the Ministry of Education of Korea to demonstrate the increase in community service participation among students, which adds credibility to their argument. Additionally, the writer shares a personal anecdote about their own experience as a volunteer, which helps to illustrate the positive impact of community service on their life and career.

However, the writer could benefit from providing more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the topic. At times, the writing feels a bit simplistic, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the role of schools to the role of societies without fully connecting the two ideas.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that understanding ideas is more important for students than learning facts. The student acknowledges the importance of facts but emphasizes the benefits of understanding ideas, citing personal experiences and examples to support their claim. The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, and the student attempts to address potential counterarguments.

However, the essay is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of clarity, and a lack of concrete evidence to support some of the claims. The writing is often simplistic, and the student relies heavily on vague phrases such as ""it is widely acknowledged"" and ""it is more attractive and fascinating."" The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary and sentence structure is not always effective, leading to awkward phrasing and unclear sentences. For example, the sentence ""It si quite easy for average people to choose learning facts because the several obvious reasons that learning facts is more interesting, is easier and so on"" is difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and word choice.

Despite these issues, the essay demonstrates a clear and coherent argument, and the student shows a good understanding of the topic. With further refinement and attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, the essay could be significantly improved.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" The writer effectively uses various reasons and examples to support their claim, including the development of new technology, the potential for alternative modes of transportation, and the growing awareness of environmental concerns. However, the essay lacks concrete evidence and specific details to back up these claims, and the writing often suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. The writer's tone is also somewhat inconsistent, veering between confidence and uncertainty.

The essay's organization is generally clear, with three main paragraphs that address the potential disappearance of cars due to technological advancements, the reduction of toxic gases, and the growing awareness of environmental concerns. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the writer could benefit from more cohesive linking phrases to connect their ideas.

One of the essay's strengths is its ability to engage the reader and present a clear argument. The writer's passion for the topic is evident, and their enthusiasm is infectious. However, the writing could benefit from more refinement and attention to detail to elevate the overall quality of the essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the topic, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of having broad knowledge versus specializing in one subject. However, the essay lacks coherence, organization, and grammatical accuracy, which are essential for effective communication. The student's writing style is informal, with frequent use of abbreviations, misspellings, and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's arguments are also somewhat vague and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that having broad knowledge is beneficial at the primary, secondary, and high school levels, but fail to provide specific examples or explanations to justify this statement. Similarly, their argument that specializing in one or two subjects is beneficial at the university level is also unsupported by concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, such as ""I belive"" instead of ""I believe"", ""generical"" instead of ""general"", ""everythihg"" instead of ""everything"", and ""ours"" instead of ""our"". These errors undermine the student's credibility and make it difficult to take their arguments seriously.

In conclusion, while the student demonstrates a willingness to engage with the topic, their writing quality and argumentation skills need significant improvement.

The essay presents a clear stance on the given statement, but it lacks depth and coherence in supporting the argument. The writer's primary focus is on the idea that helping others is beneficial for the individual, but this perspective is not directly related to the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer's use of simplistic language and lack of concrete examples weakens the overall argument. Furthermore, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, which makes the writing seem unengaging.

The writer's statement that ""good friends are good communities, good communities are helping your life forever"" is an interesting idea, but it is not a convincing reason to support the original statement. The writer's conclusion that ""helping people those people help back to you"" is also unclear and does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claim.

To strengthen the essay, the writer should provide more specific examples and evidence to support their argument, and focus on addressing the original statement directly. Additionally, the writer should work on varying sentence structure and using more sophisticated vocabulary to improve the overall coherence and effectiveness of the writing.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects over specializing in one specific subject. The essay is well-organized, and the writer effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the writing to a higher level.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument. The anecdote about the writer's experience in Grade 11, where they took multiple courses to broaden their knowledge, is a good example of how this approach can help individuals discover their passions. Additionally, the writer's suggestion to read different sections of the newspaper to gain knowledge from various subjects is a practical and relevant example.

However, the writing lacks depth and nuance in several areas. The writer relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""having more knowledge broadens our horizons"" and ""it's essential to have a broad background in politics to understand business changes."" These statements are true, but they do not provide much insight or analysis. Furthermore, the writer's arguments are not always well-supported, and some points, such as the claim that having broad knowledge makes it easier to socialize with people from different backgrounds, are not explicitly explained.

The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""I wans't"" instead of ""I wasn't,"" and ""uniquness"" instead of ""uniqueness."" Additionally, the writer uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks variety in their vocabulary.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument against the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The writer effectively uses three main points to support their opinion, which are experience, time, and the higher possibility of success. 

However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence for each point. The writer mainly relies on general statements and lacks concrete examples to illustrate their arguments. For instance, the writer states that experience helps people make better decisions, but they do not provide any specific examples to support this claim. Similarly, the writer mentions that a person who already knows a job well can spend more time to make it perfect, but they do not provide any evidence to back up this statement.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is simple and lacks variety. The essay consists mainly of short sentences and lacks transitional phrases, which makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The writer also uses some grammatical errors, such as ""he can usually make the best decision"" and ""he can easily make a wrong or worse decision"", which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."" The writer effectively uses personal experiences and examples from their martial arts background and the introduction of Microsoft Windows as operating systems to support their claim. The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive language helps to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are areas where the writer could improve.

The writer mentions the increasing popularity and affordability of cars, as well as the convenience of owning a car, which are valid reasons for the continued growth of the car population. Additionally, the writer touches on the environmental concerns and the potential shortage of natural resources, such as oil, which could lead to a continued demand for cars. However, the essay lacks a clear and convincing thesis statement, and the writer's arguments are not well-organized and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. The writer also makes several grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (e.g., ""tweny"", ""bz"", ""simplz""), which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity, with phrases such as ""Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny years"" and ""become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car.""

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of traveling in a group led by a tour guide. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and examples to support their claim, making the essay more engaging and relatable.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to illustrate their points.

Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""Secondly"" and ""Last but not least,"" helps to organize the essay and make it easier to follow.

However, there are several areas where the writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks cohesion and coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of making friends to the benefits of having a tour guide, and then to the benefits of having fun. A more logical connection between these ideas would strengthen the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure are not always accurate.

The student's writing is largely simplistic, and some sentences are worded in a way that is easy to understand but lacks precision. For instance, the sentence ""If students learn only facts then they don't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical"" could be rephrased to ""If students only learn facts, they lack the conceptual understanding that enables them to apply their knowledge in practical situations.""

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the writing seem a bit flat. Incorporating more complex sentence structures, such as compound or compound-complex sentences, can add depth and interest to the writing.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, the sentence ""For every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it"" should be rephrased to ""For every problem, there is a concept behind it that needs to be solved.""

The student's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against the idea of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. They effectively use specific reasons and examples to support their stance, such as the competitive job market and the importance of specialization in a specific field. The student also acknowledges the value of general knowledge and provides a balanced perspective, recognizing the need for some knowledge of various subjects.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as some sentences are simplistic and lack clarity. Additionally, the student relies heavily on clichés, such as the ""Jack of all, King of none"" quote, which, although familiar, does not add much originality to the argument. Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more concrete evidence and supporting details to strengthen the student's claims.

The student's personal anecdote about their experience as a software engineer is a good example of how specialization can lead to success, but it is not a comprehensive argument to support the broader claim. The essay could also benefit from more exploration of the potential drawbacks of broad knowledge, such as the difficulty in standing out in a crowded job market.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, but could benefit from more sophisticated language, originality, and supporting evidence.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in support of the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The writer effectively uses three valid points to substantiate their claim, including the increasing use of alternative modes of transportation, the rise of remote work, and the scarcity of fuel.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions the growing use of alternative modes of transportation, but fails to provide specific examples or statistics to back up this assertion. Similarly, the writer's argument about the scarcity of fuel is based on a general trend, but does not provide any concrete data or projections to support this claim.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""convinient"" instead of ""convenient"", ""transporatation"" instead of ""transportation"", and ""eg. Software firms"" instead of ""e.g. software firms"". These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

Additionally, the writer's tone is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for an academic essay. The writer also makes a sweeping statement that ""it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important inventions of human history"", which is an exaggeration and lacks objectivity.

Overall, while the essay provides a clear and well-structured argument, it lacks depth, nuance, and academic rigor. The writer needs to improve their writing skills, provide more concrete evidence, and adopt a more formal tone to produce a high-quality essay.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in response to the prompt, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence to convincingly substantiate the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer attempts to address various factors that may influence the enjoyment of life, such as physical limitations, responsibilities, and financial concerns. However, the analysis is often superficial and lacks concrete examples to support the claims.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences, such as ""Let's analyze them"" and ""We also have to notice,"" adds to the essay's clarity, but it also indicates a lack of sophisticated sentence structures and vocabulary. The writer's writing style is straightforward and lacks nuance, which may make the essay feel somewhat simplistic.

One of the major issues with the essay is the writer's failure to provide a clear and well-supported thesis statement. The writer's argument is more of a series of loosely connected points rather than a cohesive and focused argument. The writer also struggles to effectively address counterarguments, which weakens the overall argument.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points or reiterate the thesis statement. The writer's final sentence, ""But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can?"" feels like a non-sequitur and does not contribute to the overall argument.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on general statements and clichés. The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples and anecdotes to support their argument. The use of historical figures like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln adds credibility to the student's claim. However, the student fails to provide a more detailed analysis of these examples, instead relying on brief summaries.

The essay provides a clear and thoughtful response to the prompt, but it suffers from several issues that hinder its overall effectiveness. The writer acknowledges the complexity of the question and attempts to address it by providing a nuanced discussion of the factors that influence young people's willingness to help their communities. However, the essay's structure and coherence are marred by several problems.

The writer's decision to define the terms ""nowadays"" and ""helping their communities"" is a good starting point, but it is not fully developed. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the differences between young people in the past and present to making a general statement about the nature of young people's behavior. The writer also fails to provide concrete examples to support their claims, which makes it difficult to fully understand their argument.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often unclear and lacks precision. For instance, the sentence ""When you live in a small town you can for example help your neighboor with his garden when he is not at home and you are more likely to do that kind of thing just because you know very well"" is difficult to understand due to the use of the word ""neighboor"" instead of ""neighbor."" Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat vague and does not effectively summarize their main points.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, agreeing that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer offers a relevant example from the business world, using Coca Cola as a case study to illustrate their point. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete data to substantiate their claims. Additionally, there are grammatical errors, such as ""becuase"" instead of ""because,"" ""porfit"" instead of ""profit,"" and ""produvct"" instead of ""product."" The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and provides no evidence to support their claim that successful businesses take more risks to gain more profit. Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often unclear and lacks cohesion.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the history of McDonald's and the book ""Le Papillon"" to support their claim. The writer also uses transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas, making the essay flow smoothly.

One of the strengths of the essay is the way the writer uses concrete examples to illustrate their points. The writer provides specific details about McDonald's history, such as the introduction of the ""Drive-Thru"" concept, and how it became a successful innovation. Similarly, the writer uses the story of the protagonists in ""Le Papillon"" to demonstrate how taking risks can lead to success. The writer also uses rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""trying new things"", ""taking risks"") to emphasize the importance of innovation.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. The writer could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. At times, the writing is quite simplistic, and some sentences are worded in a way that is hard to understand. For example, the sentence ""It is not arguable that if one wants to be successful, one must seek for new things so that one can be differed from usual and common people"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several errors in the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, the sentence ""The owner of Mc.

Additionally, the writer raises valid points about the negative consequences of excessive advertising, including the loss of trust in companies and the potential harm to society. However, the writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (e.g., ""excesive advertisement"") and emotive language (e.g., ""I gave up the using the machine""), adds to the persuasive power of the essay.

The essay provides a clear and personal perspective on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer attempts to support their argument with specific examples from their own life and that of their grandfather, which adds a relatable and engaging element to the essay. However, the writing is marred by several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. The writer also struggles with sentence structure and coherence, which makes it difficult to follow their train of thought at times.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples to support their argument. The anecdote about their grandfather's experiences during the Second World War is a powerful illustration of how experience can shape one's perspective and provide a sense of resilience. However, the writer could have developed this idea further by providing more context and analysis.

The writer also raises some valid points about the benefits of age and experience, such as the ability to make more informed and rational choices. However, these points are not fully developed and could be supported with more evidence and examples.

Overall, while the essay shows promise, it requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, and coherence. With further practice and attention to detail, the writer has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The student identifies three main reasons to support this claim, which are the primary purpose of advertising, the presentation of flaws in advertisements, and the tendency to highlight only the benefits of a product. The student provides specific examples to illustrate these points, such as the case of skin creams and phone contracts, which demonstrate how advertisements often downplay or omit important information.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. The student's arguments are largely based on general observations and examples, but they could be strengthened by more in-depth research and critical thinking. For instance, the student could have explored the psychological and marketing strategies behind these tactics, or considered alternative perspectives on the role of advertising in shaping consumer perceptions.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated sentence structures and vocabulary. The student's writing is clear, but it is often simplistic and lacks variety. The use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices could also improve the essay's coherence and flow.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some effective arguments, but the essay could benefit from more depth, analysis, and refinement.

The essay provides a clear and straightforward opinion on the statement, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence. The writer mainly focuses on the benefits of being young, such as having more free time and being able to enjoy life without responsibilities. However, the essay fails to provide concrete examples and evidence to substantiate these claims. The writer also makes some general statements about older people, such as being more mature and stressed, without providing specific reasons or examples to support these claims. Furthermore, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures.

The writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""In conclusion"" and ""To be a young person is beautiful,"" is also not effective in connecting the ideas and providing a cohesive argument. The writer's tone is also somewhat inconsistent, veering between a casual, conversational tone and a more formal, persuasive tone.

The student's essay provides some relevant examples to support their opinion that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. However, the essay lacks a clear and structured argument, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence to substantiate their claims.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, arguing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer identifies several reasons to support this claim, including the lack of negative information in advertisements, the focus on visual effects to attract consumers, and the potential for consumers to be misled. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and specific examples to strengthen its arguments. Additionally, the writer could have explored the implications of this issue more thoroughly, discussing potential consequences for consumers and the advertising industry as a whole. Furthermore, the writing could be more polished, with more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, and more precise vocabulary.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, which can make the essay feel disjointed at times. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""In addition, due to the improvements in computer technology consumers are being attracted by the visional effects by the sector, hence they assume that the product is suitable for them or the product is as good as the advertisement"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement that it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence in its reasoning, with some sentences appearing to be disconnected from the rest of the argument. The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear and relevant examples to support the student's claims. While the student attempts to provide some examples, they are often vague and do not effectively illustrate the points being made. For instance, the example of the painting by Van Gogh is not well-developed and does not clearly demonstrate the student's point about the importance of understanding ideas and concepts.

Additionally, the essay relies heavily on simplistic and general statements, such as ""For most of human beings, the ability to learn facts is much stronger than that of understanding ideas and concepts."" This type of statement does not provide any concrete evidence to support the student's argument and comes across as overly simplistic.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on abbreviations and misspellings (e.g., ""definitly"" instead of ""definitely,"" ""cencepts"" instead of ""concepts,"" and ""acdemic"" instead of ""academic""). This can make it difficult for the reader to follow the student's argument and understand the complexity of their ideas.

Despite these issues, the student does raise some valid points about the importance of understanding ideas and concepts in certain subjects, such as math, calculation, science, history, and social science. However, these points are not well-developed and could be more effectively supported with more concrete examples and evidence.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of specialization. The student effectively uses specific examples from their own experience and cultural context to support their claim. The use of a relevant Turkish proverb, ""Instead of knowing something else about every subject, knowing everything of one subject is better,"" adds a layer of depth to the essay and demonstrates the student's understanding of the cultural nuances of their native language.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. The student's writing is often simplistic, and some sentences lack clarity. For instance, the sentence ""The need and requirements of academical environment is changing"" could be rephrased to ""The academic environment is undergoing significant changes."" Additionally, the student's use of transitional phrases, such as ""In conclusion,"" feels somewhat abrupt and could be integrated more smoothly into the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. For example, the sentence ""The another point that I am considering as an advantage of specialization is"" could be rephrased to ""Another point that I would like to highlight is."" The student also uses the phrase ""I w'll be able to give accurate responses"" which is a non-standard way of writing.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a clear and well-supported argument in favor of specialization, and their use of specific examples and cultural references adds depth to the essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of traveling in a group led by a tour guide. The student effectively uses specific examples from their personal experience to support their points, making their argument more convincing. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved. The student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument in support of the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay is divided into three main points, each with a clear and concise explanation. The writer effectively uses examples and evidence to substantiate their claims, such as the government's investment in public transportation, the increasing cost of crude oil, and the growing concern for environmental protection.

However, the writer's writing is marred by several issues. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer seems to agree with the statement without providing a clear explanation of why they hold this view. Additionally, the writing is often simplistic and lacks nuanced analysis. For example, the writer states that the government's investment in public transportation will lead to fewer cars being purchased, but fails to explain how this will actually happen.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary and sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety. For example, the sentence ""Most of the people in our city buy cars because there are so few public bus and subways"" could be rephrased to ""Many people in our city rely on cars because of the limited public transportation options."" The writer also relies heavily on general statements such as ""the people's conception to protect the environment"" which is not a clear or concise way to express their point.

Finally, the writer's conclusion is overly simplistic and fails to summarize the main points effectively. The writer states that ""All in all, the governments' action, the limited natural resources, and the mind of people to decline the pollution all put functions in the reducted number of cars."" This sentence is unclear and fails to provide a clear summary of the main points.

The student also provides relevant examples from their university life, such as the leisure sports department, to demonstrate how having a broad knowledge base can lead to a more enjoyable and enriching campus experience.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. At times, the student's writing appears to be somewhat simplistic, and some sentences lack clarity and coherence.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on general statements and simplistic comparisons. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the essay.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of technology to making a sweeping statement about young people enjoying life more than older people. A stronger thesis statement would have provided a clearer direction for the essay and helped to organize the writer's ideas more effectively.

Additionally, the writer relies too heavily on clichéd phrases and sentences, such as ""In these days"" and ""for example.""

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. They acknowledge the importance of both understanding ideas and concepts, as well as learning facts, and offer specific examples to support their stance. The student's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices, such as ""if,"" ""but,"" and ""so,"" demonstrates a good understanding of sentence-level grammar and cohesion.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary, as some sentences are quite simplistic and lack precision. For instance, the phrase ""it is more important for a student to understand why the world wars had occurred than the specific facts and dates linked to war's history"" could be rephrased to ""it is more important for a student to comprehend the underlying causes of the world wars than to memorize specific dates and events."" Additionally, the student's use of sentence-level grammar and syntax could be improved, with some sentences feeling a bit disjointed or wordy.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more effective use of textual evidence to support the student's claims. While the student provides some relevant examples, they are not always clearly linked to the main argument. For instance, the discussion of Kant's theory feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The essay is divided into three main points, each supported by specific examples from the writer's personal experiences with advertisements. The writer effectively uses concrete evidence to substantiate their claims, making their argument more convincing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples that illustrate the points they are making.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their own life and from the example of Bill Gates, a well-known successful entrepreneur. The student's use of specific details, such as the amount of money saved by automating the payment authorization form and the promotion they received, adds weight to their argument.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of specializing in one specific subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The writer effectively uses specific examples and anecdotes to support their claim, such as the example of students being directed to specific courses by their teachers in developed countries. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on general statements and clichés. For instance, the writer states that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a ""big loose"" for a person, which is a vague and overly simplistic expression. Additionally, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claim that specializing in one subject leads to better job prospects and a more fulfilling career.

Furthermore, the writer's argument is not entirely convincing, as it relies on a narrow and overly individualistic perspective. The writer assumes that the benefits of specialization are universal and applicable to all individuals, without considering the potential benefits of having a broad range of knowledge and skills. The writer also fails to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of specialization, such as the risk of becoming overly narrow-minded or limited in one's perspectives.

However, the essay lacks a clear and strong thesis statement that ties the entire argument together. Additionally, some sentences are worded vaguely, such as ""it is much more dangerous for old people to walk outside if it is cold"" which could be rephrased for clarity. Furthermore, the student could have explored the topic more deeply, providing more nuanced and detailed examples to support their claims.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured response to the prompt, addressing both sides of the argument and offering relevant examples to support their stance. However, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of cohesion, and inadequate sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic sentence constructions, such as ""i think that"" and ""i am not agree."" Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement and transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides relevant examples to support their argument, such as the concept of peace and the importance of understanding history.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument against the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The writer effectively uses specific examples to support their claim, such as the comparison between the perfect conditions in advertisements and the real-life scenarios of the writer's daily life. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on simplistic and obvious examples. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, instead relying on general statements and assumptions. Furthermore, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. The writer's tone is also somewhat inconsistent, veering between a casual, conversational tone and a more formal, argumentative tone.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer seems to be arguing against the statement, but the argument is not clearly articulated or supported. The writer also fails to provide a clear roadmap for the essay, instead jumping between different ideas and examples without a clear logical flow. Additionally, the writer's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs is weak, making the essay feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these issues, the writer does demonstrate some understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples. The writer's observation about the perfect conditions in advertisements and the real-life scenarios is a good starting point for further analysis. However, the writer fails to take this observation further, instead relying on simplistic and obvious examples.

The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic sentence structures. For instance, the sentence ""We usually watch flying cars in the movies. Hower, it is just movie"" should be rephrased as ""We often see flying cars in movies, but they are just fictional.""

However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, with some sentences feeling disconnected from each other. The student also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples to support their argument.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as verb tense inconsistencies, incorrect use of prepositions, and awkward sentence constructions. For instance, the sentence ""In my opinion, a group does not need a guide to help him"" is unclear and should be rephrased to ""In my opinion, a group does not need a guide to help us."" Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases is limited, making the essay feel disjointed. The student also fails to address potential counterarguments to their claim, which weakens their overall argument. 

The student does, however, provide some relevant examples to support their argument, such as their personal experience of traveling in Spain without a guide. This anecdote is engaging and helps to illustrate their point, but it is not enough to sustain a convincing argument. The student also raises a valid point about the increasing availability of information online, which could be seen as a counterargument to the need for a guide. However, this point is not fully developed and could be explored further.

Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, grammar, and argumentation, but it does demonstrate some potential for growth.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of prioritizing the understanding of ideas and concepts over learning facts. The student effectively uses relevant examples, such as the invention of the telephone and the discovery of alternative fuels, to support their claim. The essay also touches on the importance of critical thinking and experimentation in the learning process.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. The student relies heavily on simple sentences and lacks varied vocabulary, which may make the writing seem less engaging and less polished. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""these days the technology has developed, new things are been invented this is only because of the main reason that is logical thinking about some thing."" This sentence could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. At times, the student jumps abruptly from one example to another without clear transitions, which can make the essay feel disjointed. For instance, the discussion of the invention of the telephone and the discovery of alternative fuels feels somewhat disconnected from the main argument.

Finally, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar and mechanics. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""do not"" instead of ""don't"" and ""referring"" instead of ""referencing.""

Overall, while the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and presents some compelling arguments, the writing could benefit from more attention to language, organization, and mechanics.

The student's essay provides a clear and passionate stance on the topic, with a strong opening sentence that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. However, the writing quality is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide specific examples to support the argument. The student's use of phrases such as ""i totally disagree"" and ""i think"" is also overly simplistic and lacks academic rigor.

The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the negative impact of advertisements to proposing a solution, without a clear logical connection between the two ideas. The student's suggestion of establishing a special place to check the accuracy of advertisements is an interesting idea, but it is not fully developed and lacks concrete evidence to support its feasibility.

Furthermore, the essay relies heavily on emotional appeals, with phrases such as ""it's not nice to see a friend fall into this situation"" and ""why do they such lie about stupid things"". While these emotions can be persuasive, they do not contribute to a well-structured and well-supported argument.

The student's writing style is also characterized by a lack of vocabulary and sentence structure variety, with many short, simple sentences that do not engage the reader. The use of abbreviations such as ""i"" and ""it's"" is also distracting and detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, while the student's passion and conviction are evident, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of writing quality, coherence, and academic rigor.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer effectively uses specific reasons and examples to support their claim, such as the fact that young people are more active, have more free time, and are more open to new experiences. However, the essay also raises some valid points about the responsibilities and obligations that older people face, which could be seen as limiting their ability to enjoy life.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and articulate the advantages of being young, such as the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the discovery of new things. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the counterarguments. For example, the writer mentions that older people have obligations, but does not fully explore the ways in which these obligations can actually enhance one's life, such as the sense of purpose and fulfillment that comes from building a career and raising a family.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not fully address the complexity of the issue. The statement ""In my opinion, young people enjoy the present instead older people enjoy on a long time"" is unclear and does not provide a satisfying resolution to the debate.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some strong arguments in favor of the statement. However, it could benefit from more depth, analysis, and attention to detail to make a more convincing case.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know. The writer effectively uses examples from various fields, such as construction and science, to support their claim. The use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices, such as ""So,"" ""And,"" and ""Not only,"" helps to connect ideas and make the text flow smoothly.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. Some sentences are worded in a simplistic manner, and the writer relies heavily on general statements without providing concrete evidence to back up their claims. For instance, the statement ""successful people usually come from many failures and risks and after overcoming all this situations they gain success"" is a broad assertion that could be supported with more specific examples.

Additionally, the writer could have explored the potential drawbacks of taking risks and the importance of learning from failures. While the essay highlights the benefits of taking risks, it does not discuss the potential consequences of failure, such as financial loss or emotional distress. This omission weakens the overall argument and makes it less convincing.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often repetitive, with similar phrases and sentences used throughout the essay. For example, the phrase ""successful people"" is used multiple times, and the writer could have varied their language to create more interest and variety.

The student's essay raises some valid points regarding the differences between young and old people, but it lacks coherence, organization, and depth in its argumentation. The essay's structure is simplistic, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and a failure to address the prompt directly. The student also struggles with vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is its failure to provide concrete evidence to support the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The student's arguments are based on general assumptions and stereotypes, rather than specific examples or data. For instance, the statement that young people have more freedom and can enjoy a night out without restriction is not supported by any evidence, and the claim that older people are solely responsible for their own financial well-being is overly simplistic.

Furthermore, the essay's tone is often informal and lacks academic rigor. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""inportant"" and ""culb,"" detracts from the essay's credibility. Additionally, the student's writing style is often unclear and difficult to follow, with long, rambling sentences that fail to convey a clear message.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer effectively uses specific examples to support their claim, such as the example of the child who was disappointed with the toy because it did not match the image presented in the advertisement. This example illustrates the power of advertisements in shaping consumer perceptions and desires.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions that ""many enterprises invest huge amounts of money in advertisements,"" but fails to provide specific data or statistics to back up this assertion.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. The writer acknowledges the opposing viewpoint and presents two main reasons to support their stance that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. The first reason, based on the writer's personal experience and the example of a young man who has benefited from good education, is a good starting point. However, the second reason, which highlights the writer's own employment and financial stability, feels somewhat tenuous and lacks concrete evidence to support the claim that this automatically translates to a willingness to help the community.

Moreover, the writer could have delved deeper into the complexities of the issue, exploring potential counterarguments and nuances that might challenge their stance. For instance, they could have discussed the fact that some young people may be busy with family or other responsibilities, or that they may not have the necessary skills or resources to make a significant impact in their communities. Additionally, the writer's use of phrases such as ""I believe"" and ""I think"" can make the essay feel somewhat subjective and lacking in authority.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical and stylistic errors throughout the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward phrasing. For example, ""Lets take an example of a young man who has faced difficulties in his childhood because of lack of good schools in his village"" should be ""Let's take an example of a young man who faced difficulties in his childhood because of the lack of good schools in his village.""

The essay provides some interesting points to consider when evaluating the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, the writer's arguments are often vague and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that ""every one has his own value about life and different values lead to a compeletely different way of life,"" but this statement is too general and does not provide any specific examples to back it up. Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""it seems like"" and ""in stead of"" is not grammatically correct and detract from the overall coherence of the essay.

Additionally, the writer's arguments are often based on stereotypes and oversimplify complex issues. For example, the writer suggests that older people are more practical and responsible, but this is not necessarily true for all older people. Similarly, the writer implies that young people are more carefree and hedonistic, but this is not a universal characteristic of young people.

Despite these criticisms, the writer does raise some valid points, such as the importance of cultural and societal factors in shaping people's attitudes towards life. The writer is also correct that age can be an important factor in certain cultures, and that older people may have different priorities and values than younger people.

The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of trying new things to the importance of being a creative person in modern society, without providing a cohesive link between the two ideas.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary and sentence structure is limited, with frequent repetition of words such as ""nomal"" and ""new"".

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic of whether most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer effectively uses specific examples from their country's insurance industry to support their claim, demonstrating an understanding of the tactics used in post-modern advertising. The writer also raises a valid point about the psychological methods employed by advertisements to tempt people into purchasing products.

However, the essay lacks depth and analysis in its discussion of the topic. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions that insurance companies in their country use visual advertisements to make products seem better, but fails to provide a detailed explanation of how this is done. Additionally, the writer's argument is not well-supported by logical reasoning, as they simply state that advertisements make products seem better without providing a clear explanation of why this is the case.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often unclear and awkward, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""It is not telling about utility or any other practical values but depicting beauty merely"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of supporting evidence. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear and specific examples to support the writer's claims. The writer mentions that young people have more energy and spirit to take risks and have fun, but fails to provide concrete examples to illustrate this point. Similarly, the writer's assertion that money is the most important factor in enjoying life is not supported by any evidence or examples.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks nuance.

For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of a tour guide to stating that they prefer traveling with a guide over reading a book. Furthermore, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""if I would have the chance to experiment the same situation, I would not have second thoghts about paying a tour guide again.""

The writer's argument that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is a common and relatable perspective, especially for students who are still in the early stages of their academic journey. However, upon closer examination, the essay reveals several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and coherence.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer introduces the topic and provides some supporting points, but fails to explicitly state their position on the statement. This makes it challenging for the reader to understand the writer's main argument and follow their reasoning. For instance, the writer mentions that ""having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever"" but does not clearly explain how this point supports their initial claim.

Furthermore, the essay lacks concrete evidence to support the writer's argument. The writer provides some anecdotal examples from their own experience as an undergraduate student, but these examples are not representative of the broader context. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments, which would have strengthened their position. For example, they could have discussed the potential drawbacks of having broad knowledge, such as the difficulty in mastering a specific subject in-depth.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is often unclear and lacks precision. For instance, the writer uses the term ""undergradutate"" instead of ""undergraduate,"" and ""pre-pharmacy degree"" instead of ""pre-pharmacy program."" These errors detract from the writer's credibility and make it harder to understand their argument.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to discussing the limitations of having broad knowledge. The writer could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas more smoothly.

Overall, while the writer demonstrates some understanding of the topic, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and coherence.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, acknowledging that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, but also highlighting the complexities of the issue. The writer offers specific reasons, such as the effects of globalization and the lack of community institutions, to support their argument. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more nuanced analysis of the issues. The writer also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""most of them"" and ""the most,"" which can make the text feel somewhat vague. Furthermore, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay, as it jumps abruptly from discussing the responsibility of young people to their personal experience in a village.

The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some relevant examples, such as the example of the village in Germany. However, the writing could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar, vocabulary, and clarity. For instance, the writer uses the phrase ""the processe of globalization"" which should be ""the process of globalization."" Additionally, the writer's use of the word ""suprinsing"" should be ""surprising."" The writer also uses some idiomatic expressions, such as ""to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event on eastern,"" which may not be immediately clear to non-native speakers.

The writer provides specific examples, such as the restriction of cars in city centers and the Italian government's tax on ecologically dangerous cars, to support their points. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, and the writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete evidence to back up their claims. Additionally, there are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with many words and phrases being repeated or used incorrectly. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""it is undoubtedly true"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English, and ""i.e."" is not used correctly. The writer also uses the phrase ""grassroots people"" which is not a common expression in English. Furthermore, the writer's sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, which makes the essay feel flat and unengaging.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. The student effectively uses personal examples, such as their father's research on synapses, to illustrate the importance of combining factual knowledge with conceptual understanding. The essay also provides a relevant example from the political system, highlighting the limitations of mere factual knowledge in fostering innovation and creativity.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary, as well as more precise and detailed explanations.

The student also uses a range of vocabulary, including words like ""huge"", ""willingly"", and ""varied"", which demonstrates their ability to use language effectively.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. At times, their sentences are simple and lack variety, which can make the text feel a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""There is a huge amount of youth groups covering all ages and interests which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, the sentence ""By coming together they foster the community, some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part and the profit is being donated to local institutions"" should be rephrased to ""By coming together, they foster the community, and some arrange public events like summer parties, where everybody can take part, and the profit is donated to local institutions.""

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides some effective examples to support their argument. However, their writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. They offer specific reasons and examples to support their stance that older people enjoy life more than younger people. The student highlights the struggles and hardships faced by older individuals, such as rebuilding their world after wars, working hard to provide for their families, and appreciating the value of their lives. They also contrast this with the carefree and superficial approach of younger people who prioritize fun and entertainment without a sense of purpose.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs. The writing is often simplistic and lacks varied sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow at times. Additionally, some sentences are grammatically incorrect or contain errors in punctuation and spelling.

The student also relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""they might look like they are still only working"" and ""who's more enjoying life?"" These statements do not add much depth or insight to the argument and detract from the overall coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would provide a clearer and more compelling final thought that leaves the reader with something to think about.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates a clear and well-intentioned argument, it requires significant improvement in terms of language, organization, and analysis.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The writer effectively uses relevant examples and supporting points to substantiate their claim, such as the importance of developing oneself in different fields to compete in a crowded world. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on general statements and clichés. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use transitional phrases and cohesive devices to connect their ideas, such as ""To begin with,"" ""In addition to this,"" and ""All things considered."" However, these devices are often used in a superficial way, without fully developing the ideas they introduce. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to support their claims, instead relying on vague statements such as ""people are in need of various informations"" and ""the most important weapon in this competition is having broad knowledge.""

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks sophistication, with repetitive phrases such as ""Today being"" and ""Therefore."" The use of grammatical errors, such as ""knowladge"" and ""procces,"" also detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In conclusion, while the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and provides some effective arguments, the essay falls short in terms of depth, analysis, and writing quality.

The essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer presents both sides of the argument, acknowledging the benefits of youth, such as having more freedom and opportunities, but also highlighting the advantages of older age, like having more life experience and a more peaceful lifestyle. The inclusion of personal anecdotes, like the writer's grandmother's experiences, adds a touch of authenticity to the essay.

However, the essay lacks a clear and structured argument. The writer jumps between ideas and fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that young people have more freedom, but then immediately contradicts this by saying they have to work hard and have no time for leisure activities. Similarly, the writer implies that older people have more power, but then notes that they may not be able to keep up with younger people.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simplistic and lacks cohesion. The sentences are often short and lack variety, making the essay feel disjointed and hard to follow. The writer also relies heavily on general statements, such as ""older people can living peacefuly"" and ""young people have to working hard,"" without providing specific examples to support these claims.

Additionally, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments to their position. For example, they do not consider the possibility that older people may have more life experience and wisdom, which could be valuable assets in certain situations.

Overall, while the essay provides some interesting insights, it requires significant improvement in terms of structure, evidence, and writing style.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument on the topic, with the writer presenting three reasons to support their stance that advertisements often make products seem better than they really are. However, the writer's writing skills and use of language are limited, which affects the overall coherence and effectiveness of the essay.

One of the major issues with the essay is the writer's lack of clear and concise sentence structure. Many sentences are short and simple, which makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, the sentence ""One reason is to make lot of money"" is not a complete sentence and should be rephrased to ""One reason is to make a lot of money."" Additionally, the writer often uses incorrect verb tenses, such as ""She wanted to buy a computer fotr that price"" which should be ""She wanted to buy a computer for that price.""

Furthermore, the writer's vocabulary is limited, with many words and phrases being used incorrectly or out of context. For instance, the phrase ""beacuse"" should be spelled ""because,"" and ""maore"" should be spelled ""more."" The writer also uses colloquial expressions, such as ""my grandfather"" and ""my mother,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

Despite these issues, the writer provides some relevant examples to support their argument. The anecdote about the writer's grandfather and mother is a good example of how advertisements can be misleading, and the writer's use of specific details helps to make their argument more convincing.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument against the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the car industry to support their claim, highlighting the tendency of advertisement makers to emphasize the positive aspects of a product while downplaying its negative aspects. The writer also acknowledges that this phenomenon is not unique to the car industry, but rather a common practice in advertising in general.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the statement. At times, the writer's arguments feel somewhat simplistic, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Additionally, the writer could have explored more counterarguments to strengthen their position. Nevertheless, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some valuable insights into the world of advertising.

One area for improvement is in providing more concrete evidence to support the writer's claims.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument against the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The essay begins by explaining the root of the word ""advertisement"" and its primary goal, which is to draw attention. The writer then provides historical context, highlighting how advertisements have evolved over time, from simple product features and customer testimonials to more sophisticated and complex methods that create a false image of a product.

The writer provides several specific examples to support their argument, such as the use of implicit associations between product types and behaviors, celebrity endorsements, and the creation of a ""brand"" that can make a product seem more desirable than it actually is. These examples demonstrate the writer's understanding of the ways in which advertisements can manipulate consumer perceptions and create a false sense of value.

However, the writer's argument is not without its flaws. At times, the writing is overly simplistic, and the sentences could be more complex and nuanced. Additionally, the writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""such techniques ensure that consumers and the manufacturing companies ignore what is really important - the product, and not it's aura."" This statement could be more specific and supported with concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The writer states that they ""strongly believe"" that advertisements make a product look better, but does not provide a clear explanation of why this is the case.

Overall, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some effective examples to support their argument. However, the writing could benefit from more complexity, nuance, and specific evidence to strengthen the argument.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the given statement, that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The writer effectively uses specific examples from various product categories, such as laundry detergents, shampoo, and cigarettes, to support their claim. These examples are well-chosen and relevant to the topic, demonstrating the writer's understanding of the issue.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. At times, the writer's arguments seem to rely on general statements rather than concrete evidence. For instance, the writer claims that ""no detergent can hold the statement"" that they don't bleach clothes after 30 wash cycles, but this assertion is not supported by specific data or examples. Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored the motivations behind advertisers' exaggerations and the impact of these tactics on consumers. What drives advertisers to make such claims? How do these tactics affect consumer behavior and purchasing decisions? Answering these questions could have added depth and complexity to the essay.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively uses rhetorical devices, such as repetition and allusion, to make their argument more engaging. The writing is clear and easy to follow, making it accessible to a general audience.

The essay provides a thought-provoking discussion on the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."" The writer raises a valid point that success is not solely measured by external factors such as recognition, fame, or wealth, but rather by the individual's personal goals and motivations. The writer effectively uses the example of a soccer player to illustrate that success in one area does not necessarily translate to overall success. Additionally, the writer's critique of Walmart and other retail chains as examples of successful people is well-reasoned and highlights the importance of diversification in achieving true success.

For instance, the writer states that ""having cars is one of the popular habits among men,"" but fails to provide any specific data or statistics to support this claim. Similarly, the writer's assertion that Toyota's car production is essential for Japan's economy is based on a single example and lacks broader context.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is marred by grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (e.g., ""Nowerdays,"" ""streetsm,"" ""aor,"" ""hearlth,"" ""ther would""), punctuation errors (e.g., missing articles, incorrect use of commas), and inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., ""Many people have started working to work aor schools"" should be ""Many people have started working to go to school""). These errors detract from the writer's overall argument and make it difficult to take their points seriously.

In conclusion, while the writer demonstrates some understanding of the topic and provides a clear and well-structured argument, their essay is ultimately weakened by grammatical errors, lack of concrete evidence, and a failure to address the environmental concerns raised in the prompt.

The essay provides a clear and relatable example to support the writer's stance on the statement ""Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are."" The writer's personal experience with the mobile phone incident effectively illustrates the point that advertisements often create unrealistic expectations. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing their personal experience to making a broader argument about the impact of advertisements on consumers. Additionally, the writing could be more precise and concise, with more nuanced vocabulary and sentence-level editing.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as allusions (e.g., ""cheap publicity"") and metaphors (e.g., ""hood-winking""), adds flavor to the writing, but sometimes detracts from the overall clarity. Furthermore, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions, to strengthen their argument.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively conveys their opinion. With further refinement, the essay could be even more effective in persuading the reader to share the writer's perspective.

The essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, making the essay engaging and easy to follow. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear topic sentences. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples and anecdotes to support their argument. For instance, the writer's observation that older people may complain about their health conditions as a way to seek attention is a valid point. Additionally, the writer's suggestion that young people may be more likely to be ""sick"" in their minds due to the pressures of growing up is a thought-provoking idea.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. The writer often uses simplistic sentence structures and lacks varied vocabulary, which makes the writing seem less polished. For example, the sentence ""I think that the real situation is different"" is a repetitive and awkwardly phrased sentence that could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. While the writer raises some interesting points, they often rely on general statements and clichés rather than providing concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that ""the world seems under your feet"" when you're young, but fails to elaborate on what this means or how it relates to the topic.

Overall, while the essay shows promise, it requires significant improvement in terms of writing quality, organization, and analysis.

The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples to support their argument.

For example, the sentence ""we should know what is advertisement"" should be ""we should know what an advertisement is."" Additionally, the writer often uses simplistic sentence structures and relies on vague phrases such as ""that is a main reason"" and ""thereby.""

The essay provides a clear and straightforward argument in favor of the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. However, the writer's reasoning is often vague and lacks concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer states that young people enjoy life because they are ""free to go everywhere"" and have ""many new opportunities,"" but fails to provide specific examples to illustrate these points. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases such as ""in the same time"" and ""finally"" disrupts the flow of the essay and makes it difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the writer's argument relies heavily on general statements about the characteristics of young and old people, without considering individual differences and exceptions. For example, some older people may be more adventurous and enjoy activities such as traveling or extreme sports, while others may be content with a more sedentary lifestyle. Similarly, some young people may be more focused on their studies or career goals, and may not have as much time or energy to enjoy social activities.

Despite these limitations, the writer does provide some interesting insights into the experiences and perspectives of young and old people. For instance, the writer notes that older people can enjoy life in different ways, such as through family and leisure activities, and that they can find happiness in their own unique ways. However, these points are not fully developed or supported with evidence.

The essay provides a clear and straightforward argument in favor of the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer attempts to support their claim with specific examples and reasons, although the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""I will explore a few of the most important ones here"" and ""in short,"" is a good start, but it is not consistently applied throughout the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples to support their argument. The comparison between the writer's father and brother is a good example of how young people have more freedom and opportunities to enjoy life. However, the writer could have delved deeper into these examples and provided more analysis of the implications of these differences.

The writer also raises a valid point about the diversity of people and how it affects their enjoyment of life. The sentence ""it seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional others very strict and small problems don't usually get to them"" is a good example of this. However, the writer could have explored this idea further and provided more evidence to support their claim.

Despite these strengths, the essay is marred by several weaknesses. The writing is often simplistic and lacks nuance. For example, the writer states that ""young people have more advantages"" without explaining what these advantages are or how they contribute to a more enjoyable life. The writer also uses several grammatical errors, such as ""when my father want to do something new"" and ""some pfrefer to stay at home when they get older."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Overall, the essay provides a good starting point for exploring the topic, but it requires more development and refinement to make a stronger argument.

The student also raises valid points about the importance of a guide's knowledge, the value of diverse perspectives in a group, and the potential drawbacks of hiring an inexperienced or biased guide.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as more detailed and specific examples to support the student's claims. At times, the writing appears to be simplistic, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""A guided tour is always a preferd tour"" and ""For example if you are travell alone then things will be not be of  greatet interest."" Additionally, the student could have explored more complex and counterarguments to strengthen their position.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar and syntax, such as using transitional phrases to connect ideas and varying sentence structure to improve clarity and flow.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. The student uses various examples from different subjects, including history, geography, and science, to support their claim. They effectively illustrate how understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a deeper comprehension of the subject matter, even if the facts are not always accurate.

However, the student's writing is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of clarity, and a tendency to use simplistic language. The student often uses abbreviations, misspells words, and fails to provide concrete evidence to support their arguments. For instance, the student writes ""i feel the student understad ideas and concepts then facts"" instead of ""I feel that students understand ideas and concepts more than facts."" Additionally, the student's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not always well-supported. While they provide some good examples, they also rely on simplistic and inaccurate statements, such as the claim that the Earth is flat.

The writer presents a well-structured argument that explores the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The essay begins by highlighting the importance of community involvement and the recognition of one's gifts and skills. The writer then delves into the reasons behind this phenomenon, citing the high value placed on time and the hedonistic direction of Western societies. The essay provides specific examples and supporting points, such as the detachment between young people and older generations or people in need, and the prioritization of personal enjoyment over community service.

However, the writer's argument is not without its weaknesses. At times, the essay relies on general statements and vague phrases, such as ""our society and culture"" and ""dominant culture of self-absorption."" These statements lack concrete evidence and could be applied to various contexts. Additionally, the writer's tone can be somewhat critical and judgmental, particularly when discussing the younger generation. A more balanced approach would have been beneficial in presenting the issue.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points.

The essay raises an interesting point about the lack of time young people give to helping their communities, but it fails to provide a clear and well-supported argument.

The essay lacks a clear thesis statement and transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow.

The writer presents a well-structured argument against the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The essay is divided into three main paragraphs, each supporting the writer's claim with personal experiences and logical reasoning. The writer effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples from their own life to illustrate their points. For instance, the writer shares their experience of being a shy child and how it affected their ability to socialize and have fun with friends. This personal anecdote helps to make the argument more relatable and engaging.

However, the writer could benefit from providing more concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention ""peer pressure"" and the importance of overcoming obstacles, these points are not fully developed and could be explored further. Additionally, the writer's use of phrases such as ""what makes a young person happy may not make an older person happy"" is a bit vague and could be clarified.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks variety. The use of repetitive sentence structures and simple vocabulary can make the essay feel a bit flat at times. For example, the sentence ""As we grow up we learn to overcome obstacles and as we get older we get wiser and learn from our own experiences and other's experiences"" is repeated verbatim in two different paragraphs.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the given prompt. The writer attempts to present both sides of the statement and offers some valid points to support their conclusion. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence in its analysis, and the writer often relies on simplistic and clichéd expressions. The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, which hinders the overall flow of the essay.

Moreover, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence and examples to substantiate their claims, instead relying on general statements and assumptions. For instance, the writer claims that older people enjoy having a family and giving birth to an offspring as the most enjoyable thing in the world, but this is an oversimplification and not a well-supported argument. The writer also fails to engage with counterarguments and acknowledges the complexity of the issue.

Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. The writer's final statement that ""Enjoying life is universal, and has no age"" is a good starting point, but it is not fully developed and does not effectively address the original statement.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates some understanding of the topic, it requires significant improvement in terms of analysis, evidence, and coherence.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic, and they attempt to support their stance with relevant examples and reasoning. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence in its development of ideas. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of nuanced vocabulary. For instance, the sentence ""To know as good about history as about biology or astronomy is fantastic"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases such as ""In fact"" and ""In conclusion"" is not always effective in connecting their ideas.

Moreover, the student's argument is not fully developed, and they seem to contradict themselves at times. For example, they initially argue that having a broad knowledge is beneficial, but later state that someone with a broad knowledge is ""specialized in nothing."" This inconsistency undermines the student's overall argument.

Additionally, the student could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively. For instance, instead of saying ""It is hard or even imposs to find a job,"" they could say ""It is challenging to secure employment"" or ""It is difficult to find a job.""

Overall, while the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic, their writing needs significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and vocabulary.

The writer effectively uses specific examples and reasons to support their argument, showcasing their understanding of the topic. However, the essay lacks depth and coherence in its structure, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a failure to address potential counterarguments.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide concrete examples of how young people's energetic and social nature contributes to their enjoyment of life. The mention of university life, recreational activities, and social organizations is particularly noteworthy. However, the writer could have delved deeper into these points, providing more nuanced analysis and supporting evidence.

The writer also struggles with sentence-level grammar and vocabulary, with frequent use of simplistic sentence structures and colloquial expressions (e.g., ""they spare good amount of time""). While these may be common in spoken language, they detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer fails to acknowledge potential counterarguments, such as the idea that older people may have more life experience and wisdom, or that they may have more time to pursue their interests. This omission weakens the writer's argument and makes it less convincing.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and personal perspective on the topic, demonstrating a good understanding of the prompt. However, the writing quality is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and insufficient use of supporting evidence.

One of the major strengths of the essay is the student's ability to express their personal opinion and provide relevant examples. For instance, the student's experience of living in Ecuador and the difficulties they face in their daily life is a compelling reason to support their argument. Additionally, the student's desire to major in physics and the potential consequences of not having a broad knowledge of various subjects are well-expressed.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writing is often simplistic and lacks coherence, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear organization.

For instance, the statement ""knowledge does not make a damage to brain"" is overly simplistic and could be rephrased for more clarity. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. Furthermore, the student often uses grammatical errors, such as ""I went courses"" instead of ""I took courses"" and ""I have no cahnce"" instead of ""I have no chance"". 

The student also struggles with transitions between paragraphs, and the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the advantages of broad knowledge to discussing Einstein's life. Overall, while the student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, their writing could benefit from more refinement and attention to detail.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument that the writer strongly agrees with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer provides specific examples from their personal experience in a hostel setting to support their claim, demonstrating a good understanding of the issue.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and describe the problems faced by the community, such as the issue of standing water bodies and the education of poor workers' children. The writer also highlights the lack of concern shown by young people towards these issues, which is a crucial aspect of the argument.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issues. The writer's arguments are largely based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence, which may not be representative of the broader situation. Additionally, the writer could have explored more theoretical perspectives or evidence-based research to support their claims.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is clear and concise, but it could be improved in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. There are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""I fully agree with this statement. Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities"" (should be ""I fully agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities""), and ""ocals"" (should be ""people"").

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The student effectively uses various reasons to support their claim, including environmental concerns, the development of alternative transportation modes, and safety issues.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples and evidence to support their arguments. For instance, the mention of the Maldives' potential disappearance due to global warming is a striking example of the severity of the environmental consequences of not addressing the issue of car pollution. Additionally, the comparison between driving in Paris and taking the bus is a practical and relatable example of the benefits of alternative transportation modes.

However, there are areas where the essay could be improved. The student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. For example, the sentence ""These are obviously cars and their CO2"" should be rephrased to ""These are obviously cars and their CO2 emissions."" Furthermore, some sentences are worded unclearly, such as ""Why don't we take the bus instead?"" which could be rephrased to ""Why not take the bus instead?""

Another area for improvement is the student's use of vocabulary. While the student attempts to use more complex words, such as ""impressivo"" and ""ecological,"" they often use them incorrectly or in contexts where they don't quite fit.

However, the essay lacks a clear and focused structure, and the writing style is often informal and simplistic. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence and examples to substantiate their claims, relying on general statements and clichés.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement.

A clear thesis statement would have helped to guide the reader through the essay and provide a sense of direction.

The writer's essay provides a clear stance on the statement ""Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities."" The writer argues that young people have shifted their focus from community service to individual leisure activities, such as playing video games and watching television. The writer also highlights the importance of community service and the need for young people to take responsibility for their surroundings. However, the essay lacks a clear and convincing structure, and the writer often relies on vague statements and generalizations.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples, such as the example of community service in schools, which demonstrates the importance of involving young people in community service from an early age. The writer also raises an important point about the need to protect the environment and the impact of individual actions on the community.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer often uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which makes the writing seem immature and lacks clarity. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying on general statements and assumptions. For instance, the writer states that ""many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities"" without providing any specific data or statistics to back up this claim.

Furthermore, the writer's tone is often negative and critical, which may come across as confrontational and unconstructive. The writer also fails to offer any solutions or alternatives to the problem, instead focusing solely on the negative aspects of young people's behavior.

Overall, while the writer raises some important points about the importance of community service and the need for young people to take responsibility for their surroundings, the essay lacks a clear and convincing structure, and the writing could benefit from more attention to detail and evidence-based arguments.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. The writer acknowledges the potential truth of the statement that young people do not help their communities enough, but also presents a balanced view by highlighting the efforts of many young people who actively contribute to their communities. The writer uses relevant examples to support their claim, such as volunteering and participating in international aid organizations. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as some sentences are quite simple and lack variety in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure. Additionally, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their argument, such as statistics or specific examples of successful community projects.

The writer's writing style is clear and easy to follow, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the writer uses the phrase ""specially"" instead of ""particularly"" and ""inmigrants"" instead of ""immigrants."" Furthermore, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""because ot today's society"" which should be ""because of today's society.""

The essay provides a personal perspective on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer presents several reasons to support their disagreement, including the difficulties faced by young people in finding happiness and the prevalence of problems such as war, economic instability, and the pressure to get married. However, the essay lacks a clear and cohesive structure, and the writer's arguments are often fragmented and difficult to follow. Additionally, the writer's writing style is characterized by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of vocabulary variety, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer's personal anecdotes, such as their father's experiences during the Second World War, add a touch of authenticity to the essay, but they are not effectively integrated into the main argument. The writer's conclusion, which suggests that they may be the first person to not enjoy their life, is also unclear and does not provide a satisfying conclusion to the essay.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, acknowledging that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer offers several reasons to support their argument, including the cutthroat competition in various fields, the pressure to meet parental and societal expectations, and the demands of modern life. However, the essay also touches upon the negative aspect of the youth's attitude towards their community, attributing it to globalization and the pursuit of materialistic pleasures.

One of the strengths of the essay is its attempt to provide a balanced view, acknowledging both the challenges faced by young people and the importance of community service. The writer also uses relevant examples, such as the competitive nature of the job market and the academic curriculum, to support their argument.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. At times, the writer's arguments feel somewhat superficial, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. They acknowledge the importance of both facts and concepts, but ultimately argue that understanding concepts is more crucial. The student provides relevant examples, such as the development of new cars and buildings, to support their claim. However, their writing could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language, as well as more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs.

One area for improvement is the student's use of vocabulary and sentence structure. They often rely on simple sentences and colloquial expressions, which can make the text feel somewhat informal and lacking in polish. Additionally, some sentences are worded unclearly, such as ""usually a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain and its there to see or to check"" (emphasis added). A more precise and concise rephrasing would improve the overall clarity of the text.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more effective use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and paragraphs.

The student offers two main reasons to support their claim: firstly, advertisements are based on surveys that analyze the target audience's desires, and secondly, they use tactics such as attractive packaging and models to make products appear more appealing. The student provides specific examples from Kraft's dinner products to illustrate their points, demonstrating a good understanding of the advertising industry.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The student's arguments are largely based on general assumptions and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the student states that advertisements are based on ""scientific data,"" but does not provide any specific examples or references to back up this claim. Additionally, the student's conclusion is somewhat vague and does not effectively summarize the main points of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""A possible explaination"" (should be ""A possible explanation""), ""ther"" (should be ""there""), and ""easilly"" (should be ""easily""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and suggest that the student may need additional support with grammar and sentence structure.

Overall, while the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, their essay requires significant improvement in terms of depth, evidence, and writing quality.

The writer mentions their personal experience with a fashion magazine and notes that their friends have had similar experiences. The writer also provides additional examples of how celebrities and famous people are used in advertisements to make products seem more appealing. However, the essay lacks depth and analysis, and the writer relies heavily on general statements and vague phrases such as ""it is common"" and ""it is the way of showing good."" The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions. Furthermore, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures.

The writer's argument is not well-organized, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing their personal experience to providing examples of celebrity endorsements without a clear connection between the two ideas. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments to their claim, which would have strengthened their argument.

The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the effects of education to the influence of daily events, and the connections between these factors and community involvement are not explicitly explained.

The writer also relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete examples to substantiate their claims. For instance, the writer mentions that well-educated people are more caring of their community, but fails to provide a specific example to illustrate this point. Similarly, the writer's assertion that young people are pessimistic due to daily events such as war in the Middle East is made without providing concrete evidence or analysis.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks clarity. The sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, making the text difficult to follow at times.

The writer's essay provides a clear and relatable perspective on the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument, making the essay engaging and easy to follow. However, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish, which may detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more nuanced vocabulary to enhance the essay's clarity and sophistication.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the subjective nature of enjoyment and the diversity of individual preferences.

However, the writer could have further developed this idea by providing more concrete examples to illustrate the point.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is often simplistic and lacks precision. For instance, the phrase ""I believe people looked up to me"" could be rephrased as ""I felt a sense of admiration from others"" to convey the same idea in a more sophisticated way. Similarly, the writer's use of colloquial expressions, such as ""pysched"" and ""snazzy,"" may not be suitable for an academic essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The student effectively uses specific examples to support their claim, such as the ability to engage in conversations about sports and the discovery of new interests through learning various subjects. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying on simplistic and general statements. For instance, the student's argument that having broad knowledge is better because it is easy to change jobs is not supported by concrete evidence and oversimplifies the complexities of the job market. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the student's ideas more effectively.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be improved in terms of organization and coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to the ease of changing jobs, without a clear logical connection between the two ideas. The student also uses some grammatical errors, such as ""increse"" instead of ""increase"" and ""thouth"" instead of ""though"". These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The student effectively uses transitional phrases and cohesive devices to connect their ideas and make their essay flow smoothly. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

One of the major issues with the essay is the use of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and inconsistent verb tenses. For instance, ""i opine in consense with the statement given"" should be ""I agree with the statement given,"" and ""misshappening"" should be ""mis happening."" Additionally, the student often uses informal language and colloquial expressions, such as ""i"" instead of ""I"" and ""it is better to be guided in a place which is new to us"" instead of ""it is better to be guided in a place that is new to us.""

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. While they provide some good points about the benefits of having a tour guide, they do not fully develop these ideas or provide concrete examples to support their claims. For example, they mention that a guide provides valuable information about the places visited, but they do not explain what kind of information this is or how it is useful.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and organization. Many of their sentences are simple and lack variety, making the essay feel flat and unengaging. For instance, the first paragraph is a simple statement followed by a list of reasons, which does not flow well together.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and provides some good points about the benefits of having a tour guide. With further practice and attention to grammar, sentence structure, and analysis, this student has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

The writer presents a well-structured argument that explores the issue of young people's involvement in community service. The essay begins by setting up a clear thesis statement, which is supported by various reasons and examples throughout the essay. The writer effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, making the text flow smoothly. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and specific examples to support the writer's claims. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The writer's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (e.g., ""Young people are energetic and driven, so they have a responsibility to use their talents meaningfully"") and allusions (e.g., ""the mass media and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves""), adds depth to the essay. However, the writer could have explored these devices more extensively to further enhance the overall impact of the essay.

One area for improvement is the writer's tendency to generalize and make sweeping statements about young people. While the writer provides some specific examples, they often rely on broad statements that may not be universally applicable. For instance, the claim that ""most educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their communities"" may not be true for all educated young people.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of specializing in one specific subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The writer effectively uses specific examples to support their claims, such as the examples of economists who can develop theories on consumer behavior and the job opportunities available to those with a Ph.D. in Computer Science. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying on general statements and simplistic examples. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the argument.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of clear and specific reasons to support the writer's claims. While the writer mentions three reasons, they are not fully developed or supported with concrete evidence. For instance, the writer states that being a specialist can lead to professional development and better job opportunities, but does not provide any concrete examples or data to back up this claim. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, making the essay feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks sophistication, with phrases such as ""I agree with this preferences"" and ""you can be an expert in the matter."" These phrases are not only grammatically incorrect but also lack the nuance and complexity required for a persuasive essay.

In conclusion, while the writer provides a clear and concise argument, the essay is ultimately lacking in depth, analysis, and writing quality. With further development and refinement, the writer has the potential to produce a more effective and persuasive essay.

The writer presents a well-structured argument that explores the potential decline in the number of cars on the road in the next twenty years. The essay begins by highlighting the problems associated with urbanization and the strain it puts on transportation infrastructure. The writer then presents two main reasons to support their claim: the development of public transportation systems and the increasing fuel prices.

The writer effectively uses specific examples from countries like India to illustrate the success of public transportation systems, such as the Delhi Metro and Rapid Bus Transit Systems. These examples demonstrate how public transport can be a cost-effective and efficient alternative to car ownership. The writer also highlights the growing popularity of public transport among citizens, even among the affluent.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of a decline in car ownership. The writer's argument is largely based on the assumption that people will simply switch to public transport, but it does not consider the potential impact on employment, social dynamics, and economic growth.

Additionally, the writer's tone can be seen as somewhat alarmist, with phrases like ""it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation systems"" and ""the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road!"" While these statements are meant to emphasize the writer's point, they come across as somewhat sensationalized.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the given prompt. The writer acknowledges the importance of cars in everyday life and recognizes the potential limitations of petroleum as a fuel source. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to substantiate the writer's claims. The writer relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete examples to support their arguments. For instance, the writer mentions that ""some of these cars are being tested all over the world"" but fails to provide specific details about these cars or their features. Additionally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks cohesion. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of cars to the potential solution of using alternative energy sources. The writer also uses some grammatical errors, such as ""i"" instead of ""I"" and ""mean of transport"" instead of ""mode of transport."" These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay follows a clear chronological structure, starting with an introduction, followed by body paragraphs, and ending with a conclusion. However, the writer could have provided more transitional phrases to connect the ideas between paragraphs and make the essay flow better.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, it requires significant improvement in terms of supporting evidence, writing style, and organization.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of traveling in a group led by a tour guide. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and reasons to support their claim, making their argument more convincing. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved, such as sentence structure, vocabulary, and coherence.

The writer effectively uses personal reasons and examples to support their claim, such as the benefits of learning about places, expressing ideas and thoughts, and overcoming challenges that may arise during the journey. The student also provides relevant examples from various contexts, including industrial tours and office settings, to demonstrate the value of group travel.

The student's essay provides a clear and enthusiastic argument in favor of the statement ""In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."" The student effectively uses various reasons to support their claim, including the convenience and speed of air travel, the lack of traffic jams, and the increasing number of plane accidents. However, the essay also raises some concerns about the safety of air travel, citing the 9/11 attacks as a reason for people's fear. The student attempts to address this concern by pointing out that plane accidents are relatively rare and that airports are becoming more secure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's creativity and imagination in envisioning a future where cars are largely replaced by planes. The idea of having one's own plane, airport, and taxi planes is an exciting and engaging concept. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of such a shift. For example, the student mentions the development of pilots' schools and the variety of plane models, but does not consider the potential environmental impact of increased air travel or the economic implications of a shift away from car ownership.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more precise and technical vocabulary. The student uses many colloquial expressions and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall clarity and credibility of the argument. For example, the sentence ""in spite of the large number of cars, the planes numbers in growing"" should be rephrased as ""despite the large number of cars, air travel is increasing.""

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and a clear enthusiasm for the idea of a future where cars are replaced by planes. However, it could benefit from more attention to detail, technical vocabulary, and nuanced analysis.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer offers several reasons to support this claim, including the financial resources available to advertising companies, the use of visual aids in TV advertisements, and the tendency of advertisements to exaggerate product qualities. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying on general statements and examples that do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and does not provide evidence to support their claims beyond personal opinions. Furthermore, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""attrative"" instead of ""attractive,"" ""influencable"" instead of ""influential,"" and ""adverstiment"" instead of ""advertisement.""

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument against the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The student effectively uses personal experiences and examples to support their claim, such as their parents' reliance on cars for transportation and the lack of alternative options in smaller cities. The student also raises valid points about the convenience and importance of cars in the job market and the oil industry.

However, the essay could benefit from several areas of improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall credibility of the essay. For instance, the student uses incorrect verb tenses, misspells words such as ""varity"", ""indispensible"", ""neccessary"", ""prospected"", ""individual"", ""transportion"", ""citys"", ""z"", ""whz"", ""manz"", and ""convenienct"". These errors undermine the student's ability to express their ideas clearly and effectively.

Furthermore, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and detailed evidence to support their claims. While they raise some valid points about the convenience and importance of cars, they do not adequately address potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For example, they could discuss the environmental impact of increased car usage or the potential for alternative modes of transportation, such as electric or hybrid vehicles.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions and connections between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of cars to the environmental impact, without a clear logical link between the two ideas.

Overall, while the student provides a clear and well-structured argument, their writing is marred by numerous errors and could benefit from more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and organization.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on both sides of the statement. They effectively use specific examples to support their points, such as the benefits of sharing opinions with groupmates, the guide's role in planning the itinerary, and the interactive nature of the tour. However, the student also raises valid concerns about the limitations of group travel, including the potential for poor service, lack of flexibility, and the influence of commercial partnerships. The student's suggestions for choosing a suitable tour company and being flexible within the group are also practical and well-reasoned.

One area for improvement is the student's writing style. At times, the text feels a bit disjointed, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs and a lack of cohesive linking words. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""In my eyes, being in a group means that you no longer master your time."" A more polished writing style would enhance the overall coherence and flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated vocabulary. For instance, instead of using the phrase ""very annoying,"" they could use more descriptive language, such as ""extremely frustrating"" or ""irksome."" This would add depth and variety to their writing.

The writer presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students. The writer provides several reasons to support their claim, including the importance of self-confidence, the ability to think critically, and the potential for personal growth. However, the writer's writing is marred by several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of clarity, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to express their opinion in a clear and concise manner. The writer also provides some relevant examples, such as the statistic from the education issue, which adds some credibility to their argument. However, the writer's writing is often vague and lacks specificity, making it difficult to fully understand their points. For instance, the writer states that ""emotional facts are subjective"" without explaining what they mean by this phrase.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is often informal and lacks precision. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""above the mentioned"" instead of ""as mentioned"" and ""it makes me a person who have own ideas"" instead of ""it makes me a person who has my own ideas."" These errors detract from the writer's overall argument and make it difficult to take their points seriously.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

The writer provides some relevant examples, such as the Japanese culture of ""ikigai"" (finding purpose and fulfillment through online connections), to support their argument.

However, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of a more liberal education to the idea that young people are spending too much time looking at themselves. The transition between these ideas is not smooth, and the writer could have provided more connections between the two concepts. Additionally, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks precision, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.

Furthermore, the writer's argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete evidence and examples to support their claims.

The student attempts to address the statement by presenting two possible paths for students who want to pursue graduate studies after completing their bachelor's degree. However, the essay fails to provide specific reasons and examples to support their claims. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""acadimic"" instead of ""academic,"" ""there way's"" instead of ""two ways,"" ""prsue"" instead of ""pursue,"" ""saing"" instead of ""saying,"" ""bakeground"" instead of ""background,"" ""buesniss"" instead of ""business,"" and ""knowldge"" instead of ""knowledge."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks a clear thesis statement, and their argument is not well-organized. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of broad knowledge to providing examples of students who change their major and pursue graduate studies in a different field.

The writer's essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence. The writer relies heavily on personal anecdotes and general statements, which do not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate their claims.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of clear and specific examples that directly address the statement. The writer mentions various reasons, such as health, knowledge, and transportation, but fails to provide concrete evidence to support these claims. For instance, the writer states that younger people have better health, but the example provided is a personal experience that does not necessarily generalize to all young people. Similarly, the writer's claim that older people have limited knowledge of entertaining places is based on a single anecdote about a friend's grandparents, which is not representative of all older people.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks cohesion. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. The writer also uses grammatical errors, such as ""Eventually, olders can't go out broadly, because they don't know many place to go"" (should be ""Eventually, older people can't go out broadly, because they don't know many places to go"").

In addition, the writer's conclusion is not well-supported by the rest of the essay. The writer states that ""youngs can enjoy life better than olders,"" but fails to provide any evidence to back up this claim. The writer also makes a vague statement about older people enjoying a ""quieter and relaxing life,"" which is not supported by any evidence.

The anecdote about the school trip with the local guide is particularly effective in illustrating the potential drawbacks of traveling with a guide. However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as the ideas seem to jump abruptly from one topic to another.

Additionally, the student could improve their vocabulary and sentence structure to make their writing more engaging and polished. For instance, phrases such as ""I believe will have a lot more independency"" and ""we get to see places the guide wants us to see"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

Furthermore, the student could delve deeper into the benefits of traveling alone, exploring more nuanced aspects such as increased flexibility, personal growth, and the ability to make spontaneous decisions. This would add more depth to their argument and make it more convincing.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some effective examples to support the student's opinion. However, with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the essay could be even stronger.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument against the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer identifies three key reasons to support their claim, including the fact that advertisements are primarily driven by profit, people have varying expectations, and advertising techniques can manipulate emotions. The writer provides specific examples to illustrate these points, such as the emphasis on making people want something rather than providing an honest representation of the product.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis. At times, the writer's arguments feel somewhat general and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions that advertisements are ""prepared by marketing departments to sell them more and more to make profits,"" but does not provide specific examples of how this affects the consumer. Additionally, the writer's writing style is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the the"" instead of ""the,"" ""beacasue"" instead of ""because,"" and ""whic"" instead of ""which."" These errors detract from the overall credibility of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored the topic more deeply by considering multiple perspectives and addressing potential counterarguments. For example, some might argue that advertisements can also provide valuable information about products and help consumers make informed decisions. The writer could have also provided more concrete evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions.

The writer's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic of whether young people enjoy life more than older people do. The writer presents both sides of the argument, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of being young and old. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, which hinders the overall coherence of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, the writer mentions the example of a young couple who wants to travel but lacks the financial means, and the example of an older person who has a strong support system but may have health problems. These examples help to illustrate the writer's points and make the essay more engaging.

However, the writer's writing style is often unclear and lacks precision. For example, the writer uses phrases such as ""The issue of wether young people enjoy life more than other people meet agrate debate"" and ""The youg are under tension and pressure of life and not had the enough experance to take over problems"". These phrases are difficult to understand and detract from the overall clarity of the essay.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic, with the writer presenting their opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer identifies several reasons for this, including the influence of modern technologies, the emphasis on academic education, and the lack of community activities. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence, with many sentences feeling like general statements rather than well-reasoned arguments. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer attempts to provide some specific examples of community activities that could attract young people, such as concerts, sports, and plays. However, these suggestions are not fully developed and lack concrete evidence to support their effectiveness. The writer also fails to address potential counterarguments and provides little analysis of the potential consequences of young people not participating in community activities.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks nuance, with phrases such as ""lots of different distraction"" and ""very excited and very decided"" feeling like they were copied from a dictionary. The writer also struggles with spelling and grammar, with errors such as ""televitions"" and ""enviroment"" appearing throughout the essay.

Overall, while the writer demonstrates a clear opinion on the topic, the essay lacks the depth, analysis, and writing quality expected of a high-level essay.

The essay provides a clear and concise argument in favor of the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. The writer effectively uses specific examples and anecdotes to support their claims, such as the story about jumping off a roof with an umbrella as a demonstration of youthful curiosity and recklessness. However, the essay also suffers from several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of cohesion, and a failure to provide concrete evidence to support the writer's claims.

One of the major concerns is the writer's reliance on clichéd phrases and simplistic sentence structures, such as ""In my opinion,"" ""First of all,"" and ""Last but not least."" These phrases detract from the overall coherence and sophistication of the essay. Additionally, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, instead relying on general statements and assumptions. For example, the writer states that ""younger people are always open to new ideas or cultures,"" but fails to provide any specific examples or data to support this claim.

Furthermore, the writer's argument is not entirely convincing, as it relies on a simplistic and binary opposition between young and old people. The writer fails to acknowledge the complexities and nuances of human experience, and instead reduces the lives of older people to a set of rigid moral values and responsibilities. This oversimplification undermines the writer's credibility and makes their argument less persuasive.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear structure and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the tendency of young people to explore new things to discussing the importance of moral values, without providing any clear connection between the two ideas.

Overall, while the essay demonstrates some potential, it requires significant revision to address its grammatical, organizational, and argumentative issues.

The writer's argument is partially supported by examples from their everyday life, but it lacks a clear and convincing structure, and the writing style is often informal and simplistic. The writer seems to conflate ""trying new things"" with ""taking risks,"" which may not be the same thing. While it is true that people like inventors and discoverers often take risks, this does not necessarily mean that trying new things is a requirement for success. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claim that trying new things is necessary for success. Instead, they rely on a anecdote about a shop owner who is successful without taking risks. The writer's tone is also somewhat contradictory, as they argue that people should be recognized for doing good work without trying new things, yet they also suggest that trying new things is necessary for success.

The writer's writing skills, such as grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, are also not up to the expected level for a second language learner. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence constructions.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. The writer effectively uses specific examples from advertisements to support their claim that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer also acknowledges the limitations of advertisements and the importance of critical thinking on the part of the consumer. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the examples provided. At times, the writer's tone comes across as somewhat confrontational and dismissive of opposing viewpoints, which may detract from the overall persuasiveness of the argument. Additionally, the writer could have explored more theoretical perspectives on the role of advertising in shaping consumer perceptions.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive language is generally effective in connecting ideas and paragraphs. However, there are instances where the writing could be more precise and concise. For example, the writer could have avoided using the phrase ""I think one thing must be realized"" and instead opted for a more direct statement. Furthermore, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence to support their claims about the effectiveness of advertisements in generating sales.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides a clear argument, but could benefit from more attention to detail, nuance, and rhetorical sophistication.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic, with two concrete examples to support their claim. The student attempts to address the prompt by discussing the relationship between taking risks and achieving success, and how this relates to the level of risk tolerance. However, the essay suffers from several issues, including grammatical errors, lack of clarity in some sentences, and a failure to fully develop the ideas presented.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's use of concrete examples to illustrate their points. The two examples provided are well-chosen and help to support the student's argument. However, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the examples, rather than simply presenting them as anecdotal evidence.

The student also attempts to address the prompt's question of whether the level of risk tolerance is related to the level of education or university status. However, this point is not fully developed and could have been explored in more depth. Additionally, the student's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not fully summarize the main points made in the essay.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. There are several instances of grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement errors, incorrect use of articles, and awkward sentence constructions.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument against the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."" The writer presents several points to support their claim, including the financial constraints faced by younger people, the desire for new experiences, and the importance of family. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence for some of these points. For instance, the writer mentions that older people have more time and money, but fails to provide specific examples of how they utilize this time and money. Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks polish, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (""whithout"", ""what a lot of younger people do""). This detracts from the overall credibility of the argument. The writer also fails to engage with the opposing viewpoint, which is a crucial aspect of a well-structured essay.

Despite these limitations, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and presents a coherent argument. With further refinement and attention to grammar and sentence structure, this essay has the potential to be more effective.

The student also raises valid points about the drawbacks of cars, including traffic problems and pollution, and suggests that these issues may lead to a decrease in car usage in the future. However, the student's argument is not entirely convincing, as they fail to provide concrete evidence to support their claim that the number of cars will not decrease in the next 20 years.

One area for improvement is that the student's writing is often unclear and lacks coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the history of vehicles to making a point about the drawbacks of cars, and the student fails to provide a clear thesis statement that ties the entire essay together. Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary and grammar is not always accurate, with errors such as ""car has became"" instead of ""cars have become"" and ""vechicles"" instead of ""vehicles"".

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but their writing skills need significant improvement.

The student's essay provides a clear stance on the statement, arguing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The student offers specific examples from the history of Apple's iPod, highlighting the technical errors and design flaws in the first-generation model, such as the faulty batteries and headphones. These examples effectively support the student's claim, demonstrating that advertisements can create unrealistic expectations and lead to customers paying for products that may not live up to their promises.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and supporting evidence. The student's argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence from a single company's product, which may not be representative of the broader phenomenon. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more detailed explanations of the psychological and marketing techniques used by companies to create these false expectations. Furthermore, the student's conclusion feels somewhat simplistic, stating that customers are to blame for not researching products enough. A more balanced approach would acknowledge the role of companies in creating these false expectations and the responsibility of consumers in making informed purchasing decisions.

The student's essay provides a clear and concise argument in support of the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The student identifies three key reasons for this phenomenon, which are relevant to the topic. 

The student's first reason, that advertisement agencies over-publicize a product, is a valid point. The student explains that this is particularly true during the launch of a new product, where companies can make unsubstantiated claims without evidence. However, the student could have provided more specific examples to support this claim.

The second reason, that advertisements create fantasies in consumers, is also a valid point. The student's explanation of how consumers become disillusioned with the product after the initial excitement wears off is a common phenomenon. However, the student could have provided more concrete examples to illustrate this point.

The third reason, that famous personalities in advertisements can lead to blind trust in brands, is a relevant point. The student provides a good example of how celebrity endorsements can influence consumer behavior.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, instead relying on personal opinions and assumptions. Furthermore, the essay could benefit from a more organized structure and clearer transitions between paragraphs.

The writer's use of language is generally good, with some instances of idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms that add to the essay's informal tone. However, there are also several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. The writer could benefit from more attention to detail in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence-level writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to provide a personal anecdote that illustrates their point. However, this anecdote is not fully developed and could be used more effectively to support the writer's argument. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more critical thinking and analysis of the topic, rather than simply presenting a personal opinion as fact.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."" The student effectively uses two main reasons to support their claim, which are the potential difficulties that may arise when traveling alone and the importance of understanding the history and culture of a place.

The essay provides a clear stance on the statement, agreeing that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. The writer offers two main reasons to support their argument, although they could have elaborated further on these points. The first reason, that advertisements attract people's desire and encourage them to buy, is a valid point. However, the writer could have provided more concrete examples to strengthen this argument. The second reason, that advertisements often present a biased view of products, is also a common criticism of advertisements. The writer's personal experience with a cell phone purchase is a good example of how advertisements can be misleading. Nevertheless, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and supporting evidence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples from their own experiences, such as the class where their teacher helped them relate theory to practice. This example effectively illustrates the importance of practical application in learning. However, the student could have taken this opportunity to analyze the effectiveness of this teaching method more critically, exploring its implications for student learning.

The essay also raises some valid points about the importance of relating concepts to real-life situations and the need for students to be able to apply what they have learned. However, the student's argument is not entirely convincing, as they fail to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. For instance, they state that learning facts is easier to remember when related to reality, but they do not provide any concrete evidence to back up this assertion.

Furthermore, the essay suffers from grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (e.g., ""easier"" instead of ""easier""), incorrect verb tenses (e.g., ""I remind it was""), and awkward sentence structures (e.g., ""When we learn facts it also helps us to convey it with our own experiences""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to take the student's argument seriously.

In conclusion, while the student provides some valid points, their essay is ultimately marred by grammatical errors, lack of depth, and a simplistic argument. With further practice and attention to detail, the student has the potential to produce a more effective and convincing essay.

The student provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The essay is well-organized, and the student effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, the writing lacks clarity and precision in some places. For instance, the student uses vague terms such as ""the price of oil would get higher"" and ""the government cares about the environment and needs money."" These phrases could be more specific and concrete to strengthen the argument. Additionally, the student relies heavily on general statements and lacks concrete examples to support their claims. For example, the student mentions that ""many people research for new ways of transport people that are not as bad for the environment as cars are,"" but fails to provide specific examples of these alternatives. Furthermore, the student's use of first-person pronouns (""I think so,"" ""my friend of me"") detracts from the essay's objectivity and credibility.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is limited, with frequent errors in verb tense, sentence structure, and word choice. For example, the sentence ""They, Would-be Baby-boom generation, were good at various entertainment"" is unclear and awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal and lacks academic tone, which is not suitable for an essay.

Despite these limitations, the writer does provide some interesting insights into the differences between young and older people's attitudes towards life. For instance, the writer notes that young people are more likely to engage in social activities and try new things, which is a positive aspect of being young.

Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, vocabulary, and writing style, but it does demonstrate some potential for growth and development.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement. The student uses relevant examples from various fields, such as business, economics, and art, to support their claim. The student also acknowledges the importance of failure in the learning process, which demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.

However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The student relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as the ""economic principle that'more risk involves more gain'"" and the idea that ""failure is necessary for success."" While these points are true, they are not fully developed or supported with concrete evidence. The student also fails to address potential counterarguments to their position, which would have strengthened their argument.

Additionally, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""peolple"" instead of ""people,"" ""farmaceuticals"" instead of ""pharmaceuticals,"" and ""its"" instead of ""it's."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of sentence structure and vocabulary is limited, with many sentences being simple and lacking variety. This makes the essay feel flat and unengaging to read.

The essay provides a clear and coherent argument in favor of the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the life of Thomas Edison to support their claim, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of perseverance and innovation. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic. The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentence structures is generally clear, but there are instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall clarity of the writing.

One area for improvement is the writer's tendency to rely on simplistic or clichéd expressions, such as ""thousand individuals might hold thousand opinions"" and ""beyond any doubt."" Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""In addition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing's come out can increase the possibility of others related new products' inventions."" The writer could benefit from more precise and concise language to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more explicit connections between the writer's ideas and the prompt.

However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence from credible sources to substantiate their claims. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use relatable examples, such as the example of the unsuccessful student, to illustrate their points. However, these examples are often simplistic and lack concrete details, which makes it difficult to fully understand the writer's intended meaning. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is limited, which disrupts the flow of the essay.

This makes the essay feel like a list of points rather than a cohesive argument. The writer also struggles with nuanced language, using phrases such as ""beauties confort miney"" which is unclear and ungrammatical.

In terms of supporting evidence, the writer relies heavily on anecdotal evidence from their own life and observations of professors and scholars, which is not sufficient to make a strong argument.

However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear paragraph structure. The writer also struggles with grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the writer's failure to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

The student's essay presents a clear and well-structured argument in response to the prompt. They effectively use examples from various contexts, such as education and business, to support their claim that understanding facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. The student's writing is generally clear and easy to follow, although there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide concrete examples that illustrate the importance of learning facts.

Similarly, the example of a businessman needing to learn facts about marketing and experience to succeed in the market is a strong illustration of the importance of factual knowledge in real-world applications.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the relationship between ideas, concepts, and facts. At times, the student's arguments seem to rely on simplistic dichotomies between ideas and facts, rather than exploring the complexities of how these concepts intersect and inform one another.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects over specializing in one specific subject. The student effectively uses specific examples to support their claim, such as the example of a student with a BA degree in business and AAS degree in finance being more attractive to potential employers than one with a PhD in finance alone. The student also highlights the benefits of having broad knowledge, including increased job opportunities, higher earning potential, and the ability to make friends with common interests.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated arguments. The student's writing is often simplistic and lacks depth, with some sentences feeling like they are copied from the prompt. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases and connections between paragraphs to improve the flow of ideas.

Furthermore, the student could have explored more counterarguments to strengthen their position. For instance, they could have acknowledged the potential drawbacks of having broad knowledge, such as the difficulty in mastering a particular subject in-depth, or the potential for information overload. By addressing these potential counterarguments, the student could have made their argument more convincing and persuasive.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides some effective arguments in favor of having broad knowledge. However, it requires more refinement and development to reach its full potential.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument on the topic, and they attempt to support their stance with relevant examples and reasoning. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the essay to a higher level.

One of the major issues is the lack of clear and concise thesis statement. The essay starts with a general definition of success, which is not directly related to the prompt. The student then jumps to their perspective on the economic aspect of success, which is not clearly stated until the second paragraph. A stronger thesis statement would have helped to guide the reader through the essay and provide a clearer direction.

The student also struggles with sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary. Many sentences are worded awkwardly, and there are several instances of grammatical errors, such as ""wether"" instead of ""whether"" and ""buisness"" instead of ""business"". Additionally, the student relies heavily on simplistic vocabulary, which can make the writing seem less engaging and less polished.

Furthermore, the student's argument is not as strong as it could be. While they provide some relevant examples, such as the case of franchising, they do not fully develop their points and often seem to contradict themselves. For instance, they argue that new products can be more successful, but also state that established products can be successful too. A more nuanced and well-supported argument would have made the essay more convincing.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is often simplistic and lacks variety. The essay is heavy on repetition, with the writer using similar sentence structures and vocabulary throughout. The writer also struggles with transitions between paragraphs, which makes the essay feel disjointed and hard to follow.

Despite these limitations, the writer shows some promise in their ability to recognize the value of both young and old people's experiences. The writer acknowledges that older people have the opportunity to enjoy their life in different ways, such as through technology and social connections. However, the writer fails to fully develop this idea and instead relies on general statements about the benefits of aging.

Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in terms of evidence, analysis, and writing style. With further practice and attention to detail, the writer has the potential to produce a more effective and persuasive essay.

The essay provides a clear and well-structured argument against the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and examples to support their claim, making it relatable and engaging. However, the essay lacks concrete evidence and supporting details to strengthen the argument. The writer relies heavily on general statements and vague phrases, such as ""our new style of life,"" ""our personal goals,"" and ""our community is rich."" These phrases do not provide specific examples or data to substantiate the claims. Additionally, the writer's tone is somewhat ambiguous, veering between blaming the individual for their selfishness and encouraging them to change. The writer also uses some grammatical errors, such as ""there may be many reasons why this change came upon us, however, I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life"" (should be ""there may be many reasons why this change came upon us, however, I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life"").

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear call to action. The writer states that young people are not to blame for their selfishness but are unaware, and then suggests that they should try to change. However, the writer does not provide a clear plan or suggestion for how this change can be achieved.

Overall, while the essay provides a clear argument and some good points, it lacks concrete evidence, clear structure, and a strong conclusion.

The writer's essay provides a clear and relatable argument in favor of taking risks and trying new things. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and examples to support their claim, making the essay more engaging and convincing. For instance, the writer mentions the college admission example, which highlights the importance of originality and taking chances in the application process. Additionally, the writer's personal experience as a brain cancer survivor serves as a powerful example of the benefits of taking risks and persevering through challenges.

However, the writer's essay could benefit from more nuanced and sophisticated language. At times, the writing is simplistic and lacks variety in sentence structure and vocabulary. For example, the writer uses repetitive phrases such as ""taking a risk"" and ""being successful"" without fully developing these ideas. Furthermore, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""If you already know how to do a expirement you should try to improve it by taking a risk and actually doing something much defferent."" The writer could also benefit from more precise and technical vocabulary to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

Moreover, the writer's argument could be strengthened by addressing potential counterarguments and considering alternative perspectives. For instance, the writer could acknowledge that taking risks can also lead to failure and that not everyone may be comfortable with uncertainty. By addressing these potential counterarguments, the writer could demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the topic and strengthen their argument.

Overall, while the writer provides a clear and relatable argument, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated language, varied sentence structure, and a more nuanced exploration of the topic.

The student's essay provides a clear and well-structured argument in favor of the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes, real-life examples, and logical reasoning to support their claim. One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance the idea that taking risks can be scary with the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone. The writer also provides concrete examples, such as the example of a recently graduated student who must decide whether to stay home or take a risk by moving to another country. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the statement. At times, the writer relies on general statements without providing specific evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the writing could be more precise and varied in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices is generally effective in connecting ideas and paragraphs, but there are instances where the connections between sentences could be smoother. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more precise and technical vocabulary to enhance the overall clarity and sophistication of the writing.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides a clear and well-supported argument. However, it could benefit from more attention to detail, varied sentence structure, and more precise vocabulary to elevate the writing to the next level.
