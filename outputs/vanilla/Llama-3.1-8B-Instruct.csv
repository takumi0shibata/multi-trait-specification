The essay is a personal narrative that effectively conveys the writer's experience of forming a connection with a classmate through laughter. The writer's use of vivid imagery and descriptive language helps the reader visualize the scene and feel the emotions expressed. The writer's voice is distinct and relatable, making it easy to understand their perspective.

Strengths:

1.  The writer uses sensory details to describe the scene, such as the sounds of the classroom, the feeling of being an outsider, and the sensation of laughter. This helps the reader immerse themselves in the story.
2.  The writer explores the theme of connection and belonging, which is a universal experience that many readers can relate to.
3.  The writer's use of metaphors, such as comparing themselves to a ""flock of seagulls haircut"" and their emotions to a ""balloon stuck inside,"" adds depth and creativity to the narrative.
4.  The writer effectively conveys the emotional intensity of the moment when they connect with their classmate through laughter, using phrases like ""huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes"" and ""my heart felt whole even for that second.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer's use of slang and informal language, such as ""@CAPS1,"" may make it difficult for some readers to understand the context.
2.  The writer jumps between different ideas and emotions without clear transitions, making the narrative feel disjointed at times.
3.  Some sentences are wordy or contain awkward phrasing, such as ""I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5.""
4.  The writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and lengths to create a more dynamic rhythm.

The student's response attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and clarity. The student identifies the theme of determination, which is a relevant aspect of the story, but fails to provide concrete evidence from the narrative to support this claim. The student also introduces an unrelated idea about the hibiscus being a ""winter hibiscus,"" which is not supported by the text. Furthermore, the student's writing is brief and lacks proper sentence structure, making it difficult to understand their reasoning.

The student could have strengthened their response by analyzing the character of Saeng and her decision to take the test again in the spring. For instance, they could have discussed how Saeng's determination is evident in her vow to herself, as seen in the line ""Saeng vowed silently to herself."" This line suggests that Saeng is resolute and committed to her goal, which is a key aspect of determination. Additionally, the student could have explored how the natural imagery in the story, such as the melting snow and the return of the geese, serves as a metaphor for Saeng's personal growth and renewal.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the story. The essay provides some specific examples to support the conclusion, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

One of the strengths of the essay is that it starts by stating the main idea that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. However, the transition to the first example is abrupt, and the sentence ""Although it took him forty miles to get the first town, he didn’t seem to mind"" is unclear. It would be better to explain why the cyclist didn't seem to mind the distance. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"" is a good example of how the setting initially affects the cyclist positively, but it would be more effective if it were integrated more smoothly into the essay.

The essay also provides some good examples of how the setting affects the cyclist negatively, such as the heat and lack of water supply. However, the sentence ""The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. It would be better to rephrase it to something like ""The cyclist got to the point where he was so desperate that he started sucking on pebbles to try to moisten his dry mouth.""

The essay also lacks coherence in some places. For example, the sentence ""In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on"" seems to come out of nowhere and doesn't clearly connect to the previous sentence. It would be better to explain how the sign gave him hope and what kind of strength it gave him.

Finally, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, instead of using the phrase ""his emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful,"" the student could use more descriptive language to convey the same idea.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks specificity and depth in analyzing the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student's answer is quite general and does not provide concrete evidence from the memoir to support their claim. They mention that the author's mood is ""happy, nice, and caring"" but fail to provide any specific examples or quotes from the memoir to back up this assertion.

The student's writing also lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to understand their train of thought. The sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, which makes the essay seem more like a list of adjectives rather than a thoughtful analysis.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on basic words like ""nice"" and ""happy"" to describe the mood. This lack of vocabulary and sentence variety makes the essay seem less engaging and less polished.

To improve, the student should focus on providing specific examples and quotes from the memoir to support their analysis, and work on varying their sentence structure and vocabulary to create a more engaging and polished essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence in its writing. The student has provided some relevant information, but it is not well-organized and lacks supporting details.

The student correctly identifies that the builders had to make changes to accommodate the dirigibles, such as strengthening the building's foundation to handle the stress and pressure from the blimp's load and wind. This shows that the student has grasped the main idea of the prompt. However, the sentence structure and grammar are often simplistic and lack variety, making the essay difficult to follow.

The student also mentions that the blimp would be held by a single cable, which is a crucial point, but it is not fully explained or connected to the rest of the essay. Additionally, the mention of ""$60,000"" for the new framework is a good attempt to provide specific information, but it is not clear how this relates to the overall challenge of docking dirigibles.

To improve, the student should focus on organizing their ideas more clearly, providing more supporting details, and varying sentence structure to make the essay more engaging and easier to understand.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. They have provided two reasons for the author concluding the story with the given paragraph, but these reasons are not well-supported by the text and seem to be based on misinterpretations. The student's analysis is also marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which detract from the overall quality of the response.

For instance, the student states that Saeng picked up a ""Winter Hibiscus"" in the paragraph, but the text actually mentions a ""hibiscus"" without specifying the season. This suggests that the student has not carefully read the text or has misinterpreted its meaning. Additionally, the student's statement that Saeng wants to try her driving test again ""so she can also drive when she gets down passing it"" is unclear and does not accurately reflect the text.

Furthermore, the student's response does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the author's purpose in concluding the story with the given paragraph. The paragraph suggests that Saeng is determined to try again when the circumstances are more favorable (i.e., when the snow melts and the geese return), but the student does not explore this idea in their response.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The student has attempted to share a personal experience related to patience, which is a commendable start. However, the writing lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar.

One of the significant issues is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The essay jumps abruptly from describing a trip to Cedar Point to sharing a specific experience with patience. It would be beneficial for the student to explicitly connect the experience to the concept of patience.

The writing also suffers from grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""I went to sleep but when I wake up we was at burger king"" should be rewritten as ""I fell asleep, but when I woke up, we were at Burger King."" Additionally, the use of abbreviations like ""tom"" instead of ""turn"" and ""mouing"" instead of ""moving"" detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

The student demonstrates some understanding of the concept of patience, as seen in the statement ""I kept moving forward."" However, the connection between this action and patience is not explicitly made. The student could have elaborated on how they remained patient despite the long wait or the fear of the roller coaster.

The use of descriptive language is limited, and the essay could benefit from more vivid and engaging descriptions to help the reader visualize the experience. For example, instead of saying ""it was really nice,"" the student could describe the scenery or the atmosphere of the water parks and hotels.

To improve, the student should focus on revising the essay to address the mentioned issues, ensuring a clear and coherent narrative that effectively connects the experience to the concept of patience.

The student has demonstrated a clear opinion on the effects of computers on people, which is that they improve life and have numerous benefits. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student has provided several examples to support their argument, such as accessing information, learning, communication, entertainment, and educational programs.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing is informal, with several grammatical errors, misspellings, and lack of proper punctuation. For instance, ""enef"" should be ""enough,"" ""effet"" should be ""effect,"" and ""souce"" should be ""source."" Additionally, the student uses informal language, such as ""I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer,"" which detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and balanced perspectives. While they acknowledge that exercise and nature are important, they dismiss these concerns by suggesting that one can still engage in these activities while using computers. A more thoughtful approach would be to address these concerns directly and provide evidence to support their argument.

The student's use of examples is also somewhat superficial. For instance, they mention that one can watch full episodes of shows and movies, but they do not explain why this is a benefit or how it improves life. Similarly, they mention that one can download games, but they do not discuss the potential drawbacks of excessive gaming.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the ideas between paragraphs. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to mentioning the potential drawbacks of exercise and nature.

The essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its writing. The student has attempted to identify the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks specific details from the excerpt.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The writer seems to understand the concept of how setting affects the theme, but the explanation is vague and lacks specific examples. The sentence structure is also simplistic, and the use of vocabulary is limited. For instance, the phrase ""make sence"" instead of ""make sense"" is a grammatical error that detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's idea that a sad story with an ugly rainy day is a good example of how setting affects the theme is a good starting point, but it is not developed further. The writer fails to provide any other examples or elaborate on how the setting influences the story's meaning. The sentence ""That's how the setting makes it better"" is a conclusion, but it is not supported by any evidence from the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and describe the obstacles faced by the builders. The student mentions three main challenges: building a suitable landing area, safety concerns due to the flammability of hydrogen, and the impact of violent air currents. The student also provides specific information from the excerpt to support each of these points, which shows a good understanding of the material.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps directly into describing the obstacles without providing a clear introduction or thesis statement. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the student could provide more analysis and explanation of the information from the excerpt.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more precise language and sentence structure. Some of the sentences are wordy and could be broken up for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated"" could be broken up into two separate sentences for better clarity.

Lastly, the student could benefit from more nuanced analysis of the information from the excerpt. While the student provides specific information, they do not always explain the significance or implications of this information. For example, the student mentions that the back of the ship would swivel around and the lead weights would be dangerous for pedestrians, but they do not explain why this is a significant concern.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but it could be improved in several areas. The writer starts by expressing their dislike for weddings, which is not directly related to the prompt. However, they do provide a personal anecdote about attending a wedding and learning to be patient during a frustrating car ride. The writer effectively uses dialogue to convey the conversation between the characters, and the use of descriptive language, such as ""major traffic jam"" and ""dramatic event just shot out,"" adds to the narrative.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to show, rather than tell, their growth in patience. The use of the phrase ""I was proud"" at the end of the essay suggests that the writer has learned something valuable from the experience. Additionally, the writer's self-awareness about not being the ""patient type"" is a good insight into their character.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several errors throughout the text, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. The writer also struggles with sentence structure, often using short, choppy sentences that make the text difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the writer could have taken more advantage of the prompt to explore the concept of patience in a more in-depth way. While the anecdote is engaging, it feels somewhat disconnected from the main idea of patience. The writer could have also provided more analysis or reflection on what they learned from the experience and how it has impacted their understanding of patience.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific examples of the challenges, including the weight of the dirigible, wind pressure, safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen, and the risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Additionally, the student mentions the impact of nature, such as wind blowing the blimp into surrounding buildings, and an existing law restricting low-flying aircraft in urban areas.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have explained how the builders' decision to strengthen the iron frame of the building was a response to the weight of the dirigible, or how the use of hydrogen posed a significant risk to the city. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the excerpt to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. Some sentences are wordy or unclear, and the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the sentence ""Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles"" could be rephrased to make it clearer how the other obstacles led to this outcome.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the topic, arguing that books, music, and other materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The writer's position is rooted in the idea that individuals have the right to choose what they want to read, hear, or see, and that censorship can lead to a slippery slope where everything is removed from public access.

Strengths:

1.  The writer effectively uses a personal anecdote from a visit to the library to illustrate their point, making the argument more relatable and engaging.
2.  The use of rhetorical questions, such as ""get over it,"" adds a touch of informality and conversational tone, which may appeal to the target audience of a newspaper.
3.  The writer attempts to provide a counterexample by sharing an experience at a bait shop, where they encountered an offensive word, but chose not to confront the speaker. This shows an understanding of the complexity of real-life situations.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the writer's argument at times.
2.  The writing is informal, with several grammatical errors, misspellings, and incomplete sentences, which detract from the overall quality of the essay.
3.  The writer relies heavily on personal opinions and anecdotes, but fails to provide concrete evidence or supporting arguments to strengthen their position.
4.  The conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points or reiterate the thesis.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the thesis statement to clearly articulate the writer's position on censorship in libraries.
2.  Edit the essay for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors to improve clarity and coherence.
3.  Provide more concrete evidence and supporting arguments to strengthen the writer's position.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the modifications to the building's framework as a significant obstacle, citing the substantial cost of ""$60,000"" as evidence. This shows that the student can extract relevant information from the text and use it to support their argument.

However, the student's writing is marred by several grammatical errors, such as ""faceded,"" ""problemb,"" and ""piolot."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay, making it difficult to follow at times.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the obstacles is somewhat superficial. While they mention the shifting winds and the potential consequences, they do not fully explore the implications of these challenges. For example, they mention that the winds could cause the dirigible to be blown onto sharp spires, but they do not explain how this would impact the docking process.

Additionally, the student's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They state that the builders ""acomidated for the use with unpractical things, eventualy leading to the downfall of the mooring mast."" This sentence is confusing and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Firstly, the essay lacks clarity and coherence, with sentences that are often fragmented and difficult to follow. For instance, the phrase ""The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet"" is unclear, and it is unclear what ""strraing"" refers to. Additionally, the student's use of transitions between ideas is weak, making it challenging to understand the logical flow of their argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, such as misspelled words (""teasing him"" should be ""affecting the cyclist"") and incorrect verb tenses (""made him relise"" should be ""made him realize""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Despite these challenges, the student has attempted to provide examples from the essay to support their conclusion. For example, they mention the ""rippling streams,"" the ""old faucet,"" and the ""abandoned Welches grape juice factory"" as features of the setting that affect the cyclist.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt by discussing the features of the setting and its impact on the cyclist. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity, organization, and supporting details. The student has identified three key factors contributing to the cyclist's state: the time of year, the location, and the environment. 

The student correctly points out that the cyclist was cycling in June, which is a hot summer month, and that California is warm even in early @DATE1. This demonstrates an understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist. Additionally, the student mentions that the cyclist was traveling through the deserts, which is a harsh environment that would exacerbate the effects of the heat. 

However, the student could have provided more specific examples from the story to support their claims. For instance, they mention that the cyclist found an old well pump with extremely hot water, but they do not explain how this relates to the setting. They also mention that the cyclist drank too much water at the beginning, but they do not explain why this happened or how it relates to the setting. 

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and ideas.

The essay provides a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The writer has identified three main obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock: violent winds, legal restrictions, and the danger of hydrogen. However, the explanation for each point is brief and lacks specific details from the excerpt.

For instance, when discussing the violent winds, the writer quotes a relevant sentence from the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"". However, this quote is not fully utilized to explain the impact of the winds on the dirigibles. The writer could have elaborated on how the shifting winds affected the docking process or the safety of the people on board.

Similarly, when discussing the legal restrictions, the writer mentions that it was ""illegal for ship to tie up to a building,"" but fails to provide any context or explanation of why this was a significant obstacle. The writer could have explored the potential consequences of violating this law or how it affected the builders' plans.

The third point about hydrogen being highly flammable is accurate, but it is not directly supported by the excerpt. The writer could have provided more context or evidence from the excerpt to strengthen this argument.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion about the Mooring Mask becoming an attraction for sightseers seems unrelated to the main topic of obstacles faced by the builders. This sentence could be removed or rephrased to better connect to the rest of the essay.

The writer's use of language is generally good, but there are some errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. For example, ""Imidiately"" should be spelled as ""Immediately,"" and ""unmistakeably"" should be spelled as ""unmistakably.""

The writer also uses some clichéd phrases, such as ""one of the most amazing things"" and ""it'll probably never happen again."" While these phrases are common, they can make the writing feel less original.

Finally, the writer could have provided a more effective conclusion that ties together the anecdote and the main point of the essay. The final sentence, ""If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite,"" feels out of place and could be rephrased for a more effective conclusion.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the height of the Empire State Building (1,250 feet) and the flammability of hydrogen, which is a key reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student could have provided more details about the law against airships flying too low to urban areas, as mentioned in the excerpt. Additionally, the student could have explained how the mooring mast was designed to accommodate dirigibles and what specific features made it suitable for this purpose.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay fails to provide a well-structured explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The student mentions that the cyclist would want to have towns with water and a place to get something to eat and rest, but these points are not supported with specific examples from the essay. In fact, there is no mention of the essay's content in the student's response. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""they’re"" instead of ""their"" and ""gey"" instead of ""get."" Furthermore, the student's use of phrases like ""they would want to have"" and ""they would want"" is repetitive and lacks variety.

The student's response does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the prompt, and the writing lacks depth and analysis.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in writing about patience, but there are areas that need improvement. The essay is well-structured, and the student has attempted to provide a personal experience related to the prompt. However, there are several grammatical errors, and the writing lacks clarity and coherence in some parts.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has tried to connect the concept of patience to their personal experience. They describe a situation where they had to undergo a medical check-up and blood test, and how they managed to remain patient despite feeling anxious. This shows that the student understands the concept of patience and can relate it to a real-life situation.

However, the essay is marred by several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, ""wen"" should be ""when,"" ""she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too"" is a run-on sentence, and ""I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed"" is a confusing sentence. Additionally, the student uses informal language and slang, such as ""wen,"" ""had butterflys,"" and ""sorta hurt like a pinch.""

The student also struggles with coherence and transitions between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the medical check-up to the blood test, and the connection between the two events is not clear. The student also uses vague phrases, such as ""a few days later"" and ""about a year,"" which make it difficult to follow the timeline of events.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on correcting grammatical errors, using proper punctuation and capitalization, and clarifying the transitions between paragraphs. They should also use more formal language and avoid slang.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, but their essay lacks clarity and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas without providing a clear connection between them. The essay also contains several grammatical errors and lacks specific details from the excerpt.

The student correctly identifies two obstacles faced by the builders: flying blimps and a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. However, the explanation of these obstacles is brief and lacks depth. For instance, the student mentions that flying blimps too low in the area made the Empire State building taller than it was supposed to be, but this is not supported by the excerpt. In fact, the excerpt suggests that the builders added a top or a hat to the building to make it taller, not that the blimps caused the building to be taller than intended.

The student also fails to provide specific information from the excerpt to support their claims. For example, they mention that Al Smith announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929, but this information is not relevant to the obstacles faced by the builders. The student should have focused on how this announcement relates to the obstacles, such as how it may have affected the builders' plans or decisions.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The transitions between ideas are abrupt, and the sentences are often short and simplistic. The student should work on providing more detailed and nuanced explanations of the obstacles faced by the builders.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts by stating that the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the connection between the two is not well-established. The student provides an example from the text, ""old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office,"" but fails to explain how this example supports their claim about the features of the setting affecting the cyclist.

The student's writing also shows a lack of understanding of the prompt, as they seem to be discussing the impact of the setting on older people rather than the cyclist. Additionally, the sentence structure and grammar are simplistic, and there are no clear transitions between ideas. The student could benefit from more development and explanation of their ideas.

The student's use of quotes from the text is a good start, but they could have analyzed the quote more deeply to provide a stronger connection to the prompt. For example, they could have discussed how the setting of the old-timers' porches affects the cyclist's experience or perspective.

The sentence ""The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all"" does not directly relate to the prompt and seems to be a non-sequitur. The writer then tries to provide an example from the essay, but it is unclear what essay they are referring to, as the prompt does not mention an essay. The sentence ""in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong"" seems to be a reference to a story or anecdote, but it is not clear how this relates to the prompt.

The writer also uses informal language and slang (""guy"" instead of ""person"" or ""individual""), which is not suitable for a formal essay. Additionally, the writer's use of the phrase ""@MONTH1"" is unclear and seems to be a typo or a formatting error.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by identifying the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and analysis. 

The student has correctly identified the mood of the memoir as ""up-beat"" and provided relevant quotes to support their answer. They have also demonstrated an understanding of the author's emotions, such as gratitude and pride, which are evident in the quotes provided. However, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of how these quotes contribute to the overall mood of the memoir.

One area of improvement is in the use of transitions and connections between ideas.

The student could explain how the hibiscus specifically provides comfort and confidence, such as by serving as a symbol of hope or resilience in the face of adversity.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and grammar. For example, the phrase ""the last 'vowe'"" should be ""the last vow"" (vow, not vowe), and ""canfidence"" should be ""confidence.""

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the writer struggles with spelling and grammar, which makes the text difficult to understand. The use of words like ""pacent"" instead of ""patient"" and ""wating"" instead of ""waiting"" indicates a lack of attention to detail and proofreading.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear and engaging narrative. The writer simply states a situation where they were patient, but fails to provide any context or details that would make the reader invested in the story. The phrase ""That is the story of one of the times I was pacent"" feels like a non-sequitur and does not provide any closure or resolution to the story.

Additionally, the writer could have explored the concept of patience more deeply. For example, they could have described how they felt during the experience, what they learned from it, or how it affected them. The essay remains superficial and does not provide any meaningful insights into the concept of patience.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they fail to provide a clear and specific example of a time when they demonstrated patience. The statement ""Know matter what you are always be patient"" is a vague and clichéd conclusion that does not add any depth to the essay.

The writer also fails to address the prompt's requirement to write about a specific experience or story. Instead, they jump between two unrelated ideas: waiting for a phone and obtaining a snowmobile license. This lack of focus and coherence makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer demonstrates a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist, but the writing lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of descriptive language. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify the features of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the hills, rough terrain, sand, and tumble weeds. The writer also attempts to describe the emotional impact of these features on the cyclist, stating that they make him think he will die and feel dry, vivid, and hopeless. However, the writer could have provided more specific and detailed descriptions to support their claims.

For example, when describing the old, rusty water pump, the writer states that it ""shows that it hasn’t been used in ages."" This sentence could be strengthened by providing more context or details about what this means for the cyclist. Additionally, the writer could have explored the symbolism of the black tar pumped out by the water pump and how it contributes to the cyclist's negative thoughts about life.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. The use of short, simple sentences, such as ""These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him,"" makes the text feel choppy and difficult to follow. The writer could have used more complex sentence structures to create a more cohesive and engaging narrative.

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and its impact on the cyclist.

The student has also provided some examples to support their claims, such as the lack of water and its poor quality in California. However, the analysis could be more thorough and detailed.

For instance, when discussing the hot weather, the student mentions that it made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. While this is a good starting point, the student could have explored more about how the heat affected the cyclist's physical and mental state, such as fatigue, heat exhaustion, or decreased concentration. Similarly, when discussing the terrain, the student mentions that it made the cyclist thirsty and tired. However, the student could have provided more specific examples of how the terrain affected the cyclist, such as steep hills, rocky paths, or uneven surfaces.

Furthermore, the student could have also explored how the cyclist's physical and emotional state was affected by being in the middle of nowhere. For example, the student could have discussed how the isolation made the cyclist feel anxious, scared, or disoriented.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They have identified three main challenges: the need to modify and strengthen the building's frame to accommodate the stress caused by a moored dirigible, the financial cost of these modifications, and safety concerns related to the use of hydrogen in some dirigibles.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The current opening sentence is somewhat vague and does not effectively introduce the main topic.

Additionally, the student could have provided more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support their claims. For example, while they mention that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame,"" they do not provide any specific details about how this stress would be mitigated or what specific modifications would be required.

The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors, which detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building"" is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is not always smooth, leading to some abrupt shifts in tone and focus. For example, the sentence ""I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building"" seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the essay.

Finally, the student's use of rhetorical devices and figurative language is limited, and some sentences, such as ""They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people,"" are awkwardly phrased and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writing is marred by grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of proper sentence structure. The student's arguments are based on personal opinions and general statements, but they fail to provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the influence of movies and books on children to the issue of obesity and laziness. The transitions between paragraphs are weak, and the student fails to connect their ideas effectively.

The student's arguments are also based on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning. For instance, they mention the high number of pregnant teens and the tragic consequences of children killing their parents, but they do not provide any concrete data or statistics to support these claims. The student also relies heavily on sensational language, such as ""cereal killers"" and ""spry,"" which detract from the credibility of their argument.

Furthermore, the student's suggestions for change are vague and lack specificity. They propose removing ""bad influences"" from libraries and encouraging children to go outside and exercise, but they do not provide any concrete plans or strategies for implementing these changes.

Despite these criticisms, the student shows some potential in their writing. They demonstrate a clear passion for the topic and a desire to protect children from harm. With guidance and practice, they may be able to develop more effective writing skills and present a more compelling argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The sentences are often fragmented, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For example, the sentence ""Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the mooring mast and its purpose to make the explanation more comprehensive.

Secondly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are some grammatical errors.

The student could also benefit from using more precise and technical terms related to the topic, such as ""aerostat"" instead of ""dirigible.""

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly related to the main idea of the essay.

The essay effectively tells a personal story about the importance of laughter in a relationship, specifically between the writer and their brother. The writer's narrative is engaging and relatable, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of descriptive language, such as ""heart to heart talk,"" ""extremely hurt,"" and ""laughed until we cried,"" helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the emotional depth of the situation. The writer successfully captures the distress and anxiety felt by their brother, as well as the writer's own feelings of concern and empathy. The use of specific details, such as the setting (the backyard) and the time (middle of @DATE1), adds to the narrative's authenticity.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the story to the prompt. While the writer mentions that laughter was an element in the story, it would be more effective to explicitly state how laughter helped their brother get through the difficult time.

Additionally, some of the sentences could be tightened up for better clarity and concision. For example, the sentence ""I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us"" could be rephrased for easier understanding.

The writer also uses some informal language and colloquial expressions, such as ""tiny, little, lame joke"" and ""just kids."" While these expressions are common in spoken language, they may not be suitable for formal writing. It would be beneficial for the writer to consider using more formal language to enhance the essay's overall tone.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it explicitly tied the story back to the prompt and provided a clearer answer to the question of whether laughter helped the brother get through the difficult time.

However, this is not the primary reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The student also mentions that the flowers were budding up, but this is not a significant detail in the provided paragraph.

A more accurate interpretation would be that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey a sense of hope and renewal. The image of the hibiscus budding in the spring, accompanied by the return of the geese, suggests a new beginning and a chance for the protagonist, Saeng, to try again. This is supported by the fact that Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring, indicating that she sees the season as a time of opportunity and growth.

The student's response could be improved by providing more specific examples from the story to support their claims and by explaining the significance of the author's choice of imagery and symbolism.

One of the strengths of this essay is its ability to connect the setting to the cyclist's experience. For instance, the student mentions that the cyclist ""started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid"" and ""started to get dehydrated and could barely keep his balance."" These examples effectively illustrate how the desert setting affects the cyclist's physical condition. Additionally, the student provides a vivid description of the snake blocking the pavement, which shows how the setting can also pose a physical challenge to the cyclist.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed analysis and explanation of the setting's impact on the cyclist. The student could have explored how the hills, heat, and humidity contribute to the cyclist's dehydration and how the snake's presence affects his ability to navigate the path. Furthermore, there are several grammatical errors, such as ""bairly"" instead of ""barely"" and ""realy"" instead of ""really,"" which detract from the overall clarity of the writing.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in writing about patience, but there are several areas that need improvement. The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, and the writing is often informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation. The student has attempted to use the prompt to tell a story, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks detail.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to use a personal experience to illustrate the concept of patience. The story about the road trip to West Virginia and back is a good starting point, but it could be developed further to make it more engaging and coherent. However, the student's writing is often hindered by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""vary vary patience"" instead of ""very patient,"" and ""sum"" instead of ""some.""

The student also struggles with sentence structure and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""Sleep and then hit the road the next day"" is a fragment and should be rephrased to make it a complete sentence. Additionally, the use of all capital letters for emphasis, such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2,"" is not necessary and can be distracting.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks descriptive language and sensory details, which would help to bring the story to life. For instance, what did the hotel pool look like? What did the presents look like? How did the student feel when they finally arrived at their destination?

To improve this essay, the student should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement, using proper grammar and punctuation, and incorporating more descriptive language and sensory details to make the story more engaging.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The student has identified two main obstacles: the lack of suitable landing area and the structural limitations of the building. 

The student's discussion of the mooring mast idea is somewhat unclear, and the explanation of the structural concerns is oversimplified. The mention of the cost of modifying the steel frame is a good point, but it is not fully developed. The student also makes a judgmental statement about architects not seeing potential problems, which is not supported by the excerpt.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""oppertunity"" instead of ""opportunity"" and ""possibley"" instead of ""possibly."" Additionally, the sentence structure is sometimes awkward, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth.

The essay provides a personal anecdote that effectively illustrates the significance of laughter in forming relationships. The writer's narrative is engaging and relatable, making it easy for the reader to visualize the scene and connect with the emotions expressed. The use of vivid descriptions, such as comparing laughter to a ""chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven"" and the teacher's outfit to ""baby throw up,"" adds a touch of creativity and humor to the essay.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the anecdote to the prompt. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the writer's first day of high school to the drama class, making it slightly disjointed. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity.

The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides specific examples to support their argument. The use of sensory details, such as the feeling of being stared at and the sound of the teacher's voice, helps to create a immersive experience for the reader. The writer also shows a good command of grammar and spelling, with only a few minor errors.

The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and a more nuanced exploration of the theme. The writer relies heavily on the anecdote, but could have delved deeper into the emotional significance of laughter in relationships. The conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has taken a stance on censorship in libraries. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has provided a logical argument in support of their position. However, there are areas that require improvement to elevate the writing quality.

Strengths:

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist in the story. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The student provides some relevant examples from the text to support their conclusion, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and simplistic sentence structures.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify specific settings that affected the cyclist, such as the hot weather and the abandoned juice factory. The student also provides relevant quotes from the text, such as ""I could drop from heat stroke,"" to support their analysis. However, the student fails to fully develop these ideas and provide a more nuanced understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist.

The student's writing is hindered by grammatical errors, such as ""I this setting,"" ""this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this,"" and ""This also made him dis apointed."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's analysis is often simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the student states that the cyclist thought about how thirsty he was when he came to the abandoned juice factory, but fails to explain why this is significant or how it affects the cyclist's experience.

The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of patience, but it lacks depth and clarity in its execution. The writer attempts to provide a personal anecdote about a time when they experienced patience, but the narrative is fragmented and lacks coherence. The use of informal language and grammatical errors detracts from the overall impact of the essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The writer jumps directly into the story without establishing a clear connection to the concept of patience. The narrative is also marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""we was"" instead of ""we were"" and the incorrect use of the possessive form ""my mother's phone"" is not present, but ""my mother"" is used multiple times.

The writer attempts to illustrate the concept of patience by describing a situation where they and their mother waited for their brother to finish basketball practice. However, the description is brief and lacks detail, making it difficult to fully understand the context and significance of the event. The writer's conclusion that ""now that's what I call patience"" feels abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the rest of the essay.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on providing a clear and concise thesis statement, using proper grammar and spelling, and developing a more detailed and coherent narrative. They should also strive to provide more insight into the concept of patience and how it was demonstrated in the story.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's personal experience with patience is shared, but the narrative is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence. The writer's use of language is informal, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the writer's tone, which is often casual and conversational. While this tone may be suitable for a personal anecdote, it is not ideal for a formal essay. The writer's use of colloquial expressions, such as ""Weird huh?"" and ""have a good night!"" detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's writing lacks clarity and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the writer's lack of patience to sharing a story about a safety course. The connection between the two is not explicitly stated, making it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought.

The writer's use of language is also a concern. There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of punctuation. For example, the sentence ""My patience completely were off"" should be ""My patience was completely off."" Additionally, the writer's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with proper nouns and common nouns both being capitalized at random.

Despite these issues, the writer does attempt to address the prompt and shares a personal anecdote about patience. The story is engaging, and the writer's use of descriptive language, such as ""weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache,"" is effective in conveying their emotions.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay provides specific examples from the excerpt to support the writer's claims, which is a strong aspect of the essay. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and sentence structure.

The student has identified three main obstacles: safety, nature, and law. The safety issue is well-explained, citing the use of highly flammable hydrogen in most dirigibles made outside of @LOCATION1. This is a clear and concise explanation. The mention of ""violent air currents"" in relation to nature is also a good point, but it could be more effectively linked to the context of the Empire State Building. The law obstacle is also mentioned, but the explanation is somewhat vague, stating that existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" without providing further context.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the obstacles to stating that they ""hindered the attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."" A more logical flow of ideas would be to conclude the discussion of each obstacle with a sentence summarizing how it affected the builders' attempt.

The writing could also benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language. For example, the sentence ""obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered be attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.

The writer attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in accommodating dirigibles, but the writing could be more effective with better organization and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is its attempt to provide specific details from the excerpt, such as the need for over $1,000 worth of changes to strengthen the building's framework and the design of the rocket-shaped mast made of aluminum. However, the writer could have provided more context and explanation for these details to make the information more meaningful.

The essay also struggles with grammatical accuracy and coherence. For example, the sentence ""Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the buildings framework"" is unclear and contains a typo (""@MONEY1"" should be replaced with the actual amount). Additionally, the sentence ""They had begun to build additinoal floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area"" contains a spelling error (""additinoal"" should be ""additional"").

Furthermore, the writer could have provided a clearer thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the topic, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence to make a compelling argument. The writer's main point is that libraries should have censorship to protect young kids from accessing potentially harmful materials. However, the reasoning behind this stance is somewhat simplistic and relies heavily on general statements.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples to support the claims made. The writer mentions that certain materials can teach kids ""bad things,"" but fails to provide concrete examples of what these ""bad things"" are or how they can be prevented through censorship. Similarly, the argument about bad influence is also vague, with the writer stating that kids might tell their friends to do ""stuff that isn't right,"" but not specifying what this ""stuff"" is or how it can be prevented.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar, with several run-on sentences and missing articles. For instance, the sentence ""That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all"" is unclear and difficult to follow. Additionally, the writer's use of phrases like ""I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life"" is awkward and lacks coherence.

Despite these challenges, the writer does attempt to address the topic and provides a clear thesis statement. However, the essay would benefit from more development and support to make a stronger argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that materials that may be considered offensive should not be removed from the shelves. The essay begins with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the student's argument. However, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's personal experience with censorship, which is used to support their argument. The example of being unable to check out a certain movie due to age restrictions is a relatable and effective way to illustrate the issue. The student also attempts to address potential counterarguments, acknowledging that some people may be offended by certain materials, but ultimately concludes that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read or watch.

The student's writing is often informal, with grammatical errors and missing articles. For instance, ""The @CAPS1 Materials"" should be ""Certain materials"" and ""My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves"" should be ""I believe that materials that show offense in libraries should not be removed from the shelves."" Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""in my eyes"" and ""I been through"" detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing.

The student's use of a quote from an ""ebony magazine"" is an interesting attempt to add depth to the argument, but the quote is not properly cited, and its relevance to the topic is not fully explained. Furthermore, the quote itself is not particularly relevant to the discussion of censorship in libraries.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat simplistic and lacks nuance. While they acknowledge that some people may be offended by certain materials, they do not fully consider the potential impact of these materials on vulnerable individuals or communities.

The writer provides a personal anecdote about a time when they experienced a mix of patience and impatience, which is a good way to illustrate the concept. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more focused thesis statement that explicitly connects the story to the concept of patience.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's use of descriptive language, which helps the reader visualize the scene and feel the emotions of the writer. For example, the writer describes the days leading up to the trip as ""a bore"" and the wait as ""torture,"" which effectively conveys their frustration and impatience. The writer also uses sensory details, such as watching a movie and eating pizza, to show how they passed the time.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more analysis and reflection on the concept of patience. The writer mentions that they were ""uber bummed"" and ""impatient"" at times, but they don't explicitly explain how they managed to be patient in the end. The writer also jumps abruptly from describing their impatience to stating that they were patient, without providing a clear explanation of how they made the transition.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify some benefits of computers, such as learning about other people and places. The writer also mentions the fun aspects of using computers, like playing games and talking to friends online. These points are relevant to the topic and show a good understanding of the subject.

However, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow the train of thought. For instance, the writer starts by mentioning the benefits of learning about other people and places, but then abruptly shifts to talking about playing games and using websites like mySpace and yahoo. This lack of cohesion makes the essay feel disjointed and disorganized.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is informal and lacks proper grammar and spelling. There are several instances of misspelled words, such as ""ting"" instead of ""think,"" ""deid"" instead of ""died,"" and ""alot"" instead of ""a lot."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to take the writer's opinion seriously.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims. While they mention that learning about other places is fun, they do not provide any specific examples or details to back up this statement. This lack of evidence makes the essay feel more like a list of general statements rather than a well-supported argument.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on organizing their ideas more clearly, using proper grammar and spelling, and providing more evidence to support their claims.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their analysis of the mood created by the author in the memoir is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. They have identified a few instances where the author expresses happiness, but they do not provide a thorough examination of the text to support their claim. The student's understanding of the author's emotions and the literary device of mood is limited, and their analysis is primarily based on a surface-level reading of the text.

The student correctly identifies the author's love for his parents and Cuban culture as a source of happiness, but they do not consider other emotions or themes present in the memoir. For example, they do not address the potential sadness or challenges that the author may have faced, which could have added complexity to their analysis. Additionally, the student's use of the phrase ""mostly all of the paragraphs"" is vague and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the text's structure or the author's use of paragraphs to convey mood.

The student's reference to paragraph @NUM1 is accurate, but they do not provide a thorough analysis of the quote or its significance to the overall mood of the memoir. They simply state that the quote shows the author is happy, without explaining why or how the quote contributes to the overall mood.

To improve their analysis, the student should have read the memoir more closely, paying attention to the author's use of language, imagery, and themes to create a specific mood.

However, their analysis could be more nuanced and supported by specific details from the story.

The student correctly notes that the paragraph brings together the ideas presented in the story, but they could have provided more concrete examples to illustrate this point.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist's mood. The essay provides a clear narrative of the cyclist's emotional journey, which is influenced by the environment he encounters. However, the writing could benefit from more detailed and descriptive language to effectively convey the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotions.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to create a sense of progression and change in the cyclist's mood. For example, when the cyclist is in the ""nice, shaded, and cool"" @LOCATION1, he feels ""fairly good"" and is ""excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path."" This shows how the pleasant setting contributes to his positive mood. Conversely, as his water supply depletes, his mood ""sinks lower"" and he becomes more frustrated, illustrating how the lack of resources affects his emotional state.

However, the essay could benefit from more vivid descriptions of the setting to help the reader visualize the environment and its impact on the cyclist. For instance, instead of simply stating that the cyclist finds a ""Welch's Grape Juice, Factory,"" the student could describe the surroundings, such as the smell of grape juice, the sound of machinery, or the sight of grape juice bottles. This would help to create a more immersive experience for the reader and make the setting feel more real.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases or sentences to connect the different ideas and paragraphs. At times, the writing feels a bit disjointed, making it difficult to follow the cyclist's journey.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by identifying the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific examples from the text. The student has provided three quotes from the memoir, but the analysis of these quotes is somewhat superficial. To improve, the student could have explored the language, imagery, and tone used in the quotes to further support their claim about the mood created by the author.

The student has also shown a good understanding of the memoir's content, particularly in discussing the author's love for cooking and his family. However, the student could have provided more context about the memoir's events and how they contribute to the overall mood.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some areas for improvement in terms of grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. For example, the student could have used more complex sentences to connect their ideas and provide a more cohesive argument.

The essay attempts to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" However, it falls short in providing a clear and well-supported analysis. The writer mentions a few instances where the setting impacts the cyclist, but the explanations are brief and lack depth.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific details about the setting. For example, when describing the desert, the writer mentions ""temperatures of @NUM1 degrees,"" but fails to provide the actual temperature value, making it difficult to understand the severity of the situation. Additionally, the writer states that the cyclist's water tasted like battery acid, but does not explain how this affected the cyclist's mental state or physical well-being.

The writer also struggles to connect the setting to the cyclist's emotions and actions. For instance, when the cyclist loses hope, the writer states that he ""thought more negative about things and didn’t think he would make it,"" but does not elaborate on how the setting contributed to this emotional state. Furthermore, the writer abruptly shifts to the idea that the cyclist ""got the agility to move on,"" without explaining how the setting influenced this change in behavior.

To improve the essay, the writer should provide more specific details about the setting and its impact on the cyclist. They should also work on connecting the setting to the cyclist's emotions and actions in a more explicit and logical manner.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but there are areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and organization. The essay starts with a strong statement about the benefits of computers, but the writer jumps between ideas without a clear structure. The writer attempts to present both the positive and negative effects of computers, but the transitions between these ideas are not smooth.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to think critically about the impact of computers on people. The writer acknowledges the potential negative effects, such as bullying and the risk of low self-esteem, and also highlights the positive effects, such as the ability to stay in touch with friends and access information. However, the writer could have explored these ideas more thoroughly and provided more specific examples to support their claims.

The writer's writing style is informal, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""In many ways computers have been very useful to the human rare"" should be ""In many ways, computers have been very useful to humans."" Additionally, the writer uses colloquial expressions, such as ""I know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school,"" which may not be suitable for a formal letter to a newspaper.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and coherence. Some sentences are short and lack connection to the previous sentence, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, ""Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet."" The writer could have used transitional phrases to connect the ideas and make the essay flow better.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis statement and organizing the ideas in a logical manner. The writer should also work on using more formal language and avoiding grammatical errors. Finally, the writer should provide more specific examples to support their claims and use transitional phrases to connect the ideas.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt, but their response could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and supporting evidence. The student mentions that the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the explanation is brief and lacks specific details. The student correctly identifies the setting as a hot place (the deserts of California) and a hot time of year (June), but fails to elaborate on how these features specifically impact the cyclist.

The student provides a relevant quote from the text, ""I was traveling the high desserts of California in June,"" which supports their claim about the setting. However, they do not effectively connect this information to the impact on the cyclist. The student also mentions that the cyclist was getting thirsty quicker and had limited water, but these points are not fully developed.

To improve, the student could provide more specific examples and details about how the hot setting and time of year affected the cyclist's experience. For instance, they could describe how the heat made the cyclist feel, how it affected their physical performance, or how it influenced their decision-making.

The student has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""While computers, are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you"" and ""Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammar.""

The student has also provided some relevant statistics and examples to support their argument, such as the increase in obesity rates and the surgeon's comment about the rise in heart surgeries. Additionally, the student has included quotes from a grandmother and an English teacher to add credibility to their argument.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing is often informal and lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For example, ""exercing"" should be spelled as ""exercising,"" and ""cardovascular"" should be spelled as ""cardiovascular."" The student also uses colloquial expressions, such as ""hottest thing online these days,"" which detract from the formal tone of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and sentences can be improved. Some sentences are wordy and lack clarity, such as ""People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style. They are more likly to go on the computer than go exercise."" A more concise and clear sentence would be ""People who spend hours on the computer are more likely to lead a sedentary lifestyle and prefer computer activities over exercise.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing concerns about the excessive use of computers and its negative effects on individuals. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.

Strengths:

* The student has effectively used transitional phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs, such as ""For example,"" and ""Finally.""
* The essay presents three valid points about the negative effects of excessive computer use: lack of exercise, neglect of nature, and decreased interaction with family and friends.
* The student has used rhetorical questions to engage the reader, such as ""That is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons:""

Weaknesses:

* The essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles.
* The writing lacks variety in sentence structure, with many simple sentences that could be combined or rephrased for better flow.
* The student has not provided concrete evidence or examples to support their claims, relying on general statements and vague assertions.
* The conclusion feels abrupt and lacks a strong final statement.

Suggestions for improvement:

* Review grammar and spelling to ensure accuracy and clarity.
* Vary sentence structure to create a more engaging and dynamic writing style.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar. The essay fails to effectively explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides personal anecdotes and observations to support their position, which is a good practice in persuasive writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue. They recognize that people have different opinions and that just because one person may not like a particular book or material, it doesn't mean that others won't. This shows an understanding of the importance of individual freedom and the diversity of human experiences.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writing could benefit from more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. The student often relies on simple sentences and phrases, which can make the text seem a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries?"" could be rephrased to something like ""The question of whether books, music, movies, or other materials that contain offensive content should be removed from library shelves is a complex and contentious issue.""

Additionally, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments. While they mention that some books can help people learn about the consequences of certain actions, they don't provide specific examples of books or situations that illustrate this point.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and re-emphasized the student's position. As it stands, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and doesn't leave the reader with a lasting impression.

The essay lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which makes it difficult to understand at times. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they struggle to express their thoughts coherently.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a personal example of patience, which is a requirement of the prompt. They describe a situation where they had to wait in line at a location, and they successfully convey that they remained patient despite the inconvenience. The student also mentions that the wait was worth it because the food was good, which shows that they can think critically about the situation.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the student's writing is riddled with grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, ""I whent"" should be ""I went,"" and ""patein"" should be ""patient."" Secondly, the student's sentences are often short and lack variety, which makes the essay feel choppy. Finally, the student could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the situation.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on proofreading their work for errors, varying their sentence structure, and using more descriptive language. With practice and attention to these areas, the student has the potential to produce high-quality writing.

Evaluation:

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against removing materials from shelves if they are found offensive. The writer effectively uses personal experience and observations to support their argument, which is a commendable effort for a middle school student. However, the essay falls short in several areas, hindering its overall effectiveness.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is its concise and straightforward approach to the topic. The writer directly addresses the question and presents their opinion in a clear and easy-to-follow manner. The use of personal anecdotes, such as the influence of parents and older siblings on children's behavior, is a good way to connect the issue of censorship to real-life experiences.

However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to strengthen the writer's argument. The writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""Not all music or movies are offensive,"" without providing specific examples or explanations. This lack of detail makes it difficult for the reader to fully understand the writer's perspective.

Furthermore, the writer's argument is somewhat simplistic and fails to consider multiple viewpoints. The statement ""If parents can change the way they raise their children, I think the world would be a better place"" oversimplifies the complex issue of censorship and parenting. Additionally, the writer's assertion that people who create offensive content ""don't care who watches it or what affects it would have on children"" is an unfair generalization.

In terms of writing mechanics, the essay contains several errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. The writer's use of capitalization is inconsistent, and there are instances of run-on sentences and missing articles. While these errors do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the essay, they detract from the writer's credibility and professionalism.

Firstly, the student has not provided a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The introduction jumps directly into the obstacles without providing a clear context or overview of the topic.

The student has identified two main obstacles: the shifting winds on top of the building and the law against airship flying too low over urban areas.

For instance, the student mentions that the winds are ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" but does not provide any evidence or examples to support this claim. Similarly, the student mentions that the law against airship flying too low over urban areas is a reason why dirigibles cannot moor, but does not provide any context or explanation of this law.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student has provided several convincing arguments to support their position, including the idea that people can choose what they read or listen to, and that what offends one person may not offend another.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of personal experience and observations to support their arguments. For example, they mention that teenagers are interested in action and romantic films and books that contain physical and sexual content, and that removing these items would push teens away from reading and viewing. This shows that the student has thoughtfully considered the potential impact of censorship on different groups of people.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. The writing could be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. Additionally, some of the paragraphs could be more clearly linked to the main argument, and the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

The student also could have benefited from more nuanced and specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, instead of simply stating that a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man but not to a black man, they could have provided a more detailed explanation of how this book could be seen as a valuable resource for understanding history.

Furthermore, the student could have explored the potential consequences of censorship more thoroughly. For example, they could have discussed how censorship could lead to a lack of diversity in the materials available in libraries, or how it could stifle free speech and creativity.

The student has identified three key features of the setting that affect the cyclist: hot weather, isolation, and lack of water. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student relies heavily on general statements and personal opinions rather than providing specific examples from the text to support their claims.

For instance, when discussing the hot weather, the student states, ""hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can’t do anything."" While this is a common understanding of the effects of heat, it would be more effective to provide a specific example from the text that illustrates this point.

The student's interpretation of the character's emotions is also somewhat contradictory, stating that the character is ""disappointed"" but then suggesting that they should be more interested in growing the garden. This inconsistency suggests a lack of understanding of the character's motivations and emotions.

The student could have benefited from a more nuanced analysis of the story, exploring the character's emotional journey and the symbolism of the garden. For example, they could have discussed how the garden represents the character's hopes and dreams, and how the snow serves as a barrier to her achieving those goals.

The writer mentions the ""difficult places"" and the ""along, crippling hill"" that Joe Kurmaskie encountered, which demonstrates the challenging terrain he faced. The writer also mentions the cyclist's decision to suck on a pebble to take his mind off his thirst, which shows the extreme measures he took to cope with the setting.

However, there are areas where the writing could be improved. The writer could benefit from more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the terrain to the weather, stating, ""The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him."" A transitional phrase, such as ""In addition to the challenging terrain,"" could help to connect these ideas more smoothly.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more descriptive language to make the essay more engaging. While the writer mentions the ""high deserts of California,"" they could provide more vivid descriptions to help the reader visualize the setting.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the author's intention behind the conclusion of the story. They have identified the key elements that contribute to Saeng's determination and the role of nature in giving her strength. However, the analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. The student could have explored the symbolism of the geese, hibiscus, and the melting snow in more depth, explaining how these elements specifically relate to Saeng's emotional state and her connection to her past.

The student's use of transition words and phrases, such as ""in conclusion,"" is a good attempt to summarize the main points, but it feels a bit abrupt and could be more smoothly integrated into the paragraph. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the story to support their claims, such as specific quotes or descriptions that illustrate Saeng's emotional state and her connection to nature.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Strengths:

* The student has identified the main obstacles faced by the builders, including the stress on the frame, the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the U.S., and the challenges posed by nature, such as violent air currents.
* The student has provided relevant quotes from the excerpt to support their answer, which shows that they have read and understood the text.
* The student has attempted to explain the reasons behind the challenges faced by the builders, such as safety concerns and the impracticality of the mooring mast.

Weaknesses:

* The student's writing is not clear and concise, with some sentences being wordy and difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""Allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building, would leave architects faced with challenging sinerio's"" could be rephrased for better clarity.
* The student has not fully addressed the prompt, which asks for a description of the obstacles faced by the builders. The essay jumps between different ideas and does not provide a clear and cohesive answer.
* The student has not provided a clear thesis statement or conclusion, which would have helped to tie the essay together and provide a clear summary of the main points.

The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of patience, but it lacks depth and clarity in its writing. The student has attempted to write a story about a time when they experienced patience, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks descriptive language. The use of capitalization for names and titles is inconsistent, which may indicate a lack of attention to detail.

The student has tried to convey the idea that they were patient during a visit to an office, but the story is told in a fragmented manner, making it difficult to follow. The use of phrases such as ""Then she left out she went an found the othere"" suggests a struggle with sentence structure and grammar. Additionally, the student has not provided any context about the situation, making it hard to understand the significance of their patience.

The student has also failed to provide a clear and concise conclusion to the story, instead ending with a abrupt farewell. The quote from the @CAPS1 is a nice touch, but it feels tacked on and does not add much to the overall narrative.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir and has attempted to analyze the author's emotions throughout the text. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and specific. The student has identified a few key sentences that contribute to the mood, but could have explored more examples and provided more detailed explanations.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the author's love and gratitude towards his family and culture. The student has provided specific examples from the text, such as the author's description of his house as ""simple"" and his appreciation for his parents' love and sacrifice. These examples demonstrate the author's positive emotions and contribute to a relaxed and peaceful mood.

However, the student could have delved deeper into the text to explore other emotions and moods present in the memoir. For instance, the student could have analyzed the author's tone when discussing his family and culture, and how it contrasts with other moments in the text. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the text to support their claims, such as quotes or descriptions that illustrate the author's emotions.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. Some sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better understanding.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of laughter in relationships and its role in bringing people together. The writer provides personal anecdotes and examples from their favorite comedians and movies to support their argument. However, the writing quality is hindered by several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherence in some paragraphs.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to express their personal opinions and feelings about laughter and comedy. They provide specific examples from their favorite movies and comedians, such as Adam Sandler and a second unnamed comedian, to illustrate their points. The writer also shows a good understanding of the concept of laughter and its benefits, as seen in the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""

However, the essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of punctuation, and misspelled words. For example, the writer uses ""play's"" instead of ""plays,"" ""persuit"" instead of ""pursuit,"" and ""whotammy"" instead of ""whoa, mama."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand in some places.

Additionally, the writer's paragraphs lack coherence and flow. Some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the paragraph, and the writer jumps abruptly from one topic to another. For example, the transition from discussing Adam Sandler to mentioning a TV show called ""Wild'n Out"" is unclear. The writer also uses informal language and slang, such as ""dont,"" ""quit,"" and ""pritty,"" which may not be suitable for a formal essay.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking. They fail to provide a clear thesis statement or a logical conclusion to the essay.

The writer effectively conveys the main idea that patience is about being understanding and tolerant in the face of difficulties. However, the essay lacks depth and detail, making it seem more like a series of events rather than a cohesive narrative. The writer fails to explicitly state how @PERSON1's patience is demonstrated throughout the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is its simplicity and ease of understanding. The writer uses basic vocabulary and sentence structures, making it accessible to a middle school audience. The story is also easy to follow, and the writer stays on topic throughout.

However, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to engage the reader. For instance, the writer could describe what the video game was, how @PERSON1 felt when he finally got it, or what he did with it after purchasing it. Additionally, the writer could have explored the emotional aspects of @PERSON1's experience, such as how he felt when his dad lost his job or when he finally got the game.

Furthermore, the writer could have taken the opportunity to explain the concept of patience more explicitly.

The student has also effectively used examples from their own experience and observations to illustrate their points.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's writing could also be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.

The student has shown a good understanding of the topic and has effectively used quotes from Katherine Paterson to support their argument. They have also demonstrated an awareness of the potential consequences of censorship, including the stifling of knowledge and innovation.

One area where the student could improve is in providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims. While they mention that some books might be considered racist or suggest radical ideas, they do not provide specific examples of such books. This would make their argument more convincing and engaging.

The student's use of vocabulary is generally good, but there are some instances of awkward phrasing and word choice. For example, the sentence ""Parents try the best they can to repel the content away from their children"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The writer effectively uses descriptive language to convey the cyclist's experiences and emotions, making the reader feel as though they are part of the journey. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved to make it more engaging and polished.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of sensory details to describe the setting. For example, the phrase ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed"" effectively conveys the cyclist's resilience and determination. Additionally, the description of the desert heat making the water taste like ""battery acid"" is a vivid and memorable image that highlights the cyclist's struggles with dehydration.

However, there are some areas where the writing could be improved. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as the ideas seem to jump abruptly from one to another. For instance, the sentence ""He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water"" seems disconnected from the previous paragraph. Furthermore, some of the sentences are quite short and lack variety in structure, which can make the writing feel a bit choppy.

Another area for improvement is in the use of descriptive language. While the writer does a good job of describing the setting, some of the descriptions feel a bit generic. For example, the phrase ""changing terrain"" could be more specific and detailed to help the reader visualize the scene.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

However, the essay lacks a clear introduction and transitions between the different points. The writer jumps abruptly from one feature to another without connecting them to the main idea.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. For instance, the sentence ""Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1"" is unclear and lacks a subject-verb agreement.

The writer attempts to provide examples to support their conclusion, but they are not fully developed. For example, the statement ""he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead"" is a good start, but it could be expanded upon to provide more context and detail.

The essay provides specific examples from the article ""The Mooring Mast"" to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student could have provided more context about the article ""The Mooring Mast"" and its author, Marcia Amidon. The mention of the author's name in all capital letters seems to be a formatting error, and it would be better to provide more information about the article's relevance to the topic.

Secondly, the student could have organized their ideas more effectively. The essay jumps between different points without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow at times. For example, the student starts by mentioning safety concerns, then moves to the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and finally discusses the impact of wind and air currents.

Thirdly, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles mentioned in the article. While they correctly identify the safety concerns and the impact of wind and air currents, they could have gone further in explaining how these obstacles affected the builders' ability to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast.

Lastly, the student could have used more precise language and grammar in their writing.

The essay is written in a simple and easy-to-understand language, which is suitable for a middle school level. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided specific examples to support their opinion, such as learning about new places, exercising fingers, and communicating with others. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to illustrate the benefits of computers. Additionally, the student has used transitional phrases, such as ""Also"" and ""And that concludes,"" to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's opinion is not explicitly stated in the introduction, and the reader is left to infer their stance on the topic. Secondly, the essay could benefit from more detailed and specific examples to support the benefits of computers. For instance, the student mentions that computers help with hand-eye coordination, but they could have provided more information on how this is achieved.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be more polished and refined. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, ""A few examples are you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on google"" should be rephrased to ""A few examples are learning about places you didn't know about by searching on Google."" Additionally, the student could have used more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Lastly, the essay could benefit from a more balanced perspective. While the student presents several benefits of computers, they do not address the potential drawbacks mentioned in the prompt, such as spending too much time on computers and less time exercising or interacting with family and friends.

Score: 8

Reasoning for the score: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and well-structured essay. However, the essay lacks a clear thesis statement, more detailed examples, and a polished writing style. Additionally, the student could have presented a more balanced perspective by addressing the potential drawbacks of computers. Overall, the essay is a good effort, but it requires more refinement and attention to detail to reach a higher score.",8

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of examples from the essay. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors and simplistic vocabulary. The student fails to provide a clear thesis statement or a well-structured argument, making it challenging to follow their train of thought. The use of phrases such as ""affect the cyclist alot"" and ""disprate"" instead of ""desperate"" indicates a need for improvement in grammar and spelling.

The student does attempt to mention specific features of the setting, such as the heat of the sun and the rough terrain, but fails to provide a clear explanation of how these features impact the cyclist. For instance, the student states that the setting makes the cyclist drink his water faster, but does not elaborate on why this is the case or how it affects the cyclist's overall experience.

To improve, the student should focus on providing more detailed and specific examples from the essay to support their argument, as well as work on refining their writing skills to ensure clarity and coherence.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion and its significance. They have identified the connection between the final paragraph and the beginning conflict of the main character, Saeng, failing her driver's test. The student also correctly points out that the author uses the image of the hibiscus blooming in the spring to foreshadow Saeng's decision to retake the test. However, the student's analysis could be more nuanced and detailed.

The student's explanation of the author's purpose in concluding the story in this way is clear, but it could be more specific and supported by textual evidence. For example, the student could have mentioned how the image of the hibiscus is significant because it is a plant that is often associated with warmth and new beginnings, which contrasts with the cold and wintry atmosphere of the story. Additionally, the student could have analyzed how the use of the phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" creates a sense of seasonal change and renewal, which is mirrored in Saeng's decision to retake the test.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. For example, instead of saying ""the author therefore is not leaving the reader confused,"" the student could say ""the author effectively resolves the conflict and provides a sense of closure for the reader.""

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has taken a stance on censorship in libraries. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided some convincing arguments to support their position. However, there are areas where the student could improve to elevate their writing quality.

Strengths:

1. The student has effectively used a quote from Katherine Paterson to introduce the topic and set the tone for their argument.
2. They have provided a clear thesis statement in the first paragraph, stating that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the libraries.
3. The student has used relevant examples, such as the importance of freedom of speech and the value of reading opposing views, to support their argument.
4. They have acknowledged the potential issue of some books not being suitable for certain age groups and suggested a solution, such as placing them in restricted areas.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from a stronger introduction that sets up the topic more effectively. The first paragraph feels a bit abrupt and doesn't fully engage the reader.
2. Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, such as ""Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences."" (should be ""Everyone has a different opinion..."").
3. The student could have provided more concrete examples to support their arguments, such as specific books or movies that have been challenged or banned in the past.
4. The conclusion feels a bit abrupt and doesn't fully summarize the main points made in the essay.

Evaluation: 
The student has attempted to summarize the story and its conclusion, but their analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. They correctly identify the main character's fondness for the winter Hibiscus and her failure in a test, but their interpretation of the story's message is overly simplistic. The student states that the story is saying that ""nothing can be as good as what's at home,"" which is not entirely accurate. The story seems to be more about Saeng's determination and her willingness to try again, rather than a comparison between home and elsewhere.

The student also fails to provide any specific details or examples from the story to support their claims. They do not mention the significance of the geese returning or the hibiscus budding, which are crucial elements in the final paragraph. Furthermore, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (""Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet"").

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more organized structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the hot and dry desert setting to the cyclist's physical and emotional state. A more logical flow of ideas would help the reader follow the writer's train of thought. For instance, the writer mentions the tarlike substance and brackish water, but then suddenly shifts to the terrain change and the picture of the young boy. A transitional phrase or sentence could help connect these ideas more smoothly.

Secondly, the writer could provide more specific and detailed descriptions of the setting and its effects on the cyclist. While the writer mentions the hot and dry desert setting, they could elaborate on how this environment affects the cyclist's physical and emotional state. For example, the writer could describe how the heat and dryness make the cyclist feel, or how the terrain change affects their biking experience.

Thirdly, the writer's use of vocabulary and grammar needs improvement. There are several spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, such as ""ooted out,"" ""brakish,"" and ""envicus."" Additionally, the writer could use more precise and descriptive language to convey their ideas. For instance, instead of saying ""the water was barely even water,"" the writer could say ""the water was barely potable.""

Lastly, the writer's conclusion could be more effective if it summarized the main points and reiterate the thesis statement. The current conclusion is a bit abrupt and doesn't provide a clear summary of the essay's main ideas.

The essay effectively tells a personal story about the importance of laughter in forming relationships. The writer shares a vivid and relatable experience of moving to a new school and making a new friend through shared laughter. The narrative is engaging, and the writer's emotions and thoughts are well-conveyed throughout the essay.

Strengths:

1.  The writer starts with a clear and concise thesis statement, ""Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time."" This statement is supported by a personal anecdote, making the essay more relatable and engaging.
2.  The writer uses descriptive language to paint a picture of their experience, such as ""I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change"" and ""a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me."" This helps the reader visualize the scene and connect with the writer's emotions.
3.  The writer effectively uses transitions to connect their ideas, such as ""And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay"" and ""The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together."" This helps the reader follow the writer's train of thought and understand the significance of the events.
4.  The writer shows growth and self-awareness by reflecting on their past self and how they have changed, ""I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and lengths to create a more dynamic rhythm. Many of the sentences are simple and similar in structure, which can make the essay feel a bit flat.
2.  Some of the sentences could be more concise and to the point. For example, the sentence ""It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on"" could be shortened to ""Saying goodbye to them was difficult, but we visited later on.""
3.  The writer could provide more sensory details to make the story more vivid and engaging. For example, what did the school look like? What did the writer's new friend smell like? What did they eat for lunch?
4.  The writer could explore the theme of laughter and relationships more deeply. While",1

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of mood in a literary text and attempts to analyze the author's intention in creating a specific mood in the memoir. However, there are some areas where the student's analysis could be improved. 

Firstly, the student correctly identifies the mood as ""grateful"" and provides two quotes from the excerpt to support their claim. The quotes are relevant to the analysis, and the student explains how they contribute to the overall mood. However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the quotes, such as exploring the language and tone used by the author to convey the mood.

Secondly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. There are some grammatical errors, such as ""consteintly"" instead of ""constantly,"" and ""truely"" instead of ""truly."" Additionally, the student could have used transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

Lastly, the student could have provided more evidence from the text to support their analysis. While the two quotes provided are relevant, there may be other quotes or passages that could have been used to further support the student's claim.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept that the setting can affect the mood of a character, specifically the cyclist in this case. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence in its writing, which makes it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. The use of grammatical errors, such as ""strat"" instead of ""start,"" ""eidance"" instead of ""evidence,"" and ""over welming"" instead of ""overwhelming,"" detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The student attempts to provide examples from the story to support their conclusion, but these examples are not effectively integrated into the essay. For instance, the quote ""to"" is used incorrectly, and the sentence structure is awkward. The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how the setting affects the cyclist's mood, instead stating that the ""over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels."" This suggests a lack of understanding of the author's purpose and the relationship between the setting and the character's emotions.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and analysis. The essay could benefit from more specific and detailed examples from the story to support the claim that the setting affects the cyclist's mood. Additionally, the student could have explored the ways in which the setting contributes to the cyclist's emotions, such as the contrast between the barren desert and the rest stop.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, arguing that removing books or materials from shelves because they offend someone is not acceptable. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and comparisons to illustrate their point, making the essay engaging and relatable.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by posing a thought-provoking question, drawing the reader into the discussion. This grabs the reader's attention and encourages them to consider the issue from the writer's perspective.
2.  The use of comparisons, such as the example of a white boy not wanting to learn with a black girl in class, effectively highlights the absurdity of removing materials based on personal offense. This comparison is well-chosen and helps to drive home the writer's point.
3.  The student emphasizes the importance of freedom of expression and the right to read or write whatever one chooses. This is a crucial aspect of the argument and is well-supported by the writer's assertion that removing offensive materials would be taking away this freedom.
4.  The conclusion is clear and concise, restating the main argument and reiterating the importance of freedom of expression.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from more organization and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from the introduction to the conclusion, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the argument.
2.  Some of the sentences are grammatically incorrect or contain spelling errors, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""wight"" should be spelled ""write,"" and ""meteral"" should be spelled ""material.""
3.  The writer could have provided more evidence to support their argument, such as examples of books or materials that have been removed from libraries due to censorship and the impact this has had on readers.
4.  The writer could have also explored the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of diverse perspectives and the limitation of access to information.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but there are areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammar. The essay starts with a general statement about computers being interesting pieces of technology, but it lacks a clear thesis statement that outlines the student's opinion on the effects of computers on people.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge opposing viewpoints and provide counterarguments. For instance, the student mentions that some people might think computers are a waste of time, but they effectively argue that computers can be useful for tasks such as writing papers and playing educational games. However, the student could have strengthened their argument by providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""intresting,"" ""compter,"" and ""keyborad."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, the student could have benefited from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to make the writing more engaging.

In terms of content, the student does a good job of highlighting the benefits of computers, such as helping with writing and research. However, they could have explored more nuanced arguments, such as the potential negative effects of excessive computer use on physical and mental health.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the need to modify the building's framework to accommodate the stress of the dirigible, as mentioned in the text. The student has also noted the significant cost of these modifications, which is a crucial aspect of the challenge faced by the builders. However, the student could have provided more specific details about the modifications made to the building's framework.

The student has also correctly identified the issue of strong winds and air currents as an obstacle, but could have provided more context about how this affected the docking of dirigibles. Additionally, the student's statement about the hydrogen being ""highly flammable"" is not supported by the text and could be considered an assumption.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the benefits of computers in society, showcasing the writer's ability to express their opinion effectively. The writer provides specific examples to support their argument, such as learning about different cultures, communicating with friends and family, and using computers for educational purposes. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of organization, coherence, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's use of personal anecdotes to illustrate the positive effects of computers. For instance, the story about emailing and video chatting with a family friend who was in a different location is a compelling example of how computers facilitate communication. Additionally, the writer's mention of using the internet for research and educational purposes is a valid point, as it highlights the computer's utility in academic settings.

However, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the text. The writer jumps abruptly into their argument without providing a clear thesis statement or context. Furthermore, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, as the writer often starts new sentences without connecting them to the previous ideas.

In terms of sentence structure, the writer tends to use simple sentences, which can make the text feel a bit flat at times. Varying sentence length and structure can help create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience. Additionally, some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as ""Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study."" The correct sentence should be ""Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her page to help us study.""

The writer also makes some general statements that could be more specific and supported with evidence. For example, the claim that ""the computer helps us get through life"" is a broad statement that could be more effectively argued with specific examples.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and accuracy.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the obstacles faced by the builders, including the height of the building, the danger of air currents and storms, and the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas. The student also provides specific examples from the excerpt to support their claims, such as the incident involving the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" and the description of the dirigible swiveling around the mooring mast.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive and logical organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the height of the building to the danger of air currents and storms, and then to the pre-existing law. A clearer transition between these ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Additionally, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as ""architects never realized"" (should be ""architects did not realize""), ""use a highly flammable hydrogen"" (should be ""used highly flammable hydrogen""), and ""say if"" (should be ""safe""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more precise language and vocabulary. For example, instead of using the phrase ""many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day,"" the student could use a more specific and descriptive phrase, such as ""many pedestrians would be walking on the streets below.""

Finally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles faced by the builders. While they identify the obstacles, they do not provide much insight into why these obstacles were significant or how they impacted the builders' plans.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it could be improved with more detailed analysis and supporting evidence. The writer effectively identifies the physical and emotional challenges posed by the setting, such as the heat, lack of water, and constant uphill riding. However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and descriptions to illustrate these points.

For instance, when discussing the heat, the writer mentions that it ""can take a lot of energy out of someone,"" but it would be more effective to provide a specific example, such as ""the blistering sun beating down on the rider's skin, making every pedal stroke feel like a chore."" This would help the reader visualize the situation and understand the impact of the heat on the cyclist.

Additionally, the writer mentions that the lack of water and hope can lead to major trouble, but it would be helpful to explain how these factors specifically affect the cyclist's physical and emotional state. For example, the writer could describe how the lack of water leads to dehydration, which can cause fatigue, headaches, and decreased performance.

The writer also uses some vague phrases, such as ""the whole mind over matter thing,"" which could be clarified with more specific examples or explanations. For instance, the writer could describe how the cyclist's mental state is affected by the lack of hope, such as feeling demotivated or discouraged.

2.  They provide three valid reasons for not removing these materials from the shelves, including the vast number of potentially offending books, the importance of individual choice, and the potential loss of great literature.
3.  The writer uses simple, clear language, making their argument accessible to the target audience.
4.  They demonstrate an understanding of the purpose of libraries and the importance of diverse materials.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the writer's main argument at times.
2.  Some sentences are wordy or lack proper punctuation, which can make them hard to understand.
3.  The writer could benefit from more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and paragraphs.
4.  The conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and doesn't effectively summarize the main points.

Score: 4

The essay provides a clear and concise overview of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The writer has identified three main challenges: the impact of high and changing winds, safety concerns for passengers and bystanders, and a law prohibiting low-flying airships over urban areas. However, the essay could benefit from more specific details and evidence from the excerpt to support these claims.

One area of improvement is the lack of direct quotes or specific information from the excerpt to support the writer's points. For instance, the writer mentions that the winds atop the building were ""at high speeds and always changing,"" but it would be more effective to include a direct quote or a specific statistic from the excerpt to illustrate this point. Additionally, the writer could have explored the consequences of these obstacles in more depth, such as how the high winds affected the dirigible's stability or how the law impacted the building's design.

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow more smoothly. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the obstacles to stating that ""the many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building."" A more nuanced explanation of how these obstacles ultimately led to the decision not to allow dirigibles to dock would have strengthened the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a negative impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the claim: computers are bad for eyesight, lead to less social interaction, and contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle. The student has provided some evidence from studies and experts to support their arguments, which is a good attempt to make their claims more convincing.

However, there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. The arguments presented are oversimplified and lack supporting details. For instance, when discussing the impact of computers on eyesight, the student mentions a specific percentage increase in eye problems, but fails to explain the underlying causes or provide more context. Similarly, when discussing the impact on social interaction, the student cites a study that shows a decrease in conversations at social gatherings, but does not provide any further analysis or explanation.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of commas. Additionally, the student's tone is somewhat confrontational, with phrases like ""These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes"" and ""Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today."" While the student is trying to persuade the reader, a more balanced and respectful tone would be more effective.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat repetitive, restating the main points without adding any new insights or summarizing the main arguments. A more effective conclusion would provide a final thought or call to action that leaves the reader with something to think about.

Score: 6

Reasoning for the score:

* Content (2 points): The student has presented three main points to support their claim, but the arguments are oversimplified and lack depth.

* Conventions (2 points): The essay contains several grammatical errors and lacks proper punctuation.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts by stating that the setting adds a sense of ""ergancy,"" which seems to be a typo and likely meant to be ""urgency."" However, the student fails to provide a clear explanation of how the setting contributes to this sense of urgency. 

The student mentions that the cyclist is running out of water in the middle of the desert, which is a valid point. However, the comparison to being in a forest or the suburbs is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist. The student also quotes the cyclist's thoughts, which is a good attempt to provide evidence from the text, but the quote is not properly integrated into the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""he is the middle of the dessert"" (should be ""in the middle of the desert"") and ""exclaims it did n’t really matter"" (should be ""exclaims it didn't really matter""). The student also uses informal language, such as ""he talks about passing out and dieing"" (should be ""he talks about passing out and dying"").

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against the excessive use of computers. The writer effectively uses specific examples and statistics to support their claim that computers have a negative impact on people's health and well-being. The writer also raises valid concerns about the risks associated with the internet, such as the presence of unprofessional websites, hacking, and viruses.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use personal anecdotes to illustrate their point. The example of the writer's sister who spent more time on the computer and gained weight is a compelling and relatable example that helps to drive home the writer's argument. Additionally, the writer's use of quotes from a scientist adds credibility to their argument and provides further evidence to support their claim.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as many of the sentences are simple and lack depth. Additionally, the writer could provide more evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions, to make their argument more convincing.

The writer also struggles with grammar and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the writer uses ""unprofessional websites"" instead of ""unprofessional website,"" and ""uncensored websites"" instead of ""unsecured websites."" These errors suggest that the writer needs to work on proofreading and editing their work more carefully.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful consideration of the opposing viewpoint. While they acknowledge that some people believe computers have benefits, they do not provide a thorough analysis of these benefits or consider alternative perspectives. This lack of nuance makes the writer's argument feel somewhat one-dimensional.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured essay that presents their opinion on the effects of computers on people. The essay is written in a straightforward and easy-to-follow manner, making it accessible to the target audience.

Strengths:

1.  The student has effectively addressed the three main points mentioned in the prompt: hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and interacting with friends.
2.  The essay is well-organized, with each paragraph focusing on a specific aspect of the benefits of computers.
3.  The student has provided specific examples to support their claims, such as typing and using a mouse to improve hand-eye coordination, and learning about different cultures and places through the internet.
4.  The student has also demonstrated an understanding of the importance of computers in their own life, stating that they are a ""very important part of my life.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. The student relies heavily on simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the writing seem a bit flat.
2.  Some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse"" could be broken down into two separate sentences for easier understanding.
3.  The student could have provided more concrete examples to support their claims. While they mention that learning about different cultures can teach us many things, they could have provided specific examples of what they learned or how it has impacted their life.
4.  The conclusion could be stronger. The student simply restates their main points without providing a clear summary or final thought.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Encourage the student to use more descriptive language and varied vocabulary to make their writing more engaging.
2.  Suggest that the student break down long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones for better clarity.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion and its significance. They have identified the main character's emotional journey and the author's intention behind the final paragraph. However, there are areas where the student's analysis could be improved.

Firstly, the student's explanation of the author's intention is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They state that the author wants Saeng to have a positive view of her new home and look forward to the future, but they do not provide any evidence from the text to support this claim. A more nuanced analysis would consider the themes of adaptation, resilience, and the cyclical nature of life, which are present throughout the story.

Secondly, the student's analysis of the supporting evidence is limited. They only mention one instance where Saeng is sad about her new home, but they do not consider other moments in the story where Saeng's emotions are revealed. For example, they could have discussed the scene where Saeng is hesitant to touch the hibiscus plant, which suggests that she is still adjusting to her new environment.

Lastly, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and attention to grammar. For instance, they use the phrase ""positive views on her new home and positive views in the future,"" which is a bit unclear. A more precise phrase would be ""a more positive outlook on her new home and a sense of hope for the future.""

The student's essay on censorship in libraries demonstrates a good effort to address the topic, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. Here's a breakdown of the student's strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:

1.  The student attempts to address the complexities of censorship, acknowledging that it can be both necessary and problematic.
2.  They provide a clear example of how censorship can lead to a chain reaction, where different groups may have conflicting opinions on what should be censored.
3.  The student also recognizes the importance of tolerance and understanding in a diverse society.
4.  They touch on the idea that young children need guidance and censorship to protect them from inappropriate content.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the student's argument.
2.  The writing is often simplistic and lacks depth, with some sentences feeling like they're disconnected from the rest of the essay.
3.  The student relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""we are all different"" and ""interpret things in different ways,"" without providing concrete examples or evidence to support these claims.
4.  The essay could benefit from more organization and transitions between paragraphs, making it harder to follow the student's train of thought.
5.  The student could have provided more specific examples or anecdotes to support their arguments, making the essay more engaging and convincing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The current introduction is somewhat vague and does not effectively grab the reader's attention. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the writer could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles faced by the builders.

The student has done a good job of identifying the obstacles, including the structural concerns, the safety concerns after the Hindenburg accident, and the impact of nature on the mooring mast. However, the writer could have provided more depth and detail in explaining how these obstacles affected the builders and the project as a whole.

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from using more precise language and avoiding some of the more generic phrases, such as ""the final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir and has attempted to identify and describe the moods created by the author. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the writing quality to a higher level.

Firstly, the student has provided a clear and concise thesis statement that outlines the three moods present in the memoir. The student has also provided specific examples from the text to support their claims, which is a crucial aspect of effective writing. For instance, the student correctly identifies the mood of friendship in paragraph @NUM1, citing the line ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" This shows that the student has a good understanding of how the author's use of language contributes to the overall mood of the story.

However, the student's analysis could be more in-depth and nuanced. For example, in the paragraph discussing the mood of care, the student states that the author's family had a small home but let people stay with them until they could leave. While this is a good observation, the student could have explored the emotional impact of this action on the characters and how it contributes to the overall mood of the story. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the significance of the author's family taking in temporary guests and how it relates to the theme of the memoir.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The essay is written mainly in simple sentences, which can make it seem a bit flat and lacking in depth. For instance, the student could have used more complex sentences to connect their ideas and provide a more cohesive narrative.

Lastly, the student's use of transitions between paragraphs could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the mood of friendship to the mood of care, and then to the mood of happiness. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas and create a more logical flow.

The student has attempted to write about a personal experience where they demonstrated patience, which is in line with the prompt. However, the essay lacks coherence and clarity, making it challenging to fully understand the context and the student's experience. The use of abbreviations and lack of proper grammar and punctuation hinder the overall flow of the essay.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the excessive use of abbreviations and acronyms, such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@NUM1."" These should be replaced with the actual names and numbers to enhance clarity and readability. Additionally, the sentence structure is often fragmented, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

The student attempts to convey their experience of being patient during a long car ride, but the narrative is somewhat disjointed. The inclusion of the baby's crying and the student's difficulty with patience is a good attempt to illustrate the concept of patience, but it could be developed further.

The student's writing also lacks descriptive language and sensory details, which would help to engage the reader and make the experience more relatable. For instance, the student could have described the scenery they saw during the car ride, the sounds they heard, or the emotions they felt.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases and connecting words to improve the flow and coherence. The student jumps abruptly from describing the car ride to stating that their mom was proud of them, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

In terms of content, the student has attempted to address the prompt by discussing patience, but the explanation is somewhat superficial. They could have explored the concept of patience in more depth, providing examples or anecdotes that illustrate its importance.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their claims. For instance, they mention the ease of finding information on a computer compared to a library, which is a valid point. Additionally, the student highlights the benefits of online communication, such as staying in touch with old friends through chat rooms and video chats.

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""Alot of people,"" ""exremely helpful,"" ""goodway,"" and ""betet.""

The student has made an effort to analyze the author's conclusion, but their explanation could be more thorough and accurate. They correctly identify the two major obstacles Saeng faced in the story, which are moving to a new place and failing her arriving test. However, their interpretation of the author's intention behind the conclusion is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student states that the author included the conclusion to show that Saeng will be okay and overcome her problems, but they do not consider other possible reasons for the author's choice.

For instance, the student could have explored the symbolism of the hibiscus plant and its connection to Saeng's determination to retake the test. The fact that the hibiscus is budding in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, suggests a sense of renewal and new beginnings. This could be seen as a powerful symbol of Saeng's resilience and her ability to overcome adversity. The student could have also analyzed the use of the phrase ""when they come back"" and its connection to the idea of Saeng's family returning to their new home, which could be seen as a source of comfort and support for Saeng.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, such as ""obstictes"" instead of ""obstacles,"" ""ariving"" instead of ""arriving,"" and missing articles and conjunctions.

The essay is a personal narrative that effectively uses a true story to illustrate the importance of laughter in relationships. The writer's use of vivid descriptions and anecdotes makes the story engaging and relatable. The writer's voice is clear and authentic, and the use of colloquial expressions, such as ""burn out animal"" and ""winter wonderland,"" adds to the narrative's charm.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's emotions and connection to the story. The writer's love and admiration for their father and his friends are palpable, and the writer's enthusiasm for the story is infectious. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the car's engine and the feeling of sliding on snow, helps to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the story to the importance of laughter in relationships. At times, the writer jumps abruptly from one anecdote to another, making it difficult to follow the narrative's flow. Additionally, some of the sentences could be tightened up for better clarity and concision.

The writer's use of language is generally strong, but there are some errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. For example, the sentence ""It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. Similarly, the sentence ""Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again"" is a bit confusing and could be broken up for easier reading.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and technical accuracy. 

One of the main strengths of the essay is that it identifies two specific obstacles faced by the builders: the stress on the building's frame due to the single cable tether and the transmission of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation. The student also mentions that the steel frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, which shows an understanding of the technical challenges involved.

However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity and organization.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer. For instance, they mention that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles, and that over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. This shows that the student has carefully read and analyzed the excerpt.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the student's writing is often informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""Building a mast is more complicated than you would think, they had to take alot of things into consideration like the dirigible's load and the wind pressure"" contains several errors, including the use of ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and the lack of punctuation. Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the obstacles faced by the builders is somewhat superficial. While they mention that the builders had to consider the dirigible's load and wind pressure, they do not delve deeper into the specific challenges that the builders faced. For example, they do not mention the impact of the dirigible's size or the technical difficulties of constructing a mooring mast.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not provide a clear summary of their main points.

The student also struggles with spelling and grammar, as seen in words like ""yor,"" ""higiens,"" and ""whateverenjoy."" Furthermore, the essay lacks concrete evidence to support the writer's claims, relying heavily on emotional appeals.

To improve, the student should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. They should also strive to provide more concrete evidence to support their arguments and avoid relying on emotional appeals. A clearer structure and more formal language would also enhance the essay's overall effectiveness.

The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer effectively uses the prompt to tell a personal story about a significant event in their life, showcasing their experience of being patient on a cold winter day when they were waiting to get their new dog. 

Strengths:

1. The writer starts the essay with a hook that grabs the reader's attention, mentioning it was one of their ""happyest day of my life."" This effectively sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2. The writer uses descriptive language, such as ""cold winters day"" and ""best dog in the world,"" which helps the reader visualize the scene.
3. The writer attempts to use transitional phrases, such as ""When I got to school"" and ""When school end,"" which shows some understanding of how to structure a narrative.

Weaknesses:

1. The writer struggles with grammar and spelling, using incorrect capitalization and punctuation throughout the essay. For example, ""it was one of my happyest day of my life"" should be ""it was one of my happiest days of my life.""
2. The writer's writing lacks coherence and clarity in some parts. For instance, the sentence ""When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open"" is confusing and contains several errors.
3. The writer could have provided more details about their experience of being patient, such as how they felt or what they did to manage their excitement.
4. The writer's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main point.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Review grammar and spelling rules to improve writing accuracy.
2. Revise the essay to improve coherence and clarity, using transitional phrases and sentences that flow smoothly.
3. Provide more details about the writer's experience of being patient, such as their thoughts and feelings.
4. Revise the conclusion to summarize the main point and reiterate the importance of patience.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks specific details and depth in its analysis. The writer mentions three obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, but fails to provide concrete evidence from the excerpt to support these claims. The writer also uses vague language, such as ""many obstacles"" and ""in order to,"" which does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges faced by the builders.

The writer's first point about fixing the frame of the building to transmit stress to the bottom is not supported by the excerpt, and it is unclear how this relates to allowing dirigibles to dock. The second point about completing the roof before the framing of the mooring mast is also not supported by the excerpt, and it is unclear how this is relevant to the prompt. The third point about making the mast's skeleton out of steel to match the rest of the building is not supported by the excerpt and seems to be an assumption rather than a fact.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing specific details and evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. They should also ensure that their analysis is relevant to the prompt and clearly explains how the obstacles relate to the builders' attempt to allow dirigibles to dock.

Evaluation: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the final paragraph in the story. They have identified the main idea of the paragraph, which is Saeng's prioritization of her new home and her hibiscus over school and the test. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by specific details from the story. The student could have also explored the emotional tone and implications of Saeng's decision more thoroughly.

The student's statement that Saeng's hibiscus will remind her of her old friends is a good observation, but it could be further developed by referencing specific events or moments in the story where Saeng formed connections with her friends. Additionally, the student could have analyzed how Saeng's decision to put off the test reflects her emotional state and her priorities.

The student's conclusion that the narrator used this paragraph to let the reader know how Saeng feels is accurate, but it could be more specific and detailed. For example, the student could have discussed how the narrator's use of the phrase ""vowed silently to herself"" conveys Saeng's determination and confidence.

The student's response to the prompt demonstrates a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but it lacks clarity, coherence, and attention to detail. The student mentions that Saeng will take the test in the spring, which is a correct inference from the last paragraph. However, the student fails to explain why the author chose to conclude the story with this specific paragraph. 

The student also introduces unrelated information about the smell of hibiscus, fried melon, and Big Mac, which distracts from the main point. This lack of focus and coherence makes it difficult to understand the student's reasoning. Furthermore, the student's writing lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which affects the overall clarity of the response.

The student could have benefited from a more in-depth analysis of the story's themes and Saeng's character development.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has attempted to tell a true story where laughter was an essential element, but the narrative is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and poor sentence structure. The essay's content is also somewhat disjointed, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the excessive use of informal language and slang, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. The student's use of capitalization and punctuation is inconsistent, and there are numerous instances of grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. The essay also lacks descriptive language, making it difficult to visualize the events being described.

The student attempts to use humor to engage the reader, but the jokes and pranks seem forced and lack a clear connection to the main theme of the essay. The story jumps abruptly from one event to another, making it hard to follow the narrative flow. The student's use of transitions and connecting words is minimal, which further contributes to the disjointedness of the essay.

Despite these issues, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of laughter in relationships and attempts to provide specific examples to support this claim.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the topic, arguing that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read or watch without censorship. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their position, which is a commendable aspect of their writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to articulate their thoughts and opinions in a straightforward manner. They provide relatable examples, such as comparing TV content to library materials, to illustrate their point. However, the writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The essay jumps between ideas without a clear transition, making it challenging to follow at times.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but their writing lacks depth and nuance. They fail to consider alternative perspectives or provide concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, they mention that people find offensive content entertaining, but they do not explore the potential harm that such content can cause to certain individuals or groups.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay shows some errors in punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure. The writer often uses simplistic sentence structures and relies on informal language, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

The student has identified the author's home as a source of joy and comfort, which is a good starting point. However, the student could have explored other aspects of the memoir that contribute to the overall mood, such as the author's relationships with his neighbors or the way the author's parents' Cuban culture is portrayed.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of content, organization, and writing quality.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified Al Smith's intention to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world and the idea of adding a top hat to accommodate dirigibles. However, the student's explanation of the obstacles is somewhat unclear and lacks specific details. For instance, the statement ""the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame"" is not supported by any evidence from the excerpt. The student also fails to mention the impact of wind on the building's structure, which is a crucial point mentioned in the excerpt.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building"" (should be ""to allow dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building"") and ""the conductor refuling its engine"" (should be ""refueling its engine""). Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and the writing lacks variety and depth.

The student also fails to address the cost of strengthening the steel frame of the Empire State Building, which is a significant point mentioned in the excerpt.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer attempts to identify the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the analysis is limited and lacks depth. 

One of the main issues is the lack of specific information from the excerpt to support the writer's claims. The writer mentions ""violent air currents"" as an obstacle, but there is no evidence from the excerpt to support this claim. In fact, the excerpt does not mention air currents at all. This suggests that the writer may have relied on external knowledge rather than the provided excerpt.

The writer also incorrectly states that the builders didn't check the laws of the city, which is not supported by the excerpt. The excerpt does not mention the builders' knowledge of city laws or their impact on the project. This indicates a lack of understanding of the prompt and the excerpt.

The writer's discussion of public safety is the strongest aspect of the essay. They correctly identify the potential risks of a dirigible accident in a populated city and use a relevant example from history to support their claim. However, this section could be strengthened by more specific analysis and connection to the excerpt.

However, the writing could be improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific details from the passage to support the argument. For example, the student mentions the high desert of California in June, which effectively illustrates the harsh conditions the cyclist is facing. This shows that the student is able to analyze the setting and its impact on the character.

However, the writing could be more polished. The sentence structure is often simple and lacks variety, which makes the text feel a bit flat. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and clear. For instance, the sentence ""You start to panic and lose control over yourself"" could be rephrased to make it more specific and detailed.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more evidence from the passage to support their argument.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their argument. Here are some specific observations and suggestions:

For instance, ""I think that this kaind of books they maybe sometimes offend to some people"" should be ""I think that this kind of book may sometimes offend some people."" These errors detract from the overall coherence and credibility of the essay.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: The student's writing is often unclear and lacks coherence. For example, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. The student jumps between different topics, such as books, music, and movies, without a clear thread to tie them together.

3. **Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure. The student starts with a quote, but fails to effectively incorporate it into the rest of the essay. The body paragraphs are not well-organized, and the student jumps between different ideas without a clear conclusion.

4. **Supporting Evidence**: While the student attempts to provide supporting evidence, it is often anecdotal and lacks concrete examples. For instance, the statement ""I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs"" is unclear and lacks specific details.

5. **Tone and Style**: The student's tone is often inconsistent, veering between a persuasive tone and a more casual, conversational tone. The use of phrases like ""I don't want or people want"" and ""us like parents"" detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

6. **Language and Vocabulary**: The student's vocabulary is limited, and they rely on simplistic language to convey their ideas. For instance, the use of ""kaind"" instead of ""kind"" and ""appropiate"" instead of ""appropriate"" detract from the overall quality of the essay.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. The student relies heavily on simple sentences and basic sentence structures, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and to the point. For example, the sentence ""The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech"" could be rephrased to ""The right to free speech is a fundamental reason why censorship in libraries is unjust.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis in their arguments.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to describe the negative impact of the setting on the cyclist. The writer mentions the ""deserted towns, disowned factories, and hills"" that the cyclist encounters, which effectively conveys the desolate and unforgiving nature of the environment. The use of sensory details, such as the ""high deserts of California in June,"" helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

The writer also does a good job of showing the cyclist's emotional state through their actions and dialogue. For example, the line ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" effectively conveys the cyclist's desperation and dehydration. Additionally, the line ""I had an overwhelming and buy some bait"" is a good example of the cyclist's relief and gratitude when finding water.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The essay could benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. For example, the sentence ""With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated"" could be rephrased to make it clearer and more concise.

Additionally, there are some grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, the word ""cycalrst"" should be spelled ""cyclist,"" and the phrase ""buy some bait"" is likely a typo and should be ""buy some bait"" is not a logical thing to say in this context, it should be ""buy some bait"" is not a logical thing to say in this context, it should be ""buy some food"" or something similar.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and relatable argument, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their perspective. The writer's use of analogies, such as the cookie example, is a good attempt to illustrate their point, but it may not be the most effective way to address the complex issue of censorship.

One of the primary concerns with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas, making it challenging to follow their train of thought. For instance, the transition from the cookie analogy to the story about the teacher giving gum to a friend seems abrupt and unrelated to the main topic. The writer also struggles to connect their personal experiences to the broader issue of censorship in libraries.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is informal, which may detract from the overall impact of their argument. The use of phrases like ""now would it"" and ""i was mad"" creates a tone that is more suitable for a casual conversation than a persuasive essay. Additionally, the writer's writing lacks depth and nuance, failing to provide concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.

However, the writer shows some potential in their ability to think critically and make connections between their personal experiences and the issue at hand. The example of the third person watching a fight and not having the right to record it is a good attempt to illustrate a situation where censorship might be justified.

To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, using more formal language, and providing concrete examples to support their arguments. They should also strive to connect their personal experiences to the broader issue of censorship in a more meaningful way.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, there are areas where the student's writing could be improved. 

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the safety concerns of the New York people as one of the obstacles. This is supported by the excerpt, which mentions the potential risks of hydrogen catching fire. However, the student could have provided more specific information from the excerpt to strengthen their argument. For instance, they could have mentioned the violent air currents that affected the winds on top of the building, as stated in the excerpt.

Secondly, the student has also correctly identified the law against airships flying too low over urban areas as another obstacle. This is also supported by the excerpt, which mentions that the idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared. However, the student could have provided more context about this law and its impact on the builders' plans.

Lastly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The sentence structure is simple, and the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the sentence ""Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" could be rephrased to better connect with the previous idea.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept that the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in various ways. However, the essay lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought. The student has provided three examples from the story to support their conclusion, but the transitions between these examples are abrupt and lack connecting sentences to create a cohesive narrative.

The student has effectively used descriptive language to describe the setting, such as ""hot place similar to a desert"" and ""rocky roads and windy paths."" These descriptions help the reader visualize the environment and understand how it affects the cyclist. Additionally, the student has used quotes from the story to provide evidence, such as ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,"" which effectively illustrates the impact of the setting on the cyclist.

However, the student could improve by providing more analysis and explanation of how the setting affects the cyclist. For instance, they could discuss how the heat and dehydration affect the cyclist's physical state or how the rocky roads and windy paths impact the cyclist's ability to navigate. Furthermore, the student could use more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and create a smoother flow of ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided specific examples from the memoir to support their answer. However, there are areas where the student's writing could be improved to reach a higher level of quality. 

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is clear and concise, stating that Narciso Rodriguez creates a loving mood in the memoir. The student then supports this claim with three specific examples: being grateful to his parents, welcoming family in their home, and celebrating special occasions with their family. 

However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis in their explanation. For instance, when discussing being grateful to his parents, the student could have explored how this gratitude is shown through specific actions or events in the memoir, rather than just stating that @CAPS1 is grateful. Similarly, when discussing welcoming family in their home, the student could have provided more context about what this means in terms of the family's values and relationships.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs. This makes the essay feel a bit disjointed and lacking in flow.

Finally, the student could have provided more analysis of the author's purpose in creating a loving mood. Why is this mood important to the memoir? What does it reveal about the author's character or experiences? Answering these questions would have taken the essay to a higher level of depth and analysis.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, although it is not explicitly stated in the prompt, the student has inferred the information from the context. The student has identified three main obstacles: stress from the mass and wind pressure on the building's foundation, safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen, and the impact of violent air currents on the dirigible's mooring.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, they could have mentioned the specific dimensions of the building or the type of materials used in its construction. Secondly, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have discussed the potential consequences of the building's foundation being unable to withstand the stress from the dirigible and wind pressure.

Additionally, the student could have improved the clarity and coherence of their writing. The sentence ""It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. The student could also have used transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to their potential offensiveness. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of personal experience and observations to support their argument. They mention specific examples of how they have used library resources for school projects and how they believe that libraries provide valuable information on various topics, including history. This shows that the student has a practical understanding of the importance of libraries and the role they play in education.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the issue. At times, their arguments feel simplistic and lack depth. For example, when discussing the idea that people may not like certain books or movies, the student suggests that they simply ""don't read it"" or ""look for something else more interesting."" While this is a valid point, it oversimplifies the complexities of censorship and the potential impact it can have on individuals and communities.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing punctuation. These errors can make the essay difficult to follow and detract from the student's overall message.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the ideas between paragraphs. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of libraries to talking about people overreacting to certain materials. A more cohesive and logical flow of ideas would make the essay more engaging and easier to follow.

Finally, the student's conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be more effectively summarized. The student restates their opinion and then ends the essay without providing a final thought or call to action. A more effective conclusion would leave the reader with something to think about or a lasting impression.

They have provided specific examples from the text to support their conclusion, which is a strong aspect of their essay. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain how the setting affects the character. For instance, when discussing the ""ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule,"" the student correctly concludes that the character is confused. This shows that the student can analyze the setting and its impact on the character. Similarly, when discussing the hot weather, the student correctly notes that the water in the bottle feels ""@NUM1 degrees"" and that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. This demonstrates the student's ability to make connections between the setting and the character's experience.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. For example, the sentence ""These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination"" is a bit vague and could be more specific. The student could have elaborated on how the different conditions (harsh setting, hot weather, and changing terrain) specifically affected the cyclist's journey. Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. For instance, the sentence ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" could be rephrased to make it clearer how this information relates to the rest of the paragraph.

The student's response attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The student seems to misunderstand the author's intention behind concluding the story with the given paragraph. The student's explanation is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura,"" which should be ""He was talking about how beautiful nature was."" Furthermore, the student's reasoning is not well-supported by evidence from the story.

The student's statement, ""He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant,"" is a misinterpretation of the story. The passage actually suggests that Saeng is motivated to retake the test because she wants to be with her hibiscus plant in the garden, not because she loves nature. This misinterpretation undermines the student's argument.

The student's conclusion, ""That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature,"" is also flawed.

The writer's personal experience with their grandparents is relatable and well-structured, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of vivid details and sensory descriptions, such as the feeling of the hose's nozzle and the sound of the engine, helps to create a strong connection with the reader.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance humor and sentimentality. The writer's account of accidentally soaking their grandfather with a hose is a hilarious and memorable moment, and the subsequent scene of the grandfather's reaction is well-portrayed. The writer's use of dialogue, such as the grandfather's question about the hose and the writer's response, adds to the authenticity of the story.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. Additionally, some of the paragraphs could be more clearly linked to the main theme of the essay. The writer jumps abruptly from the story of the hose to the tradition of drinking root beer floats and watching movies together.

For example, the sentence ""Well of course I didn't because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my @CAPS6"" is a run-on sentence that could be broken up for clarity.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use rhetorical questions to engage the reader and make their point more relatable.

For instance, the statement ""Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3"" is vague and does not provide concrete evidence.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more organization and coherence.

The essay provides a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer has identified the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, specifically the framing of the building and its height. However, the explanation of these obstacles is somewhat vague and lacks specific details from the excerpt.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise sentences. The writer often uses run-on sentences and phrases that make it difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, the first sentence is a good start, but the second sentence is a long and convoluted phrase that could be broken down into simpler sentences for better clarity. Additionally, the writer often uses vague terms such as ""stress"" and ""issues"" without explaining what they mean in the context of the building's structure.

The writer also struggles to provide specific information from the excerpt to support their claims. While they mention that the building was initially designed to be @NUM1 floors, they do not explain how this relates to the docking of dirigibles. Furthermore, they state that the building needed an observation room and a boarding area, but do not provide any evidence from the excerpt to support this claim.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the framing of the building to the height of the building, without explaining how these two ideas are related. Additionally, the writer repeats themselves in the second paragraph, stating that the builders had many obstacles, including adding height to the building, and then reiterating that the foremost problem was the framing of the building.

To improve this essay, the writer should focus on breaking down long sentences into simpler ones, providing clear and concise explanations, and using specific details from the excerpt to support their claims. They should also work on connecting their ideas more smoothly and avoiding repetition.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on censorship in libraries. However, their essay lacks a clear and well-structured argument. The student's writing is primarily composed of fragmented sentences and lacks transitional phrases to connect their ideas. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide a personal example from their experience, which shows that they can think critically about the issue. The mention of the movie ""@CAPS1"" is a good attempt to support their argument, but it would be more effective if they had provided more context or analysis about why this movie is an example of something that should be censored.

The student's argument is also somewhat unclear. They state that only ""real offensive stuff"" should be censored, but they do not define what they mean by ""real offensive stuff."" This lack of clarity makes it difficult for the reader to understand their position. Additionally, the student's statement that they wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not is a valid point, but it does not contribute to a clear argument about censorship.

The student's writing also contains some grammatical errors and lacks proper punctuation. For example, the sentence ""Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The @CAPS1 and its a guy that made fun of a special olympic team, then lied about having a dissability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine."" is a run-on sentence that is difficult to follow.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in attempting to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. 

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the author's mood as happy and has provided specific examples from the memoir to support this claim. The mention of Narciso's positive experiences with his landlord and daughter, as well as his close relationships with his family and friends, effectively convey a sense of happiness and warmth. Additionally, the student has noted the author's appreciation for the cultural diversity in his neighborhood, which further contributes to the overall positive mood.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. For instance, the sentence ""Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate"" could be rephrased to ""The author's mood in the memoir appears to be happy and grateful."" Furthermore, the student could have explored more depth in their analysis by examining the author's use of language, imagery, or other literary devices that contribute to the mood.

Moreover, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing Narciso's relationships to his neighborhood's cultural diversity, and the connection between these ideas is not explicitly stated. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to link these ideas more smoothly.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly related to the thesis statement. The final sentence, while attempting to summarize the author's sentiment, feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but lacks a clear and focused analysis. The student provides a few quotes from the memoir, but they do not effectively support a cohesive argument about the mood. The quotes seem to be randomly selected and do not demonstrate a clear understanding of the author's tone or emotional atmosphere.

The student starts by stating that the author had no problem finding a house, but this is not supported by the quotes provided. The quotes actually suggest a sense of warmth and welcoming, as the author's parents shared cooking duties and celebrated the arrival of new refugees. However, the student fails to connect these quotes to the overall mood of the memoir.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""they're"" instead of ""their"" and ""eternally greatful"" instead of ""eternally grateful."" Additionally, the student's transitions between sentences are abrupt, and the essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The writer attempts to provide a personal anecdote about patience, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas and sentences without connecting them logically.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The writer uses informal language, such as ""yah,"" ""lll,"" and ""probebly,"" which detract from the overall quality of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of verb tenses.

The writer also struggles to provide specific examples to support their claims about patience. The anecdote about the friend waiting for the writer to pick up a stray cat is unclear and lacks detail. The writer fails to explain why this experience demonstrates patience or how it relates to the concept of patience.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the writer's lack of patience to describing a friend's patience. The writer also fails to provide a clear conclusion or summary of the main point.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir, but their analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. They correctly identify the author's use of informal language and personal anecdotes as contributing to a laid-back mood. However, their explanation could be more detailed and supported by specific examples from the memoir. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""I belive,"" ""demostraigted,"" ""dose,"" and ""soud."" Additionally, the student's use of capitalization is inconsistent, as seen in the use of ""{CAPS1}"" which is not a standard way to denote capitalization.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the concept of patience, but their writing lacks depth and coherence. The essay starts with a strong statement about the student's lack of patience, but the explanation that follows is somewhat vague and lacks specific examples. The student attempts to provide a contrast by mentioning a situation where they can wait, but this example seems unrelated to the concept of patience and appears to be more about the student's preference for certain activities.

One of the main issues with the essay is the use of informal language and tone, which may not be suitable for a formal writing assignment. The use of phrases like ""Let me get one thing straight"" and ""boreing"" detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to make the reader more engaged.

The student's writing also lacks organization and structure.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that libraries should only contain books and not other forms of media like movies and music. The writer's opinion is based on a simplistic view of what a library should be, suggesting that if libraries include other materials, people will lose interest in books. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of supporting evidence. The writer relies heavily on personal opinions and assumptions, stating that people would lose interest in books if movies and music were included in libraries. This claim is not substantiated with any concrete examples or research. Furthermore, the writer fails to consider the potential benefits of including other forms of media in libraries, such as providing a one-stop-shop for community members or promoting literacy through diverse forms of storytelling.

The writer also demonstrates a limited understanding of the concept of censorship. They argue that if one person has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone else should have the same right. However, this oversimplifies the complexities of censorship and ignores the importance of considering the context and impact of removing certain materials from a library.

In terms of organization and coherence, the essay is somewhat disorganized and lacks a clear structure. The writer jumps between ideas and fails to provide a clear thesis statement. The writing style is also simplistic, with short sentences and a lack of varied vocabulary.

The writer does demonstrate some understanding of the importance of books, stating that they are the ""oldest but most creative way to express yourself or tell a story."" However, this insight is not fully developed or supported with evidence.

Evaluation: The student's response demonstrates a good attempt to analyze the author's choice of concluding paragraph, but it lacks depth and clarity. The student's explanation is brief and does not effectively connect the paragraph to the rest of the story. The student's understanding of the paragraph's meaning is also somewhat inaccurate, as the paragraph does not explicitly state that the geese returning and the flower budding are the reasons for the author's decision to retake the test. Instead, the paragraph suggests that the author is motivated by a personal connection to the flower and the cycle of nature.

The student's response could be improved by providing more context from the story and explaining how the author's decision to retake the test is connected to the themes and events of the narrative. For example, the student could discuss how the author's relationship with the flower and the natural world is a recurring theme throughout the story, and how the author's decision to retake the test is a personal and emotional one.

One of the major strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to acknowledge the opposing view, as mentioned in the prompt. The writer correctly identifies the concern that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, interacting with family and friends, and enjoying nature. However, the writer fails to provide a clear and convincing argument to support their own opinion.

The writer's writing style is informal, with numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and lack of proper punctuation. For instance, the writer uses ""I belive"" instead of ""I believe,"" ""mabey"" instead of ""maybe,"" and ""rarley"" instead of ""rarely."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The writer also struggles to provide concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention that most adults do not play games on the computer, they fail to provide a clear explanation of how this supports their opinion. Additionally, the writer's statement that ""the internet has open alot of new enchanced technology"" is unclear and lacks specificity.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a thoughtful and relatable perspective on the topic. The writer acknowledges the complexity of the issue and attempts to provide a balanced view by considering both sides of the argument. However, the essay could benefit from more organization, clarity, and effective use of transitional phrases to connect ideas.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal experience to support their argument. The mention of the ""dunkirk library"" and the separate room for adult books is a good example of how real-life experiences can be used to illustrate a point. The writer also shows an understanding of the potential consequences of censorship, such as children seeking out information from other sources.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more concrete evidence and specific examples to support the writer's claims. For instance, the writer states that some people would be mad about a vote on censorship, but it would be helpful to provide more context or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the writer's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be more effectively tied to the rest of the essay.

The writer attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and limited use of specific information from the excerpt. 

One of the primary issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, such as ""A mistake,"" ""And realistic idea,"" ""obsticle,"" ""faced in Attempt,"" ""unsafeness,"" and ""A that height Are."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing. Furthermore, the writer fails to provide a clear and logical structure, making it difficult to follow the argument.

In terms of content, the writer identifies two potential obstacles: the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas and the unsafeness of having airships dock at the Empire State Building due to varying winds. However, the writer fails to provide specific information from the excerpt to support these claims. The writer also uses vague terms such as ""potentially horrific if it failed"" and ""potentially dangerous,"" which do not add much depth to the argument.

To improve, the writer should focus on revising the essay to address the grammatical errors, create a clear and logical structure, and provide more specific information from the excerpt to support the claims.

The use of phrases such as ""he explains how life was and how he loved it so much"" and ""he shows in his writing all the warm kind of feelings he had as a child"" is too vague and does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the memoir's content.

Furthermore, the student incorrectly states that the author uses parentheses to show or talk about how much he loved different kinds of things in paragraph @NUM1.

The student's writing is generally clear and easy to follow, with a logical structure that effectively conveys their message.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use specific examples and statistics to support their arguments. For instance, they mention that ""studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such as '@CAPS1' 'twitter', and 'aol'.""

However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the technical challenges posed by the building's foundation and the blimp's size. The student also correctly mentions the safety concerns related to the flammability of hydrogen and the potential consequences of an accident. The reference to the Hindenburg explosion is a good example of how the student is using specific information from the excerpt to support their argument.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. Some sentences are worded awkwardly, and there are a few grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below"" could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles faced by the builders, rather than simply listing them.

Furthermore, the student could have taken the opportunity to provide more depth and nuance to their argument. For example, they could have discussed the potential economic or logistical challenges of building a docking station for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.

The student provides specific details from the excerpt, such as the cost of modifying the building's frame and the failure of the Columbia and the Los Angeles to dock due to strong winds. However, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the significance of these obstacles.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some areas where the writing could be more polished. For example, the sentence ""In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas"" could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to connect the ideas between paragraphs.

The student's conclusion is clear and concise, but it could be more effective if it were more explicitly linked to the rest of the essay. The student states that the builders could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower, but this conclusion could be more effectively supported by summarizing the obstacles discussed in the essay.

Evaluation:

The essay is a personal narrative about a time when the writer demonstrated patience. The writer recounts a story about a family trip to their grandparents' house, where they had to wait for a long time in the car. The writer's mom reminds them to be patient, but the writer struggles to stay awake and focused.

Strengths:

* The writer has attempted to use descriptive language, such as ""beutiful @DATE1,"" ""fierce, and starving,"" and ""yum,"" which shows some creativity and imagination.
* The writer has tried to incorporate sensory details, like the sound of the stomach growling and the feeling of excitement.
* The writer has attempted to use dialogue, which adds a conversational tone to the essay.

Weaknesses:

* The writing is often fragmented and lacks coherence, with many short sentences and abrupt transitions.
* The writer struggles with spelling and grammar, with several errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""beutiful,"" ""pb&j sandwiches,"" ""Saltandvinager,"" ""jolepenyo ceddar,"" ""rocks shore,"" ""tierd,"" ""scowse"").
* The writer's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with some proper nouns and words in all capital letters (e.g., ""@CAPS1,"" ""@CAPS2,"" ""@CAPS3"").
* The writer's narrative is often disjointed and lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow at times.
* The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, with many simple words and phrases repeated throughout the essay.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer attempts to provide a personal anecdote about a time when they were patient, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks clarity. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing their desire for the X-Men game to receiving it as a gift, without providing a clear connection between the two events.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The writer fails to provide a clear introduction, body, or conclusion, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The sentences are also riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time"" and ""I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer.""

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is simplistic and lacks descriptive details. The essay could benefit from more vivid descriptions and sensory details to help the reader visualize the scene. For example, instead of saying ""I got down stairs so fast,"" the writer could describe the excitement and anticipation they felt as they rushed downstairs.

Additionally, the writer could have taken the opportunity to explain how their experience of waiting for the game taught them the value of patience. This would have added depth and insight to the essay, making it more engaging and meaningful.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student could have provided more nuanced and balanced arguments, acknowledging the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use. The essay relies heavily on quotes from experts, which, while relevant, could be integrated more smoothly into the text. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, and there are minor grammatical errors.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and has made an effort to use relevant vocabulary, such as ""hand-eye coordination"" and ""webchat service.""

The essay effectively conveys the importance of laughter in relationships and life, using a personal anecdote to illustrate its significance. The writer's use of vivid descriptions and sensory details, such as ""rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs"" and ""nose dive and start tumbling down the hill,"" effectively engages the reader and makes the story more relatable. The writer also demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt by highlighting the benefits of laughter in relationships and its impact on one's life.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the anecdote to the prompt. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny,"" feel like non-sequiturs and disrupt the flow of the essay. The writer could have also benefited from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to create a more dynamic writing style.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more depth and analysis of the significance of the story, rather than simply stating its importance. For example, the writer could have explored how the experience with the puppy taught them a valuable lesson about the importance of laughter or how it affected their relationship with their family members.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of mood in literature and attempts to apply it to the memoir. However, their analysis is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They identify two moods, whistful and greatful, but do not provide sufficient evidence from the text to support their claim. The student also uses informal language and makes grammatical errors, such as the use of ""I'd call"" and ""Yes, the author creates."" Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more organization and clarity, as the transitions between ideas are not smooth.

The student's analysis of the memoir is also limited to only two paragraphs, and they do not provide specific examples from the text to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the whistful mood, they mention the author's childhood home, friends, and family, but do not provide any specific details or quotes from the text. Similarly, when discussing the greatful mood, they mention the author's thanks and descriptions of their parents, but again do not provide any specific examples.

To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed analysis of the text, using quotes and examples to support their claims. They should also work on using more formal language and avoiding grammatical errors.

The student's answer is brief and does not provide concrete evidence from the memoir to support their claim. They mention that the author knew when to be excited and when not to be excited, but they do not provide any specific examples from the text to illustrate this point. The student also uses vague phrases such as ""pretty good"" and ""good story,"" which do not provide a clear understanding of the mood created by the author.

The student's use of transition words and phrases, such as ""so to me,"" is informal and detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the author's intention in concluding the story with the given paragraph. They correctly identify the theme of hope and the connection between the natural world and the protagonist's emotions. However, their analysis could be more nuanced and supported by specific details from the story.

The student mentions that the geese and the hibiscus make the protagonist feel more at home, but they do not explain why these specific elements are significant. For instance, they could have discussed how the geese's return symbolizes a sense of routine and normalcy, which is something the protagonist is longing for. Similarly, they could have elaborated on how the hibiscus's budding represents new life and renewal, which contrasts with the protagonist's current state of uncertainty and isolation.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and sentence structure. For example, instead of saying ""This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved,"" they could rephrase it to ""The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus evoke a sense of familiarity and comfort, reminiscent of the protagonist's life before the move.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the writer's claims, which is a positive aspect of the essay. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more organized structure. The writer jumps between different points without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the writer starts by mentioning the architects' inability to drop a mooring mast on the roof, then shifts to the concern of safety, and finally concludes with the obstacle of nature itself. A more logical and cohesive structure would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

Secondly, the writer could provide more analysis and explanation of the obstacles mentioned. While the writer lists the obstacles, they do not delve deeper into the significance or impact of these obstacles on the builders. For example, the writer mentions that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, but does not explain why this is a significant challenge.

Lastly, the writer could improve the writing style by avoiding repetitive phrases such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2."" These phrases are unnecessary and disrupt the flow of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by attempting to identify the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific evidence from the text. The student has correctly identified the author's intention to create a ""reminiscent/wistful mood"" but could have explored this idea further by examining more specific details from the text.

The student has provided a relevant quote from the memoir, which is a good start. However, the analysis of the quote is somewhat superficial and does not fully explain how the quote contributes to the overall mood of the memoir. For example, the student could have discussed how the description of the parents sharing cooking duties and passing on their culinary skills creates a sense of warmth and coziness, which contributes to the wistful mood.

Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the language and literary devices used by the author to create the mood. For instance, the student could have discussed how the use of words like ""small little"" to describe the house creates a sense of nostalgia, or how the use of the phrase ""unwittingly passed on"" suggests a sense of appreciation and gratitude.

They correctly identify the key elements of the story, such as Saeng's family moving to the United States from Vietnam and her failed driving test. However, their explanation of the author's decision to conclude the story with the given paragraph is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth.

The student states that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng's family moved to the United States from Vietnam. While this is a relevant detail, it is not the primary reason for the story's conclusion. The student also mentions that Saeng uses the plant for good luck, which is a good observation, but they do not fully explain how this relates to the story's conclusion.

A more accurate analysis would be that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides a sense of closure and resolution for Saeng's character. The image of Saeng looking forward to taking her driving test again in the spring, surrounded by the blooming hibiscus plant, suggests that she has learned from her failure and is determined to try again. This conclusion also highlights the themes of perseverance and hope that are present throughout the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples of how computers are beneficial, such as using them for research, playing games, and staying in touch with distant relatives. The use of a personal anecdote about using a webcam to stay in touch with their grandma is a good way to make the essay more relatable and engaging.

However, the essay could benefit from more development and support for the student's arguments. The student mentions that computers are a great source of knowledge, but does not provide any evidence to back up this claim. Additionally, the student could have explored the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, as mentioned in the prompt.

The student has identified three main challenges: the stress on the building's frame, the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, and safety concerns. 

The student's explanation of the first challenge is somewhat unclear, as they mention that a thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame, but do not provide a clear connection to the cost of strengthening the frame. The second challenge is also somewhat vague, as the student mentions the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, but does not provide specific information from the excerpt to support this claim. The third challenge, safety concerns, is the most clearly explained, as the student mentions the devastating impact of an accident in downtown New York.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but it could be improved in several areas. The writer has attempted to provide a personal anecdote about patience, but the narrative is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence. The essay jumps abruptly from the writer's initial encounter with the puppy to the day they finally take the puppy home, without a clear connection between the two events.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to convey their enthusiasm and excitement about getting a new puppy. The use of descriptive language, such as ""my favorite,"" ""raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and ""my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1,"" effectively conveys the writer's emotions and attachment to the puppy.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to organization and coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas and events without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative. Additionally, some sentences are incomplete or lack clarity, such as ""But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow."" It is unclear who ""he"" refers to in this sentence.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and specific examples of patience. While the writer mentions that they had to wait a whole week to take the puppy home, they do not elaborate on how they demonstrated patience during this time. The essay could also benefit from more analysis and reflection on the concept of patience, rather than simply stating that ""if you want something bad enough patient is the key.""

Evaluation:

The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and the author's quote, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the importance of respecting others' personal belongings and feelings, which is a crucial aspect of the argument against censorship. However, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and simplistic sentence structures.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of personal experiences to connect with the reader. The writer shares a touching story about a treasured item given by a loved one, which effectively conveys the emotional significance of personal belongings. This narrative approach helps to establish empathy and understanding, making the argument more relatable and engaging.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writing is often fragmented, with short, disconnected sentences that make it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and the sentence structure is often simplistic. The writer could benefit from varying sentence length and complexity to create a more dynamic and engaging narrative.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more effective use of evidence to support the argument. While the writer mentions Katherine Paterson's quote, they do not fully explore its implications or provide additional evidence to reinforce their position. The writer also relies heavily on personal anecdotes, which, while effective, could be supplemented with more concrete examples or research to strengthen the argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is often informal and lacks precision. For instance, the use of ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""senceitive"" instead of ""sensitive"" detracts from the overall quality of the writing. The writer should strive to use more formal language and avoid contractions to create a more polished and professional tone.

The student's response attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and clarity. The student correctly identifies the hibiscus as a significant element in the story, but fails to provide a clear explanation for why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The student also makes an assumption that the story was ""mostly talking about the hibiscus,"" which is not entirely accurate. The story is actually about Saeng's journey and her decision to take a test. The student also misinterprets the significance of the hibiscus, stating that it reminds Saeng of her homeland in the past, which is not explicitly stated in the provided paragraph. 

The student could have provided a more effective response by analyzing the symbolism of the hibiscus and its connection to Saeng's decision to retake the test. For example, the student could have discussed how the hibiscus represents a new beginning or a fresh start, which aligns with Saeng's determination to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus is budding.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the essay. However, there are areas where the analysis could be improved to make it more comprehensive and effective. 

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the hot California day in June as a challenging setting for the cyclist, which can be inferred from the statement ""To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot."" This shows that the student is aware of how the setting can impact the character's emotions and physical state. 

However, the student could have provided more specific details from the text to support their analysis. For instance, they could have mentioned how the heat affects the cyclist's physical condition, such as feeling exhausted or dehydrated, which would have added more depth to their argument.

The student also correctly identifies the speed limit and the cyclist's speed as a factor that affects the cyclist's confidence. The quote ""The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph"" effectively illustrates this point, as it shows the cyclist's slow speed in relation to the speed limit, making them feel worried. This is a good example of how the student has used textual evidence to support their analysis.

However, the student's analysis of the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory is somewhat unclear. They mention that the factory causes the cyclist to lose hope, but they do not provide a clear explanation of how this setting affects the cyclist. The quote ""A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" seems to be a vivid description of the setting, but it is not directly linked to the cyclist's emotions or actions.

To improve their analysis, the student could have provided more context about how the abandoned factory affects the cyclist's mental state or how it relates to the overall plot. This would have made their argument more convincing and well-supported.

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt, but their response lacks depth and clarity. They have identified the mood as ""happy"" but fail to provide sufficient evidence from the memoir to support this claim. The student mentions that the author does not use ""depressing words or ephrasses,"" but this is a vague statement and does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the text. Furthermore, the student's statement that the author had a ""great family"" and enjoyed their lifestyle and home is not supported by any specific details from the memoir.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""he doesn't use depressing words or ephrasses"" (should be ""depressing words or epithets"") and ""he had stateted"" (should be ""he stated""). Additionally, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

To improve, the student should focus on providing specific examples from the memoir to support their claims and demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the author's intended mood. They should also work on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and organization.

Evaluation:

The essay is a personal narrative that effectively tells a true story about the power of laughter in breaking down barriers and bringing people together. The writer's use of descriptive language and vivid details helps the reader visualize the scenes and feel the emotions of the characters.

Strengths:

1.  The writer starts the essay with a hook that grabs the reader's attention, mentioning a famous quote about laughter being the shortest distance between two people. This sets the tone for the rest of the essay and shows the writer's understanding of the importance of laughter.
2.  The writer uses sensory details to describe the scene, such as the mom's frown and the sound of the kids cracking up in class. This helps the reader feel like they are part of the story.
3.  The writer shows, rather than tells, the impact of laughter on the characters. For example, when the new student finally gets the joke, the writer describes her laughter as ""ohhhh I get it"" and then she starts to laugh. This shows the reader how laughter can bring people together and create a sense of connection.
4.  The writer also shows the impact of laughter on the mom, who is revealed to be in a bad mood due to a recent loss. The writer's joke helps her to smile and laugh, which is a powerful moment in the story.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer could have provided more context about the mom's situation and why she was in a bad mood. This would have helped the reader understand the significance of the writer's joke and its impact on the mom.
2.  Some of the sentences are a bit choppy and could be connected more smoothly. For example, the transition between the scene at school and the scene at the writer's friend's house could be smoother.
3.  The writer could have used more descriptive language to describe the setting and characters. For example, what did the writer's friend's house look like? What was the atmosphere like during dinner?

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has provided examples of patient individuals, which is in line with the prompt's requirements. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanation of what patience means. The student seems to be more focused on listing examples rather than providing a cohesive and well-structured argument.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the father's camera to the mother's slippers, without connecting the ideas or providing a clear thesis statement. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought and understand their perspective on patience.

Furthermore, the student's definition of patience is limited and oversimplified. They mention that patient people are ""very responsible,"" but this is not a clear or accurate definition of patience. The student could have explored other aspects of patience, such as being understanding and tolerant, as mentioned in the prompt.

The writing itself is simple and lacks descriptive language. The student uses basic sentence structures and does not provide vivid details to support their examples. For instance, instead of simply stating that the father waited a whole year for a lens, the student could have described the father's anticipation and excitement as he waited for the lens.

In terms of mechanics, the essay has some grammatical errors, such as the use of ""My mom is patient too"" which is a repetitive statement, and ""I’m proud to have such patient parent"" which is a grammatically incorrect sentence.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by identifying the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific evidence from the text. The student has correctly identified the mood as calm and sad, but the reasoning behind this conclusion is somewhat simplistic and lacks concrete examples from the memoir.

The student mentions that the author is remembering her home from the past, which makes her sad, but this is not a clear connection to the text. The student also interprets the phrase ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family"" as a sign of sadness, possibly due to the death of the parents. While this is a possible interpretation, it is not explicitly supported by the text, and the student does not provide any evidence to back up this claim.

To improve, the student could have provided more specific quotes or examples from the memoir to support their analysis.

The essay is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks depth and specific examples to support the student's claims. The student's writing is also informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student is able to recall a specific experience (the meap) and explain how they demonstrated patience during that time. However, the student could have provided more details about the situation and how they felt during that time. For example, they could have described how they felt when they were waiting for others to finish or how they managed to stay calm and focused.

For example, the sentence ""When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks variety and could benefit from more descriptive language. For example, instead of saying ""I was patient,"" the student could have described how they felt or what they did to demonstrate patience.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more detailed and nuanced analysis of the obstacles faced by the builders.

Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the law outlawing dirigibles flying low near urban areas, such as who enacted the law and when.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas.

The student mentions that the building was not stable enough to moor an airship, but they do not provide any evidence from the excerpt to back this claim.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has provided a well-structured argument in favor of censorship in libraries. The essay begins with a thought-provoking statement from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their argument, acknowledging the presence of offensive materials in libraries and the importance of freedom of speech and religion.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The student jumps between ideas and sometimes uses vague language, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, the transition from discussing the freedom of speech and religion to the idea of people having the right to censor library materials feels abrupt.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. There are several instances of run-on sentences, missing articles, and incorrect verb tenses. For example, ""Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive?"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and grammar.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on simple sentences. While this is not uncommon at the middle school level, it would be beneficial for the student to incorporate more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to enhance their writing.

The student's conclusion is somewhat unclear, as they seem to contradict themselves by stating that censorship is a ""spectacular idea"" while also acknowledging that it can be taken too far. A more cohesive conclusion that ties together the main points and reiterates the thesis statement would strengthen the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in identifying the moods created by the author in the memoir. They have provided specific examples from the text to support their claims, which is a crucial aspect of effective analysis. However, there are areas where the student's writing can be improved.

Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the author's happiness to sadness, without a clear transition between the two ideas. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. To improve this, the student could use transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas.

Secondly, the student's analysis could be more in-depth. While they mention specific examples, they do not provide much context or explanation for why these examples support their claims. For instance, when discussing the author's happiness, the student could explain how the author's use of language, such as the tone and vocabulary, contributes to this mood. Similarly, when discussing the author's sadness, the student could analyze how the author's description of their experience affects the reader's emotional response.

Lastly, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""he sounded a little deppressed"" could be rephrased to ""he seemed melancholic"" or ""he expressed a sense of loss,"" which would demonstrate a more advanced understanding of language.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal anecdote, but it falls short in several areas. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of coherence. The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and the sentence structure is often simplistic. The essay's organization is also unclear, making it difficult to follow the student's narrative.

One of the main issues with the essay is the student's struggle with spelling and grammar. Words like ""fitted,"" ""league,"" ""so,"" and ""ok"" are misspelled, and the use of abbreviations like ""@NUM1"" and ""@CAPS1"" is unnecessary and confusing. The student also fails to use proper punctuation, resulting in run-on sentences and unclear meaning.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. The student attempts to describe a situation where they were patient, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks a clear purpose. The student jumps between different ideas and fails to provide a clear conclusion.

The student's use of vocabulary is also limited, with words like ""so"" and ""ok"" being overused. The student could have used more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the situation.

However, the student does attempt to describe a situation where they were patient, which is a good start. The student also shows some understanding of the concept of patience, stating that it means being ""understanding and tolerant"" (although this is not explicitly stated in the essay).

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and concise argument against excessive censorship. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their stance, making the essay relatable and engaging. Here are some specific strengths and weaknesses of the essay:

Strengths:

1.  The writer starts with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the essay and grabs the reader's attention.
2.  The writer effectively uses personal experiences, such as being a high school student and having to deal with censorship, to illustrate their point.
3.  The writer provides a clear and concise thesis statement, stating that censorship should be limited to prevent the removal of books and music from libraries.
4.  The writer uses rhetorical devices, such as hyperbole (""big woop"") and alliteration (""lighthearted people""), to make the essay more engaging and memorable.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer's writing style is informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay in a newspaper.
2.  The writer could have provided more evidence to support their arguments, such as statistics or expert opinions.
3.  The writer's transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking words and phrases.
4.  The writer could have addressed potential counterarguments more effectively, such as the potential impact of explicit content on young readers.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. The student has identified some potential obstacles related to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building, including the building's structure, the flammability of helium and hydrogen, and the turbulent airwaves at the top of the building. However, the student's analysis lacks depth and specificity, and their writing is marred by grammatical errors and simplistic sentence structures.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear connections between the student's ideas. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the building's structure to the flammability of the gases, without providing a clear explanation of how these factors relate to each other. Additionally, the student's writing is often vague and lacks concrete evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. For example, the student states that the airwaves at the top of the building are ""extremely violent,"" but does not provide any specific information from the excerpt to back up this claim.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of articles. For instance, the sentence ""There seemed to be many problems erupting during the making of the dirigibles dock"" is unclear and should be rephrased to improve its coherence. The student also uses simplistic sentence structures, such as the repetitive use of short, declarative sentences.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed analysis of the excerpt, using clear and concise language, and addressing the prompt more directly. They should also work on correcting grammatical errors and varying their sentence structures to create a more engaging and polished essay.

The essay effectively addresses the prompt by sharing a personal anecdote about the importance of laughter in a relationship, specifically in a sports team setting. The writer's use of a true story from their volleyball experience makes the essay engaging and relatable. The writer's voice is evident throughout the essay, and their passion for the topic is palpable.

Strengths:

1.  The writer starts with a broad statement about the benefits of laughter, which is a good way to introduce the topic. However, the essay gains momentum when the writer shares their personal experience, making it more engaging and authentic.
2.  The writer provides specific details about their volleyball experience, including the challenges they faced and how they overcame them. This shows that the writer can effectively use descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind.
3.  The writer's use of dialogue adds a conversational tone to the essay, making it feel more like a personal story rather than a dry, informative piece.
4.  The writer effectively uses transitions to connect their ideas and paragraphs, making the essay flow smoothly.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer could have provided more context about the volleyball season, such as the team's overall performance and the significance of the state playoffs.
2.  Some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which can make the essay harder to read. For example, ""We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" could be rephrased for clarity.
3.  The writer could have provided more analysis or reflection on the role of laughter in their team's success. While they mention that laughter helped them win, they could have explored this idea further.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Provide more context about the volleyball season and the significance of the state playoffs.
2.  Edit the essay for grammar and sentence structure to make it easier to read.
3.  Analyze the role of laughter in the team's success and provide more insight into how it affected their performance.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the author's intention in concluding the story with the given paragraph. They correctly identify that the author is indicating that the protagonist will take the test again in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding. However, the student's explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They do not fully consider the symbolic significance of the hibiscus plant in the story and its connection to the protagonist's determination and growth.

The student also makes an assumption that the protagonist bought the plant after failing the test, which is not explicitly stated in the text. This assumption may be based on the context, but it would be more accurate to say that the student should have provided evidence from the story to support this claim.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The sentences are short and lack transitions, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

The essay provides a clear and coherent argument about the importance of laughter in relationships. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their claim, making the essay engaging and relatable. The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect their ideas and create a smooth flow of thought.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to provide specific examples from the writer's personal life, such as watching a video with their family and enjoying the laughter together. This helps to illustrate the point that laughter can bring people together and strengthen relationships. The writer also effectively uses quotes and references to support their argument, such as the phrase ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and Norman {CAPS4}'s book ""Laughter is the best medicine.""

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the writer could benefit from more explicit connections between their ideas.

The writer also uses some clichéd phrases, such as ""Laughter is contagious"" and ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" which could be replaced with more original language. Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some effective examples to support the writer's argument. However, with some revisions to sentence structure, transitions, and originality, the essay could be even stronger.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, advocating for the preservation of books that may be considered offensive by some individuals. The essay begins with a personal perspective, stating that the student does not get offended by most content, which sets the tone for their argument. However, this initial statement could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or explanations to support their claim.

The student's main argument is that libraries should not remove books that do not cause significant problems for the majority of people. They suggest that librarians would not intentionally display books that offend the public and that the books are available for reading and knowledge growth. This argument is well-supported by the student's personal experience of visiting the public library multiple times without encountering any offending content.

The student also highlights the importance of books in promoting knowledge and growth, which is a crucial point in the debate on censorship. They argue that removing books would hinder the nation's progress and overall well-being. This argument is well-structured and effectively conveys the student's perspective.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student could have provided more concrete examples or evidence to support their claims, such as specific books or incidents that they have encountered. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced language and sentence structure, as some of the sentences are simple and lack variety.

Furthermore, the student could have addressed potential counterarguments more effectively. For instance, they could have acknowledged the concerns of those who might be offended by certain content and provided a more detailed explanation of why they believe the benefits of preserving such books outweigh the potential drawbacks.

The essay is a creative attempt to share a personal experience where laughter played a significant role. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a picture of a fun-filled birthday party. However, there are areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay.

Strengths:
- The writer has a clear and engaging narrative voice, making the reader feel like they are part of the story.
- The use of descriptive language, such as ""chilled and hung out for a while,"" effectively conveys the relaxed atmosphere of the party.
- The writer includes specific details about the activities they did, such as playing games, having an icing fight, and watching a movie, which helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

Weaknesses:
- The essay lacks a clear introduction that sets the scene and provides context for the story. A more engaging opening would draw the reader in and make them want to continue reading.
- The writer jumps abruptly from one activity to another without providing a smooth transition. For example, the sentence ""Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while"" feels disconnected from the previous sentence.
- The writer could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the setting and characters. For example, what did the living room look like? What kind of games did they play at the park?
- The writer could also benefit from more varied sentence structure. Many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity, which makes the writing feel a bit flat.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Start with a more engaging introduction that sets the scene and provides context for the story.
- Use transitional phrases or words to connect the different activities and create a smoother flow.
- Add more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the setting and characters.
- Vary sentence structure by using compound or complex sentences to create more interest and depth.

The student has attempted to analyze the conclusion of the story, but their response falls short in providing a clear and well-supported explanation. The student's reasoning is somewhat disconnected from the actual events and themes presented in the story. 

The student states that Saeng decides to retake the driver's test in the spring because of the moderate weather, which reminds her of home. However, this interpretation is not supported by the provided text. The story does not mention Saeng taking a driver's test, nor does it explicitly state that the spring weather reminds her of home. In fact, the story's final paragraph suggests that Saeng is motivated by a more personal and introspective reason.

The student also makes a comparison between Saeng and themselves, stating that they buy objects that remind them of their old home. While this is a relatable sentiment, it is not directly related to the story's conclusion and seems to be a personal aside. Furthermore, the student's statement that Saeng's commitment to her old home makes them feel less different when they miss their old home is not supported by the story and appears to be a projection of the student's own feelings onto the character.

To improve this response, the student should focus on analyzing the actual events and themes presented in the story, rather than making assumptions or drawing personal connections. They should also strive to provide more specific and detailed evidence from the text to support their claims.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the need to modify the building's frames to strengthen them and the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable. However, the essay could be improved by providing more details and explanations to support the claims made.

One of the strengths of the essay is that it addresses multiple obstacles faced by the builders, including the structural integrity of the building, the flammability of hydrogen, the impact of wind on the dirigible's mooring, and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The student has also demonstrated the ability to identify and explain the consequences of these obstacles, such as the potential destruction of a population in New York.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed explanations of the obstacles. For example, the student mentions that the winds constantly shifted and the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast, but does not provide any further explanation of how this affected the safety of pedestrians below. Additionally, the student could have provided more information about the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, such as who enacted the law and when.

Furthermore, the essay could be improved by providing more transitional phrases and sentences to connect the ideas between paragraphs. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the structural integrity of the building to the flammability of hydrogen, and then to the impact of wind and the law.

The writer mentions that the author listens to music, cooks food, and enjoys time with family, but these points are not developed or connected to the overall mood of the memoir. The phrase ""house warming"" seems to be a typo and might be intended to convey a sense of warmth and coziness, but it is not clear how this relates to the author's mood.

1. The essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. The writer relies heavily on simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the essay seem a bit flat.
2. Some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on"" could be rephrased to ""Computers are helpful for various tasks, such as projects, email, and planning vacations.""
3. The writer could have provided more nuanced arguments to address the opposing viewpoint. While they acknowledge that some people think computers are a negative influence, they do not fully address this concern or offer a more balanced perspective.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Encourage the writer to use more descriptive language and varied sentence structures to make the essay more engaging.
2. Suggest that the writer condense some of the sentences to improve clarity and flow.
3. Encourage the writer to provide more balanced arguments by addressing the opposing viewpoint and offering a more nuanced perspective.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and specific details from the excerpt. The student mentions the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, but their explanation is vague and does not accurately reflect the content of the excerpt.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific information from the excerpt. The student mentions that the builders were trying to make the Empire State Building perfect for the designers, but this is not supported by the excerpt. The student also states that the dirigibles were near the mooring mast, but this is not a direct quote or a specific detail from the excerpt.

The student's writing also lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps between different ideas and sentences, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For example, the student mentions that the dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers, but this seems unrelated to the main topic of the obstacles faced by the builders.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors and lack of proper punctuation. The student uses phrases such as ""they went through alot of work, effort, and time"" and ""their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay,"" which are not grammatically correct.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The writer provides specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, which is a strength of the essay. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and describe the obstacles faced by the builders. They mention the lack of a suitable landing area, the difficulty of constructing the mooring mast, the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and the impact of violent air currents on the dirigibles. These are all relevant points that are supported by specific information from the excerpt.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas and obstacles without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow at times. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better clarity.

The writer also struggles with using proper grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of comma splices, run-on sentences, and missing articles. For example, ""Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". This sentence is a comma splice and could be rewritten for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more analysis and depth in their writing. While they identify the obstacles, they do not provide much analysis or explanation of why these obstacles were significant or how they impacted the builders' plans. For example, they mention that the builders realized the mast's purpose became obsolete, but they do not explain why this was the case or what this meant for the project.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and subsequent paragraphs that elaborate on the safety concerns and practical issues.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, the mention of the 1937 incident involving the {PERSON} dirigible Hindenburg in {LOCATION} New Jersey is a good example of the dangers of hydrogen-filled dirigibles. However, the student could have provided more context about the incident and its relevance to the Empire State Building.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the natural hazards posed by air currents on the top of the building, which would make it difficult to control the swaying of the blimp. The suggestion to use weights to hold the blimp down is a practical solution, but the student could have elaborated on the potential risks associated with this approach.

The student's writing is clear and concise, with proper grammar and spelling. However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. For example, the sentence ""The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical"" could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that books should not be removed from shelves. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear thesis statement. The student provides several convincing arguments to support their position, including the idea that censorship can lead to a lack of access to information, the futility of trying to restrict access to certain materials, and the importance of books for personal growth and development.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of rhetorical questions, which effectively engage the reader and encourage them to think critically about the issue. For example, the question ""So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't?"" is a powerful argument against censorship. The student also uses vivid language, such as ""If you truely think about it, then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it,"" which adds to the essay's persuasive power.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack depth, which can make the essay feel a bit flat at times. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, they could have discussed a particular book that was banned and the impact it had on the community.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay. For example, ""anwser"" should be spelled ""answer,"" and ""racie"" should be spelled ""racy.""

The essay attempts to address the prompt but falls short in providing a clear and detailed explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer starts by stating that the features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly, but fails to provide specific examples or supporting details to back up this claim. The only sentence that attempts to elaborate on this point is ""When she biked around a bend,'my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.'"" However, this sentence is unclear and lacks context. It is not evident how the setting, specifically the bend, affects the cyclist's troubles, thirsts, and fear. The use of quotation marks around ""my troubles, thirsts, and fear"" also seems out of place and may be a formatting error.

Furthermore, the writer could have explored other features of the setting, such as the terrain, weather, or time of day, to demonstrate how they impact the cyclist. The essay lacks depth and specificity, making it difficult to fully understand the writer's point.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, as mentioned in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by {ORGANIZATION2}. The student has identified two main obstacles: safety and availability. 

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt to support their answer. For instance, they mention that the explosive tendencies of hydrogen and unmanageable winds create an unsafe environment, but they do not provide a direct quote or reference from the excerpt to back up this claim. This lack of evidence makes the statement seem more like an inference rather than a fact supported by the text.

Additionally, the student's use of language and grammar is not always precise. For example, the sentence ""With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all"" contains a spelling error (""continuesly"" should be ""continuously"") and a grammatical error (the use of ""continuesly"" is incorrect in this context). 

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles. For instance, they mention that the unavailability of the route made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible, but they do not explain why this was a significant issue or how it affected the builders' plans.

The writer effectively uses quotes from the text to support their conclusion, demonstrating a good understanding of the relationship between the setting and the cyclist's experience. However, the essay could benefit from more in-depth analysis and organization.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify specific features of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the change from ""flat road"" to ""short, rolling hills"" and the extreme heat. The writer provides quotes from the text to support these points, which shows that they have carefully read and understood the material. For example, the writer states, ""The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate through the 'hills' as opposed to the 'Flat roads,' making him more quickly tired."" This sentence effectively uses the quote from the text to explain how the change in terrain affects the cyclist.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis and explanation of the writer's points. For instance, the writer states that the heat affected the cyclist, but they could elaborate on how the heat specifically impacted the cyclist's experience. Additionally, the essay could benefit from a clearer organization and introduction. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the change in terrain to the heat, and the essay could benefit from a more logical flow of ideas.

Furthermore, the writer could improve their writing by using more precise language and avoiding simplistic statements. For example, the writer states, ""Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist."" While this statement is true, it is not particularly insightful or original.

They have identified three moods - willing, grateful, and hopeful - and provided quotes to support their claims. However, the analysis could benefit from more specific and detailed explanations of how the quotes create these moods.

The student's use of quotes is a good starting point, but they could have analyzed the quotes more thoroughly. For example, when discussing the first quote, they could have explained how the phrase ""struggle would lead them and their children to better times"" creates a sense of optimism and hope for the future. Similarly, when discussing the second quote, they could have explored how the image of a ""door open"" conveys a sense of hospitality and generosity.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more context about the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" and its author. This would have helped to situate their analysis within the broader narrative and provided a clearer understanding of the author's intentions.

The essay is a personal narrative that effectively tells a true story about an incident where laughter played a significant role. The writer's use of descriptive language and vivid details helps the reader visualize the scene and feel the excitement and tension of the experience. The writer's voice is engaging, and the use of colloquial expressions, such as ""great old time"" and ""super cool,"" adds to the informal tone of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's emotions and thoughts during the incident. The writer's use of phrases like ""I panicked and froze to the bar"" and ""I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember"" effectively convey the writer's fear, panic, and confusion. The writer also does a good job of showing the reader the consequences of the incident, such as the pain and discomfort the writer experienced after the accident.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. One of the main issues is the lack of clear transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the setup of the photo shoot to the accident, and then to the aftermath. Adding transitional phrases or sentences to connect the ideas would make the essay flow better.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more descriptive language when describing the accident itself. While the writer does a good job of conveying the physical sensations of the impact, the description of the accident feels a bit rushed and could be expanded upon.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing commas. While these errors do not detract from the overall meaning of the essay, they do make it harder to read and understand.

The writing is marred by numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. The student's argument is also not well-supported, and they fail to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The student's opinion is stated in the first sentence, but it is not developed throughout the essay. The student jumps between different ideas, such as the negative effects of excessive computer use, the benefits of physical activity, and the risks of online shopping. This lack of focus makes it difficult to follow the student's argument.

However, there are areas that need improvement. The writer could have provided a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the story to the prompt. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the day's events to the incident with the phone. A smoother transition would enhance the narrative flow.

For example, the sentence ""We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now"" could be rephrased for better clarity and interest.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear opinion on the effects of computers on people. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the writer's argument. For instance, the writer mentions the quote from the chief orthopedic surgeon, which adds credibility to their point about the benefits of typing on computers. Additionally, the writer shares a personal experience of using the internet to explore a faraway place, which makes the essay more engaging and relatable.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer needs to work on grammar and punctuation errors. For example, ""do reasearch"" should be ""do research,"" and ""pleasurable online networking"" is a bit awkwardly phrased. Additionally, the writer uses the phrase ""seldom do we realize"" which is a bit wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their argument. While they mention the benefits of computers, they could have also discussed the potential drawbacks, such as the risk of addiction or the impact on mental health. This would have made their argument more balanced and convincing.

Finally, the writer could have used more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, instead of using the phrase ""crucial tools,"" they could have used a more descriptive word like ""essential"" or ""indispensable.""

The student has attempted to identify the mood created by the author in the memoir, but their analysis is limited and lacks depth. They have provided a general statement about the parents' actions, but failed to support it with specific details from the memoir. The student's reasoning is also somewhat simplistic, relying on a surface-level interpretation of the parents' decision to leave their old life behind. To strengthen their analysis, the student could have explored the author's use of language, imagery, and tone to create a more nuanced understanding of the mood.

The student's use of the phrase ""pretty much"" is also informal and detracts from the overall clarity of their writing.

The essay provided demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt, but it lacks clarity, coherence, and effective organization. The writer attempts to present their opinion on the effects of computers on people but fails to provide a clear and well-supported argument. The essay consists of fragmented sentences and lacks transitional phrases to connect ideas.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify some benefits of computers, such as being able to talk to friends and family online. However, the writer also mentions that people spend too much time on computers, which is a valid concern. Unfortunately, the writer does not develop this idea further or provide evidence to support it.

The writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and the sentences are often short and simplistic. For example, the sentence ""People needs computers to look for a job"" could be rephrased to ""Computers are essential for people to search for jobs."" Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples to support their claims.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear and well-supported argument, using transitional phrases to connect ideas, and varying sentence structure to create a more engaging and polished piece of writing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. They have identified three main challenges: safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law. The student has also provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, such as the risk of fire, the difficulty of keeping the blimps stabilized, and the impact of wind on the dirigible's stability.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The transitions between paragraphs and ideas are not always smooth, and some sentences are worded awkwardly. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them.

The student's use of quotes from the excerpt is a strength, as it shows that they are engaging with the text and providing evidence to support their claims. However, the quotes are not always properly integrated into the text, and the student could have explained the significance of the quotes more clearly.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear thesis statement and instead jumps directly into examples without a clear connection to the prompt. The writer also struggles to provide a logical flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow the essay's argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the attempt to address both physical and mental effects of the setting on the cyclist. The writer mentions that the setting affects the cyclist ""both physically and mentally,"" which is a good start. However, the physical effect is not clearly explained, and the mental effect is only briefly touched upon.

The writer provides an example from the story, ""when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy 'pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth',"" which is a good attempt to support the argument. However, the writer fails to explain how this example specifically relates to the mental effect of the setting on the cyclist. The writer also mentions that the cyclist ""hang his head as he rode on"" and thinks he will ""die out of here,"" but these statements are not clearly connected to the setting.

To improve the essay, the writer should provide a clear thesis statement, a logical flow of ideas, and more specific examples that clearly support the argument. The writer should also explain how the setting affects the cyclist in both physical and mental ways.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but lacks specific and detailed analysis. The writer relies heavily on general statements and fails to provide concrete evidence from the text to support their claims. For instance, the statement ""He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up"" is not supported by any specific information from the memoir. This lack of textual evidence makes the analysis superficial and weak.

Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""the feel of his home reflected on the mood"" is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of how the home environment contributes to the mood. The quote from paragraph @NUM1 is correctly identified, but it is not analyzed or explained in detail. The writer simply states that the author ""can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood,"" without providing any specific reasons or examples from the text to support this claim.

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect a cyclist. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanation. The student has identified three features of the setting (heat, hills, and ghost towns) and briefly described their impact on the cyclist. However, the explanations are not well-supported with specific details and examples from the essay.

For instance, when discussing the heat, the student mentions that it ""dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke."" While this is a valid point, it would be more effective if the student provided a specific example from the essay to support this claim. Similarly, when discussing the hills, the student states that they ""can take massive amounts of energy to climb,"" but fails to provide a concrete example from the essay to illustrate this point.

The student also struggles to provide a clear and logical connection between the features of the setting and their impact on the cyclist.

The essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has attempted to identify the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the analysis is limited and lacks depth. 

One of the main issues is the lack of clear and concise writing. The student has used simple sentences, but they often lack proper grammar and spelling. For instance, the word ""obstacals"" should be spelled as ""obstacles."" Additionally, the student has used informal language, such as ""over come"" instead of ""overcome."" 

Furthermore, the student has not fully understood the concept of obstacles and has used the term loosely. The student has listed several challenges, but has not provided a clear explanation of how these challenges affected the builders. For example, the student mentions that the top of the building would have cost a significant amount for modifications, but does not explain how this would have impacted the docking of dirigibles.

The student has also failed to provide a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the entire essay together. The essay jumps between different obstacles without a clear direction or conclusion.

The student has, however, demonstrated some understanding of the content by referencing specific information from the excerpt. For instance, the student mentions the law against low-flying airships and the use of hydrogen in dirigibles.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by expressing their opinion on censorship in libraries. However, their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of supporting evidence. Here are some specific areas of improvement:

1. **Organization and coherence**: The essay jumps between ideas without a clear structure. The student starts by stating their opinion, but then introduces a contradictory idea about restricting access to certain materials for adults. A clearer introduction and body paragraphs would help to organize the student's thoughts and make the essay more cohesive.

2. **Grammar and mechanics**: The essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues (""my personal opinion is that they should not be removed... unless they are so inapropreate""), incorrect verb tenses (""my opinion goes half and half""), and missing articles (""the movievs and librarys""). The student should proofread their work more carefully to eliminate these errors.

3. **Supporting evidence**: While the student attempts to use personal experience and observations, their examples are vague and lack specific details. For instance, they mention that ""many others @MONTH1 have different opinions on this subject,"" but do not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support their claim.

4. **Use of quotes**: The student quotes Katherine Paterson's statement, but fails to effectively incorporate it into their argument. They could have used the quote to support their position or respond to potential counterarguments.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect a cyclist's performance. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and organization. The student jumps abruptly between ideas and fails to provide a clear thesis statement. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies in sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from the setting to support their argument. For instance, when discussing the hot and dry conditions of the high deserts of California, the student effectively uses the phrase ""high deserts of California in June"" to create a vivid image in the reader's mind. This is a good example of how the setting can affect the cyclist's performance, as the heat and dryness can lead to discomfort and fatigue.

However, the student could have taken this idea further by providing more details about how the cyclist's performance was affected by the setting. For example, they could have discussed how the heat and dryness impacted the cyclist's speed, endurance, or overall experience.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar and sentence structure. In the sentence ""Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert,"" the student uses a double negative, which can make the sentence confusing. Additionally, the sentence ""that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced"" contains a spelling error and a lack of clarity.

The essay effectively tells a true story about the importance of laughter in a relationship, as requested by the prompt. The writer shares a personal anecdote about a sleepover with their best friend, highlighting the moments of laughter and fun they experienced together. The essay is engaging and easy to follow, with a clear structure that takes the reader through the events of the sleepover.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of vivid and descriptive language, which helps to bring the reader into the scene. For example, the writer's description of the ""family-sized bag of {CAPS5} and six pack of {ORGANIZATION1}"" consumed before the sleepover effectively conveys the excitement and energy of the situation. The writer also uses sensory details, such as the stinging sensation of the nail polish and the feeling of ice cubes going down the wrong pipe, to create a sense of immersion.

The essay also does a good job of exploring the theme of laughter and its importance in relationships. The writer argues that laughter can bring people together and help to relieve stress, both physically and emotionally. This is supported by the example of the dentist's use of laughing gas, which is a clever connection to make.

However, there are some areas for improvement. At times, the writing can be a bit disjointed, with sentences that feel like they could be connected more smoothly. For example, the transition from the sleepover to the discussion of the importance of laughter feels a bit abrupt. Additionally, some of the sentences could be tightened up for clarity and concision.

The writer also uses some informal language and slang, which may not be suitable for all audiences. For example, the use of ""boy did it hurt"" and ""it hurts"" could be replaced with more formal language.

The writer's use of capitalization is inconsistent, and the text appears to be a jumbled collection of phrases and sentences. The narrative is disjointed, making it challenging to follow the events described. The writer's tone is also inconsistent, veering between frustration and calmness.

The writer attempts to illustrate patience by describing a situation where they are waiting in a drive-thru line. However, the story is marred by the writer's own impatience, which undermines the intended message. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I mumerred 'but I m starving'"" and ""I well still mad that @CAPS8 sat there all that time"" reveals their own frustration and lack of patience.

The writer's use of language is also simplistic and lacks descriptive details. The text is heavy on dialogue, which, while attempting to convey the writer's emotions, comes across as forced and unnatural. The writer's attempt to illustrate patience is further hindered by their own impatience, making it difficult to take the story seriously.

The writer's understanding of patience is also limited, as they seem to equate patience with waiting quietly, rather than understanding and tolerance.

In terms of content, the student could have provided more nuanced and balanced arguments. While they acknowledge the potential benefits of computers, they do not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the student's use of hyperbole, such as ""throw away your life,"" may be seen as exaggerated and detract from the credibility of the argument.

The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and attempts to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, there are several areas that require improvement in terms of grammar, spelling, and coherence. 

One of the primary issues is the inconsistent use of vocabulary, as seen in the words ""obsticles"" and ""spanding."" These words should be spelled as ""obstacles"" and ""spreading,"" respectively. Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, which makes the essay feel somewhat flat. For instance, the sentence ""All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic"" could be rephrased for more impact.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed analysis of the excerpt provided. While the student mentions the violent air currents on top of the building, they do not fully explain how this obstacle affected the builders' plans. A more in-depth examination of the excerpt would strengthen the essay's argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from the text to support their conclusion. For instance, when discussing the cyclist's feelings of loneliness, the student quotes, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind."" This effectively illustrates how the setting's lack of features can lead to feelings of isolation. Additionally, the student's use of the phrase ""ironic twist"" to describe the abandoned building is a good attempt to analyze the text and show a deeper understanding of the narrative.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. Firstly, the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the student jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's loss of hope to the discovery of the Grape and @CAPS1'S FISH CAMP. A more cohesive connection between these ideas would make the essay flow better. Secondly, the student could benefit from providing more analysis and explanation of the setting's features and how they affect the cyclist's emotions. For example, the student could discuss how the abandoned building's state and the sight of the Grape and @CAPS1'S FISH CAMP sign contribute to the cyclist's emotions.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be more polished with the use of more descriptive language and varied sentence structures. For instance, instead of stating ""The setting's features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings,"" the student could rephrase it to ""The setting's features have a profound impact on the cyclist's emotions, leaving them feeling isolated, hopeful, and ultimately, relieved.""

The essay also explores the idea that laughter can be a coping mechanism in difficult situations. The writer's friend's deployment was a challenging experience, but the writer and their friend were able to use laughter to distract themselves from the reality of the situation. This is a valuable lesson that can be applied to many real-life situations.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity, which can make the writing feel a bit flat. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the transition from the story about the friend's deployment to the conclusion feels a bit abrupt.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing commas. While these errors do not detract from the overall message of the essay, they do make it harder to read and understand.

Finally, the essay could benefit from more analysis and reflection. While the writer does a good job of sharing their personal story, they could take it a step further by analyzing the significance of laughter in their relationship and how it has impacted their life.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their writing requires improvement in several areas. The essay starts with a clear statement of the topic, but the introduction could be more engaging and effective. The student's opinion is well-expressed, but it would benefit from more supporting evidence and logical connections between ideas.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, such as spending too much time on computers and neglecting physical activity and social interactions. However, the student could have provided more specific examples and details to support their claims. For instance, they mention exercising as a better alternative to computer use, but they could have explained how regular exercise benefits physical and mental health.

The student's writing also suffers from some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and informal language (e.g., ""I know people that stay on the computer all day,"" ""I say that to say this,"" ""you could even take a nap for a little while or something""). These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the paragraph about the importance of family and friends feels disconnected from the rest of the essay. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to link these ideas more effectively.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the student's opinion. The student's final sentence, ""So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if your really into computers, try to balance your time out,"" feels somewhat abrupt and could be rephrased for greater impact.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay fails to effectively explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The student mentions that the cyclist gets tired easily, but does not provide a clear connection between the desert setting and the cyclist's fatigue. The statement ""there are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn’t get water"" is a good start, but it is not fully developed. The student also mentions the heat causing the cyclist to sweat, which affects his vision, but this point is not fully explored.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""that"" instead of ""the"" in the phrase ""the that desert."" Additionally, the sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making the essay feel flat and unengaging.

The student does attempt to provide some examples from the essay to support their conclusion, but these examples are not fully developed and do not provide a clear understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, such as the use of hydrogen in most foreign dirigibles and the destruction of the Hindenburg. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the safety concerns related to hydrogen and the potential consequences of a disaster like the Hindenburg accident. The student also correctly identifies the issue with the wind on top of the building and the existing law against airships flying too low over populated areas. However, the student could have provided more detail and analysis of these points.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some areas where the language could be more precise. For example, the sentence ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas"" is unclear. The student likely meant to say ""over your city's ring areas"" or ""over the city's ring roads."" Additionally, the sentence ""the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" seems out of place and could be removed for clarity.

To improve the essay, the student could provide more specific examples and details to support their points. They could also work on refining their language and sentence structure to make the writing more concise and clear.

The essay is a heartwarming and engaging narrative that effectively conveys the importance of laughter and relationships. The writer has done an excellent job of creating a vivid and immersive experience for the reader by incorporating sensory details and descriptive language. The use of specific anecdotes and personal experiences makes the story relatable and authentic.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to balance the emotional and lighthearted moments with the more serious and poignant ones. The writer skillfully weaves together the narrative, creating a cohesive and engaging story that keeps the reader invested in the characters and their experiences.

The writer's use of descriptive language is also noteworthy, particularly in the way they describe the setting and the emotions of the characters. For example, the phrase ""The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it"" effectively conveys the joy and happiness that the writer experienced during their time with the family.

However, there are some areas for improvement. At times, the writing can feel a bit simplistic and lacks depth, particularly in the transitions between paragraphs. Additionally, some of the sentences could be tightened up for better clarity and concision.

Furthermore, while the writer does a good job of incorporating sensory details, there are moments where the writing feels a bit too focused on the writer's own experiences and emotions, rather than the experiences of the family they are writing about. This can make it feel a bit self-centered at times.

Overall, the essay is a strong effort that effectively conveys the importance of laughter and relationships. With some refinement and attention to detail, it has the potential to be even stronger.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have more benefits than drawbacks. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples to support their claims, such as the ability to access sources online, interact with friends, and the potential for future advancements.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writing is informal, with several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. The student also relies heavily on personal anecdotes, which, while engaging, may not be convincing to all readers. Additionally, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be strengthened with a more nuanced summary of the main points.

The student's use of transitional phrases and sentences is limited, which makes the essay feel a bit disjointed at times. Furthermore, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For instance, the sentence ""Then you will try to stop them with 'computers eat your brain'. We all know that is garbage."" could be rephrased for greater impact.

Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively uses evidence to support their claims. With further refinement, this essay could be even more effective in persuading readers to agree with the student's opinion.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify three valid reasons for their opinion: exercising, spending time with family, and being active. However, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

One of the main issues with the essay is the student's writing mechanics. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""spending to much time on a computer is bad"" (should be ""spending too much time on a computer is bad""), ""Exercising"" (should be capitalized as a proper noun), and ""their fun go out with"" (should be ""they're fun to go out with""). Additionally, the student's sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, making the essay feel monotonous.

Another issue with the essay is the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas. The student jumps abruptly from discussing exercising to spending time with family, and then to being active. To improve the essay, the student should use transitional phrases or words to connect their ideas and make the essay flow more smoothly.

The student also struggles with using proper vocabulary and sentence-level grammar. For example, ""socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people"" (should be ""socializing with people on a computer is not as good as socializing with people"") and ""it keeps you and healthy"" (should be ""it keeps you healthy""). The student should strive to use more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively.

Finally, the student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of their main points. To improve the essay, the student should rephrase their conclusion to reiterate their main points and leave the reader with a lasting impression.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against removing materials from shelves due to offense. The writer effectively uses personal experience and observations to support their argument. However, the essay requires improvement in several areas to enhance its overall quality.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by highlighting the importance of reading, which is a crucial aspect of their argument. This sets the tone for the rest of the essay and establishes the significance of the topic.
2.  The writer effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize their point. For instance, ""Why would they take anything off the shelf?"" and ""Who knows how many books we would have left?"" These questions encourage the reader to think critically about the issue.
3.  The student attempts to provide a counterargument by acknowledging that people can be easily offended. This shows an understanding of the complexity of the issue and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. The writer's position on censorship is not explicitly stated in the introduction, making it difficult for the reader to understand the main argument.
2.  The writing is marred by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and poor sentence structure. For example, ""If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful"" and ""people deffinatly need to know how to read."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.
3.  The writer relies heavily on simplistic and repetitive arguments, such as ""Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting"" and ""Many people get offended in this word way to easy."" These statements lack depth and fail to provide convincing evidence to support the argument.
4.  The conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The writer simply restates their position without providing a clear call to action or final thought.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the introduction to include a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  Edit the essay for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and poor sentence structure.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and use of transitional phrases. 

The student starts by mentioning the lack of landing area in the organization, which is a valid point. However, the transition to the next idea about the height of the mast is abrupt and could be connected with a transitional phrase. The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how the height of the mast would be a problem for both passengers and those on the ground level. 

The student then mentions the weight of the dirigible and the potential stress it would put on the building's frame, which is a good point. However, the sentence structure is a bit awkward, and the use of the phrase ""the Idea proved to be unsafe"" is unclear. The student seems to be referring to the German dirigible incident, but the connection is not explicitly stated.

The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how the German dirigible incident led to the realization of the danger of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.

However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks specific textual evidence to support the claims. The student relies heavily on general statements and does not provide a clear explanation of how the author's words and descriptions contribute to the mood.

Similarly, when discussing the happiness mood, the student mentions that the author makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family, but does not provide a clear explanation of what specific words or descriptions create this happiness.

Furthermore, the student's use of language is sometimes unclear, with phrases such as ""which is the main mood of the memoir"" and ""are two moods created by Rodriguez in his memoir."" Additionally, the student's use of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 is confusing, as it is unclear what these symbols refer to.

The essay is a well-structured narrative that effectively conveys the importance of laughter in relationships. The writer has done a commendable job in creating a vivid and engaging story that showcases the joy and laughter shared among friends on a fun-filled day. The use of descriptive language and sensory details, such as ""crazy things we love,"" ""skulls all over,"" and ""towers of rocks all over the place,"" helps the reader visualize the scene and become immersed in the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to effectively use transitions and connections between paragraphs. The writer has done a good job in linking ideas and events, making the narrative flow smoothly. For instance, the transition from the description of the store to the creation of the teddy bear is seamless, and the use of the phrase ""Next, we went to"" effectively connects the two ideas.

However, there are areas that need improvement. The writer could have benefited from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity, which makes the writing seem a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary"" could be rephrased to make it more engaging and interesting.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more depth and analysis in the conclusion. While the writer mentions the importance of laughter, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points. A more effective conclusion would have tied together the events of the story and reinforced the thesis statement.

Furthermore, there are some minor errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. For instance, the sentence ""We all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and grammar.

They have not effectively connected the final paragraph of the story to the rest of the narrative, and their analysis is superficial. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors and a lack of supporting evidence from the story.

The student states that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to let the reader know when the protagonist, Saeng, will take the test again. However, this is not entirely accurate. The paragraph actually serves as a reflection of Saeng's determination and her connection to nature. The mention of the hibiscus budding and the geese returning in the spring suggests that Saeng is looking forward to a new beginning, not just taking the test again. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Saeng had taken a long walk home and stopped at the flower shop, indicating that she is trying to find solace and comfort in nature.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of Saeng's emotions is incomplete. They mention that Saeng is probably embarrassed about wanting to wait so long to take the test again, but they do not consider the context of the story. Saeng's decision to wait until the spring is not about being embarrassed, but rather about finding a new perspective and a fresh start. This is evident in the way the author describes the changing of the seasons as a time of renewal.

The student's writing also suffers from a lack of supporting evidence from the story. They mention that Saeng's mother was upset at first, then realized her daughter wasn't happy and changed her mood, but this is not relevant to the final paragraph of the story.

1. **Content**: The essay attempts to provide two personal anecdotes about times when the writer had to be patient. However, the examples are somewhat vague and lack specific details, making it challenging to fully understand the situations. For instance, the writer mentions waiting to get out of school on a holiday but doesn't elaborate on what made the experience particularly difficult or how they managed to be patient.

2. **Organization**: The essay jumps between different ideas without a clear logical flow. The writer starts by mentioning multiple instances of being patient, but then focuses on a single experience of waiting for the school bell to ring. The transition between the two anecdotes is abrupt, and the writer could have connected them more effectively.

These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

4. **Use of vocabulary**: The writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the situations. For example, instead of saying ""I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday,"" they could have described the feeling of excitement or frustration.

Firstly, the student uses the word ""promblems"" instead of ""problems,"" which is a grammatical error. This suggests that the student may need to review basic grammar rules. Additionally, the student uses the phrase ""most of there problem,"" which is a subject-verb agreement error. The correct phrase should be ""most of their problems.""

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more specific and detailed information from the excerpt.

The student also mentions that the air currents were ""extremely violant,"" but does not provide any context or explanation of what this means.

The student's conclusion that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building by the end of the construction is a good summary of the information, but it would be more effective if it were supported by more specific evidence from the excerpt.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the author's intention in concluding the story with the given paragraph. They correctly identify the theme of hope and determination in the final line, which suggests that the girl is motivated to retake the test when the natural world around her is renewed and rejuvenated. The student also provides specific examples from the text, such as the blooming of the hibiscus, to support their analysis.

However, the student's analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. For instance, they could have explored the significance of the geese returning and the snow melting, which are also symbols of renewal and new beginnings. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the emotional resonance of the girl's vow, explaining how it reveals her character and personality.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and sentence-level clarity. Some of the sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, which makes them difficult to follow.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing against removing books that may be considered offensive. The essay begins with a thought-provoking question that encourages the reader to consider the potential consequences of censorship. The student effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their argument, acknowledging that books can be alienating or uncomfortable to read.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to connect the topic to real-life scenarios, such as finding a book that makes fun of one's faith or appearance. The use of examples like these helps to illustrate the potential harm caused by censorship and the importance of freedom of speech. The student also raises a valid point about the diversity of human characteristics and the need to accept and appreciate individual differences.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writing could also be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from credible sources to support their argument, such as quotes from authors or experts on the topic.

The student's use of rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (e.g., ""alienated shelf"") and allusions (e.g., ""the world would be today""), adds depth and interest to the essay. However, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively conveys their opinion through personal anecdotes and observations. With further refinement and attention to detail, this essay could be even more effective in persuading the reader to consider the student's perspective.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has attempted to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are several areas where the student's analysis could be improved. 

Firstly, the student has identified three instances where the author creates the mood of appreciation, but the analysis of these instances could be more in-depth and nuanced. For example, when discussing the author's parents leaving Cuba, the student states that the parents ""did not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway."" This statement is not supported by the text and seems to be an assumption made by the student. A more accurate analysis would be to focus on the phrase ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" and explain how this phrase creates a sense of appreciation.

Secondly, the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the author's parents leaving Cuba to the author's statement about being grateful to his parents. A more cohesive essay would have a clearer structure and more effective transitions between ideas.

Thirdly, the student's use of quotes and analysis of the quotes could be more effective. The student quotes three instances from the memoir, but does not provide a clear explanation of how these quotes support the thesis statement. For example, when discussing the quote ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" the student states that this quote ""insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that 'he will never forget', what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone."" However, this analysis could be more specific and detailed. For example, the student could explain how the use of the word ""simple"" in the quote creates a sense of appreciation, or how the phrase ""turned this simple house into a home"" suggests a sense of transformation and gratitude.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, advocating for the removal of materials deemed offensive. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its arguments, relying heavily on simplistic and binary thinking. The student fails to consider the complexities of censorship, the importance of intellectual freedom, and the potential consequences of restricting access to information.

One of the primary issues with the essay is its lack of supporting evidence. The student relies on vague statements, such as ""most songs out are highly offensive"" and ""parents do not want their children to learn cuss words,"" without providing concrete examples or statistics to back up these claims. This lack of evidence undermines the credibility of the argument and makes it difficult to take the student's position seriously.

Furthermore, the student's suggestions for censorship, such as putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing, are impractical and unrealistic. This approach oversimplifies the issue and fails to address the underlying concerns about the content of the material.

The student also demonstrates a limited understanding of the purpose of libraries, stating that they are ""a place of learning or reading for entertainment."" While this is true, it oversimplifies the role of libraries as a hub for intellectual freedom and access to information. Libraries are meant to provide a safe and inclusive space for people to explore different perspectives and ideas, even if they may be challenging or uncomfortable.

The student's writing style is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks sophistication and refinement. The use of sentence structures is simple, and the vocabulary is limited. The essay could benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures, as well as a more nuanced and thoughtful tone.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal anecdote, but it is marred by several issues with grammar, spelling, and coherence. The writer's use of language is informal and often unclear, making it challenging to follow the narrative. The story is also somewhat violent and may not be suitable for a middle school audience.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is its attempt to illustrate patience through a relatable scenario. The writer describes a situation where they were in a dispute with a friend, but instead of escalating the situation, the friend chose to be patient and wait for an opportunity to retaliate. This shows a good understanding of the concept of patience.

However, the essay is weakened by several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. For example, ""Supper beast patience"" should be ""Supreme patience,"" and ""what felt live"" should be ""what felt like."" Additionally, the writer uses informal language and slang, such as ""blare,"" ""mong,"" and ""walles,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer's use of punctuation is inconsistent, and there are several instances of run-on sentences. For example, ""You wouldn’t ques what he said I took it out of ur walles.I yelled what I have ben holding that in there so I could go to the movies."" This sentence is unclear and could be rephrased for better coherence.

In terms of content, the essay could benefit from more detail and analysis.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the writer's claims. For instance, the mention of social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and the game @PERSON1, effectively illustrates the benefits of computers. The writer also attempts to address the counterargument about the negative effects of computers on physical activity, suggesting that it is a matter of personal choice.

However, the essay is marred by several issues. The language is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions like ""pathetic argument"" and ""just to recap."" The writer also relies heavily on capitalizing proper nouns, which can make the text appear awkward and unpolished. Furthermore, the essay lacks depth and nuance, with the writer failing to consider multiple perspectives on the issue.

The writer's tone is also somewhat confrontational, with the use of phrases like ""I disagree with the so-called 'experts.'"" This tone may alienate readers who hold differing opinions and undermine the writer's credibility.

Similarly, the writer mentions that there aren't many towns and that water is hard to find, but does not elaborate on how these conditions impact the cyclist's experience.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples to support the writer's claims. For example, when discussing the heat, the writer could have mentioned how it might cause dehydration or fatigue for the cyclist. When discussing the scarcity of towns, the writer could have talked about how it might make it difficult for the cyclist to find food, shelter, or medical help in case of an emergency.

One of the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the structural integrity of the building. The student correctly mentions that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame. This is a crucial point, as it highlights the potential risks of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building.

The student also uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which makes it difficult to understand their ideas. For instance, the sentence ""it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. Furthermore, the student fails to provide any specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion, which makes it hard to assess the validity of their argument.

To improve, the student should focus on providing clear and concise explanations, using specific examples to support their claims, and ensuring that their writing is free of grammatical errors.

The student has taken a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The essay begins by stating that high school students are already exposed to various forms of media and that shielding them from offensive content is not effective in the long run. The student provides a relatable example of a boss using profanity to express frustration, suggesting that exposure to such language can have a negative impact on individuals.

The student also attempts to support their argument by citing a hypothetical survey of teens and young adults, claiming that a significant percentage use vulgar language. However, this claim is not substantiated with evidence, and the student fails to provide a specific percentage or credible source to back up this assertion.

The essay's writing style is informal, with the use of colloquial expressions and abbreviations (e.g., ""Im,"" ""@CAPS1,"" ""@MONTH1""). While this may be characteristic of the student's voice, it detracts from the overall professionalism and clarity of the writing.

The student's argument is somewhat disjointed, with ideas presented in a somewhat haphazard manner. For instance, the transition between the discussion of the boss's behavior and the survey of teens and young adults feels abrupt. Additionally, the student fails to address potential counterarguments or provide a clear conclusion to the essay.

2.  The student has attempted to address both sides of the argument, mentioning the benefits of technology and the potential drawbacks.
3.  The student has used transitional phrases such as ""Such as"" and ""As you can see"" to connect ideas between sentences.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and direct thesis statement that explicitly states the student's opinion on the effects of computers on people.
2.  The student has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims, relying heavily on general statements and a single quote from Dr. @DR1.
3.  The essay contains grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.
4.  The student has not effectively organized the essay, jumping abruptly from discussing the benefits of technology to the potential drawbacks.

The student provides a clear and concise explanation for why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. They effectively connect the new beginning to the themes of growth, renewal, and the protagonist's emotional journey. However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the symbolism of the hibiscus plant and its significance in the story.

The student correctly identifies the contrast between the beginning and the end of the story, noting that Saeng initially felt a ""wave of loss"" but now seems to have found comfort and confidence. They also correctly mention that the geese returning and the hibiscus blooming symbolize a new beginning. However, the student could have explored this symbolism further, explaining how the hibiscus plant specifically represents hope, resilience, or the connection to Saeng's past.

Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the story to support their analysis. For example, they could have mentioned how the hibiscus plant is described as ""budding"" in the final paragraph, which suggests growth and new life. They could have also connected this to the fact that Saeng is planning to retake her driver's test, which represents a new challenge and opportunity for growth.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The essay is a personal anecdote about a situation where the student had to wait to be put back into a soccer game. The student effectively uses descriptive language to convey their emotions and thoughts during this experience.

Strengths:

- The student has a clear and relatable topic, making it easy for the reader to follow their narrative.
- The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the whistle and the feeling of frustration, helps to engage the reader.
- The student attempts to explain the reason behind their coach's decision, showing an effort to analyze the situation.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but falls short in providing a detailed and nuanced analysis of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student identifies the mood as ""happiness and grateful,"" but fails to provide specific evidence from the memoir to support this claim. The statement ""the author is grateful of his parents for having a roof over his head, cooking food for him, and for having such courageous parents"" is a general statement that could be applied to any situation, rather than a specific analysis of the memoir.

The student also lacks clarity in their writing, using phrases such as ""That's the mood of the author in the memoir,"" which does not provide any concrete evidence to support their claim. Furthermore, the student does not consider alternative moods that the author may have created in the memoir, which is an essential aspect of analyzing a literary work.

To improve, the student should focus on providing specific examples from the memoir that demonstrate the author's emotions and tone, and analyze how these elements contribute to the overall mood of the narrative.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a positive impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""For one,"" ""Another effect they have,"" and ""Lets say."" This helps to create a cohesive and easy-to-follow narrative.

The student provides specific examples to support their argument, including the ability to communicate with people across the globe, the efficiency of computers in businesses, and the educational benefits of exploring the world through computers. These examples are relevant and engaging, making the essay more convincing and relatable.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, which makes the writing seem a bit flat. Additionally, there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing commas.

The student also relies heavily on rhetorical questions, such as ""So think, are computers really harmful?"" While this can be an effective technique, it is overused in this essay and comes across as somewhat abrupt. A more polished conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis statement would be more effective.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in the memoir, but their analysis could be more effective with more specific and detailed examples from the text. The student correctly identifies the use of words such as ""brave,"" ""courageous,"" ""strength,"" and ""perseverance"" to create a serious mood, but fails to provide a clear explanation of how these words contribute to the overall mood. Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""marviles painting"" and ""pashen for his parents"" suggests a lack of attention to detail and proofreading.

The student also attempts to describe the mood of the author's home as ""loving and joyful,"" but again, fails to provide specific examples from the text to support this claim. The mention of ""real friendship, and endless celebrations, love and the strength of helping others"" is a good start, but could be more effectively analyzed with more depth and detail.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence in its writing, and there are several areas that require improvement. 

Firstly, the student has identified three main obstacles: structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air. The explanation for the structural problems is somewhat vague, stating that the pressure on the building's foundation would be a concern, but it would be beneficial for the student to provide more specific details from the excerpt to support this claim. 

The student correctly identifies the law that would be broken by allowing dirigibles to dock, citing a law that specifies how low an airship can fly over an urban area. However, the student fails to provide any specific information from the excerpt to support this claim, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of this statement.

The final obstacle mentioned is keeping the dirigible safe in the air, which is a valid concern. The student mentions high winds causing the airship to swing around and potentially break off, as well as the risk of the airship exploding and causing damage to downtown New York City. While these are valid concerns, the student could have provided more specific information from the excerpt to support these claims.

In terms of writing quality, the student's essay is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks organization and coherence.

The writer attempts to provide examples and make connections between patience and its benefits, but the writing is marred by errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the inconsistent use of the word ""pacience"" and ""patience."" The writer seems to be using the two words interchangeably, but ""pacience"" is a misspelling of the correct word. This error is repeated throughout the essay, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

The writer also struggles to provide concrete examples to support their claims about patience. The statement ""A lot of times people are doing something and the get im pacient"" is unclear and lacks specificity. It would be more effective to provide a specific anecdote or scenario to illustrate the point.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simplistic and lacks variety. The essay consists mainly of short, simple sentences that do not engage the reader. The writer could benefit from using more complex sentence structures and descriptive language to make the essay more interesting.

In terms of content, the writer does attempt to make some connections between patience and its benefits. The statement ""Pacience always leads to good things"" is a good starting point, but it could be developed further with more evidence and examples.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the warm, comforting, and happy mood created by the author in the memoir. They have also provided specific details such as the traditional home decor, Cuban music, and the parents' teaching of cooking skills, which contribute to this mood. Additionally, the student has noted the sense of unity and community in the neighborhood, where people looked out for one another and helped those in need.

However, the student could have delved deeper into the analysis by exploring how these specific details contribute to the overall mood.

The student has made an effort to address the prompt, but their response could be improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and depth of analysis. The essay lacks specific details about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, and the connection between the setting and the cyclist's experience is not fully explored. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to describe the physical environment the cyclist encounters, such as ""flat land,"" ""hills,"" ""deserts,"" and ""ghost towns."" These descriptions provide a vivid image of the setting and help the reader understand the cyclist's situation. For example, the student writes, ""he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June."" This sentence effectively conveys the harsh conditions the cyclist faces and how they impact his physical state.

However, the student could have delved deeper into the emotional and psychological effects of the setting on the cyclist. For instance, the student mentions that the cyclist's travels are ""desolate and lonely,"" but does not fully explain how this isolation affects him. Additionally, the student could have explored how the contrast between the desolate landscape and the ghost towns affects the cyclist's determination and motivation.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and complex sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack connecting words or phrases to create a cohesive narrative.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that computers can be detrimental to society due to the risk of addiction and the importance of interacting with family and friends. However, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure, with ideas and sentences often disconnected and lacking coherence.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal anecdotes to support their argument. The example of the student's own experience with excessive computer use and their mother's advice to be safe online is a compelling way to illustrate the potential risks of computer addiction. Additionally, the student effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the reader and encourage them to consider their perspective.

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of sophistication in sentence structure. The writing often feels simplistic and lacks nuance, with ideas presented in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner. The student also relies heavily on clichés, such as comparing the computer to a drug, which detracts from the overall impact of their argument.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more evidence to support the student's claims. While they mention statistics about the number of people addicted to computers, they do not provide any credible sources to back up this information. Additionally, the student's assertion that the computer is the only place where people can lie is an oversimplification and not supported by evidence.

The essay starts by referencing the story ""Do not Exceed Posted Limit,"" but fails to provide a clear connection between the story and the prompt. The student attempts to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the explanation is disjointed and lacks specific examples.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence. The student jumps between different ideas, such as the physical effects of the hills on the cyclist and the metaphorical implications of taking a shortcut. While these ideas are relevant to the prompt, they are not effectively connected to each other. For example, the student mentions the cyclist's physical exhaustion from pedaling up and down hills, but then abruptly shifts to discussing the consequences of dropping out of high school. This lack of coherence makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more specific and detailed examples from the story. For instance, when discussing the hills, the student could have described the cyclist's emotional response to the terrain, such as feeling frustrated or anxious. Additionally, when discussing the metaphorical implications of taking a shortcut, the student could have provided more concrete examples from the story, such as the cyclist's realization that taking a shortcut led to more problems than benefits.

Finally, the student's writing could be improved with more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing or incorrect words, incorrect verb tenses, and missing punctuation.

Evaluation: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's mood, but their analysis could be more in-depth and nuanced. They have identified the overall mood as happiness and thankfulness, which is correct, but they could have provided more specific examples from the text to support their claim. The student also mentions that the mood shifts to sadness in certain paragraphs, which is accurate, but they could have elaborated on the specific events or descriptions that led to this shift.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some areas for improvement. For instance, they use the phrase ""the designer is happy"" which seems out of place in the context of the memoir. Additionally, the sentence ""For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1"" is unclear, as the student does not specify what hardships are being referred to or what paragraph and date they are referring to.

The student also uses some vague terms such as ""peaceful and grateful"" and ""GRATEFUL"" which could be more specific. Furthermore, the student could have provided more analysis of the author's use of language and literary devices to create the mood.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more thorough and accurate. They correctly identify the test that the protagonist, {PERSON}, failed as a test of her memory of her home and the importance of her old country to her. However, their explanation of the phrase ""when they come back"" is somewhat unclear, as they mention the geese returning but also seem to imply that the geese are a metaphor for the {PERSON}'s familiarity with her new country. This ambiguity could be clarified with more specific evidence from the story.

The student also correctly identifies the significance of the hibiscus, but their explanation of its role in the passage is somewhat simplistic. They state that the hibiscus represents the {PERSON} remembering things she has forgotten, but this could be further supported with more detailed analysis of the story. For example, the student could discuss how the {PERSON}'s gentle touch of the hibiscus petal suggests a sense of nostalgia and longing for her old home.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion about the {PERSON} taking the test again when the geese return is somewhat forced and not entirely supported by the passage. While the passage does mention the geese returning, it is not explicitly stated that this will trigger the {PERSON} to take a test. A more nuanced analysis of the passage would be necessary to support this claim.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, such as the difficulty in placing the mooring mast on top of the building due to stress and the cost of strengthening the building. However, the student's writing could be improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

The student's writing is clear in its main idea, but there are some areas where the writing could be more concise and organized. For example, the sentence ""So they build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" seems to be a non-sequitur and could be rephrased to better connect to the previous sentence. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the obstacles faced by the builders, rather than simply stating the facts.

The student's use of transition words and phrases is limited, which makes the essay feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the stress on the building to mentioning the cost of strengthening it. Adding transition words or phrases, such as ""however"" or ""in addition,"" could help to improve the flow of the essay.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from shelves simply because they offend someone. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their position, making the essay relatable and engaging.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by posing a thought-provoking question, ""If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone?"" This question grabs the reader's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The writer provides a personal anecdote about being offended by a book that stereotyped cheerleaders, which helps to illustrate their point that everything can be offensive to someone. This example is relevant and easy to understand.
3.  The student suggests that individuals should ignore or avoid materials that offend them, rather than demanding their removal. This is a reasonable and practical solution.
4.  The writer acknowledges that parents have a responsibility to censor what their children see, hear, and read about, which shows an understanding of the importance of parental guidance.
5.  The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and reiterates the writer's stance on censorship.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from a stronger thesis statement that clearly outlines the writer's position on censorship. The current thesis is somewhat implicit and could be more explicitly stated.
2.  Some sentences are worded awkwardly or contain grammatical errors, which can make the text difficult to follow. For example, ""I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it."" The use of @MONTH1 is also unclear.
3.  The writer could provide more evidence to support their arguments, such as statistics or expert opinions, to make their position more convincing.
4.  The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to create a more engaging reading experience.

The student has attempted to write about patience, but the essay lacks a clear and coherent narrative. The story is fragmented and seems to jump between different ideas without a logical connection. The student mentions waiting in lines at an organization and an event, but fails to provide a clear example of patience in action. The use of phrases such as ""the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient"" and ""you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient"" feels forced and unnatural. The student also uses informal language and slang (""WOW!"", ""I think"") which is not suitable for a formal essay.

The student has also failed to address the prompt's requirement to write about a specific experience of patience. Instead, the essay focuses on the duration of waiting in lines, which is not a demonstration of patience. The student could have used this experience to show how they or their friend remained calm and understanding despite the wait.

Evaluation: The essay lacks a clear and focused response to the prompt, failing to effectively describe the mood created by the author in the memoir. The writer does not provide any specific information from the memoir to support their answer, making it difficult to assess their understanding of the text. The essay title, ""The mood by the author in the memories,"" is vague and does not give any indication of the writer's thought process or analysis.

The writer could have benefited from a more detailed and organized approach to the prompt. They could have started by identifying a specific event or passage from the memoir that evoked a particular mood, and then analyzed how the author's use of language and literary devices contributed to that mood. For example, they could have discussed how the author's use of descriptive language, imagery, or figurative language created a certain atmosphere or emotional tone.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more concrete evidence from the memoir to support their claims.

However, their interpretation of the hibiscus's significance is somewhat off. The student believes the hibiscus reminds Saeng of home, but this is not explicitly stated in the text. Instead, the hibiscus is described as ""budding,"" which suggests new life and growth, and is likely meant to symbolize hope and renewal. The student also misinterprets the comparison between the hibiscus and the ""tird"" they had before, which is likely a typo and should be ""third."" The correct interpretation is that the hibiscus is not like the third one they had before, implying that it is different from the previous experiences or environments they have encountered.

The student correctly identifies the issue with the mooring mast's design, mentioning the potential for strong winds to cause the dirigible to crash into the mast. They also bring up the concern of using lead blocks to hold the dirigible down, which is a valid point, especially considering the height of the building. Furthermore, the student notes the use of hydrogen in non-@CAPS1 dirigibles, which is a crucial safety concern due to its flammability.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often informal, with grammatical errors and lack of proper punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""People spend to much time on the computer"" should be ""People spend too much time on the computer."" Additionally, the student uses colloquial expressions and slang, such as ""jiggily"" and ""buityful,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student also struggles with spelling and capitalization. For example, ""benifit"" should be ""benefit,"" and ""@CAPS5"" should be capitalized as a proper noun. Furthermore, the student's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with some proper nouns capitalized and others not.

In terms of content, the student's argument is somewhat one-sided, with little consideration of the potential benefits of computers. While the student mentions the negative effects of excessive computer use, they do not acknowledge the positive aspects of technology, such as its ability to facilitate communication and access to information.

The student's use of evidence is also limited, with most of the examples being personal anecdotes.

However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the natural and man-made obstacles that prevented the builders from allowing dirigibles to dock. The student provides specific examples, such as the Hindenburg disaster and the laws against low-flying airships, to support their argument. Additionally, the student demonstrates an understanding of the potential risks associated with the project, such as the strong winds that would blow the dirigible into another building's spire.

The essay provides some valid points, such as the idea that people have different perspectives and opinions, and that individuals have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and development of these ideas.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of a relevant quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the argument. The student also attempts to provide examples to support their claim, such as the scenario of a lady and a man having different reactions to the same book. However, these examples are not fully developed and could be more effectively used to illustrate the point.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks sophistication and nuance. The language is simple, and the sentence structure is basic. The use of phrases such as ""I believe that certaine materials"" and ""He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them"" could be improved for more polished writing.

The student's argument could be strengthened by considering counterarguments and providing more evidence to support their position. For example, they could discuss the potential impact of censorship on free speech and the importance of intellectual freedom. They could also explore the role of libraries as a safe space for diverse perspectives and ideas.

The essay attempts to explain the concept of patience by using an analogy of a jungle cat hunting its prey. However, the execution falls short in several areas. Firstly, the comparison between a jungle cat and patience is not well-developed. The cat's ability to stay still and pounce is more related to stealth and strategy rather than patience. The essay fails to clearly connect the cat's actions to the concept of patience. 

Furthermore, the writing lacks clarity and coherence. The sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making it difficult to follow. The use of the word ""patses"" is also incorrect, which suggests a lack of attention to detail.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination and resilience in the face of failure. This final paragraph serves as a poignant reminder of Saeng's unwavering commitment to her goal of passing the driver's test. By linking her decision to take the test again to the blooming of the hibiscus in the spring, the author highlights the connection between Saeng's personal growth and the cyclical nature of life. The hibiscus, which has been a symbol of hope and beauty throughout the story, now represents Saeng's renewed resolve to overcome her setback.

The author's use of the hibiscus as a symbol is a deliberate choice, as it is mentioned earlier in the story as a reminder of Saeng's homeland and a source of comfort. This connection underscores the idea that Saeng's determination is not just about passing the test, but about finding a sense of belonging and identity in her new environment. The fact that the hibiscus blooms in the spring, a time of renewal and rebirth, further emphasizes the idea that Saeng is not giving up, but rather, she is taking a break to recharge and come back stronger.

The author's conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance, hope, and self-discovery that are woven throughout the story.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and concise argument in favor of keeping offensive materials on the shelves. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their stance, which is a commendable aspect of their writing. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the essay to a higher level.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the student's ability to articulate their thoughts and opinions on censorship. They provide specific examples from various media, such as music, movies, books, and magazines, to illustrate their point. The writer also acknowledges the potential drawbacks of these materials, such as gossip and false information in magazines, which demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the issue.

However, the essay suffers from several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""anappropiate"" and ""anapprpiate,"" is also distracting and should be corrected. Additionally, the writer's writing style is often informal, which may not be suitable for a persuasive essay in a newspaper.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more sophisticated transitions between paragraphs and a clearer thesis statement. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing music to movies and then to books, which makes the essay feel disjointed. A stronger thesis statement would also help to guide the reader through the writer's argument and provide a clearer understanding of their position on censorship.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They have identified three main challenges: the structural limitations of the building's roof, safety concerns related to the flammability of hydrogen and the risk of strong winds, and the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. However, the student's analysis could be more thorough and nuanced.

One area for improvement is the lack of depth in discussing the structural limitations of the building's roof. While the student mentions that a mooring mast would put too much stress on the building, they do not provide any further explanation or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the student states that this problem cost over sixty thousand dollars, but does not specify how this cost was calculated or what it represents.

The student also shows a good understanding of the safety concerns related to the dirigibles, including the risk of fire and the impact of strong winds. However, their discussion of these issues is somewhat superficial and could be more detailed. For example, they could have explored the specific measures that the builders could have taken to mitigate these risks.

The student's discussion of the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas is also somewhat cursory. They mention that anchoring a dirigible on the Empire State Building would be illegal, but do not provide any further context or explanation.

Finally, the student concludes that the whole idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ""has disappeared,"" but does not provide any evidence or explanation for this claim. This conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be more fully developed.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing a positive opinion about the effects of computers on people. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, there are several areas that require improvement.

Strengths:

1. The student has provided specific examples of how computers can benefit people, such as doing academic work, talking to friends online, and finding information about famous people.
2. The student has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""But the best thing of all is"" and ""Have you ever wondered how.""
3. The student has attempted to use persuasive language, such as ""I think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world"" and ""Lets be honsest some adults and kids hand writing is like chicken scrach so to say.""

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing is marred by numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and misspelled words.
2. The student has used informal language and slang, such as ""dire,"" ""acidemic,"" ""enernet,"" ""fam'us,"" and ""benfit."" This detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.
3. The student has relied heavily on quotes from an unnamed professor, which may not be credible or relevant to the topic.
4. The student has made unsubstantiated claims, such as ""a professor from virgin new york tech school said that with out computers the world is nothing."" This statement lacks context and credibility.
5. The student has used vague statistics, such as ""@PERCENT1"" and ""@PERCENT2,"" which are not supported by evidence.
6. The student's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured and covers four main points: the structural stress caused by the weight of the dirigible, the flammability of hydrogen, the unpredictable winds at the top of the building, and the law restricting airships from flying low over urban areas. 

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided more specific information from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, they mention that the builders realized the weight of the dirigible would cause stress on the building's frame, but they do not provide any specific details from the excerpt to back this up. Similarly, they mention that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting, but they do not provide any evidence from the excerpt to support this claim.

Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles they mentioned. For example, they could have discussed how the flammability of hydrogen posed a significant risk to the building and its occupants, or how the law restricting airships from flying low over urban areas limited the builders' options for constructing the mast.

Furthermore, the student could have used more precise language and grammar in their essay. For instance, they use the term ""dirible"" instead of ""dirigible,"" and they use the phrase ""was out of the builders control"" instead of ""was beyond the builders' control.""

Evaluation:
The student has attempted to express their opinion on the effects of computers on society, but their essay requires significant improvement in several areas. 

Firstly, the student's writing lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The opening sentence, ""I agree thats computers are good for society,"" is a vague statement that does not provide a clear direction for the reader. A more effective approach would be to start with a stronger statement that outlines the benefits of computers, such as ""Computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and I firmly believe that their benefits outweigh their drawbacks.""

Secondly, the student's essay lacks organization and coherence. The ideas are presented in a random and disconnected manner, making it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, the student jumps from discussing the benefits of computers for elderly people to mentioning the convenience of shopping online while lying in bed. A more effective approach would be to group related ideas together and use transitional phrases to connect them.

Thirdly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and informal language. For instance, ""thats"" should be ""that's,"" ""bodys"" should be ""body,"" and ""swel"" should be ""swell."" The use of slang terms like ""eazy"" and ""dats"" also detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

Lastly, the student fails to address the opposing viewpoint, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing. The essay would be more convincing if the student acknowledged the potential drawbacks of computers and provided a counterargument to their own point of view.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, such as the use of hydrogen by foreign dirigibles and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more detailed and nuanced explanations of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, the student could have explained why the use of hydrogen was a safety concern, or how the law against airships flying too low over urban areas impacted the builders' plans. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the significance of these obstacles and how they relate to the broader context of the Empire State Building's construction.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. The student could also benefit from proofreading to catch small errors in grammar and punctuation.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but lacks depth and specific details to support the claim. The writer starts by stating that the mood is ""love,"" but fails to provide concrete evidence from the memoir to back up this assertion. The mention of the author's parents coming from {LOCATION1} and their struggles initially, followed by hope and happiness, is a good start. However, this idea is not fully developed, and the writer could have explored this theme further.

The writer also mentions the author's love for his culture, which is a good point, but it is not clearly connected to the overall mood of the memoir. The phrase ""Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him"" seems to be a repetition of the initial idea and does not add much to the analysis.

To improve the essay, the writer should have provided more specific examples from the memoir to support the claim about the mood. For instance, they could have described a particular scene or event that illustrates the author's love for his family and culture. Additionally, the writer could have analyzed how the author's experiences and emotions are conveyed through the narrative, which would have added more depth to the analysis.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, such as the constant shifting winds due to violent air currents, the impracticality of using lead dead weights on a crowded city street, and the safety concerns related to flying low over urban areas and the use of hydrogen.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer and more organized structure. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the weather conditions to the safety concerns, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas. Additionally, some sentences are worded vaguely, such as ""the workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction."" This sentence does not provide specific information from the excerpt and could be rephrased to better support the argument.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles. For example, they could have discussed how the shifting winds affected the structural integrity of the building or how the safety concerns led to changes in the design or operation of the mooring mast.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in addressing the prompt, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. One of the main strengths of the essay is that the student has attempted to provide specific information from the excerpt to support their answer. However, the student's understanding of the excerpt is limited, and they have made some incorrect assumptions.

For instance, the student states that the length of the dirigibles was the same as four blocks in New York City. This is not supported by the excerpt, and it is unclear where the student obtained this information. Additionally, the student mentions that the builders needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment, but this is not mentioned in the excerpt.

The student also makes some general statements that are not supported by the excerpt, such as the danger of hydrogen being highly flammable and the instability of the landing site. While these statements may be true in general, they are not relevant to the specific context of the Empire State Building and dirigibles.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be improved in terms of clarity and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the length of the dirigibles to the dangers of hydrogen, and the student could benefit from providing a clearer thesis statement and supporting evidence.

They have provided specific examples of how computers can be used for learning, staying updated with news, and communicating with others. The student's writing is generally clear and easy to understand, making it accessible to the target audience.

However, there are areas that need improvement. The student's writing lacks coherence and organization, making it difficult to follow their train of thought at times. The use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas is limited, resulting in a disjointed flow. Additionally, the student's writing is heavily reliant on simplistic sentence structures, which may not effectively convey their ideas.

The essay ""Rough Road Ahead"" attempts to convey the importance of following instructions and being aware of one's surroundings while cycling. However, the writing lacks clarity and coherence, making it challenging to fully understand the author's intended message. The essay's main idea is somewhat vague, and the connection between the features of the setting and their impact on the cyclist is not explicitly stated.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples to support the author's claim. The statement ""You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things"" is a general reminder, but it does not provide any concrete evidence to illustrate how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the author could have described a situation where a cyclist failed to notice a sign or obstacle due to the setting, and how this led to a negative consequence.

Furthermore, the essay's language is simple and lacks descriptive details. The phrase ""Rough Road Ahead"" is a common warning sign, but the author does not elaborate on what makes the road ""rough"" or how this affects the cyclist. This lack of descriptive language makes it difficult for the reader to visualize the setting and understand its impact on the cyclist.

To improve the essay, the author could provide more specific examples and descriptive language to illustrate the connection between the setting and the cyclist's experience. This would help to create a clearer and more engaging narrative.

The student also fails to consider other possible reasons for the author's conclusion, such as the themes of growth, change, or the cyclical nature of life.

Score: 1

Reasoning: 

The student starts by correctly identifying the author as Minfong Ho, which is a good start. However, their analysis of the conclusion is limited to the girl's determination, which is a valid point but not the only possible interpretation. A more nuanced analysis would consider the themes of growth and change that are present throughout the story. For example, the girl's decision to buy the hibiscus flower in the middle of winter, despite the cold weather, suggests that she is willing to take risks and challenge the norms. This determination is not just about passing a test, but also about growing and learning as a person.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from providing more specific details from the text to support their analysis. For instance, they could have mentioned the girl's vow to herself to ""take that test again"" in the spring, which suggests a sense of anticipation and hope for the future. This detail could have been used to illustrate the girl's determination and growth, and how it relates to the story's conclusion.

Additionally, the student's writing could be improved by providing more complex and varied sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. For example, instead of saying ""she wants to be able to buy the seeds,"" they could say ""she hopes to have the opportunity to purchase the seeds in the spring."" This would demonstrate a more sophisticated understanding of the story and its themes.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas.

Firstly, the student could have provided more detailed and accurate information from the excerpt. For instance, the statement ""The winds current would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it because the wind current is very strong"" is not entirely accurate. The excerpt actually mentions that the wind current would cause the dirigible to drag the building, but it does not specify that the wind current is very strong. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the dirigible's load and wind pressure being transmitted to the building's foundation, such as the exact height of the foundation.

Secondly, the student could have organized the essay more effectively. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the obstacles faced by the builders to Al Smith's decision to make the building taller. A clearer transition between these ideas would have improved the flow of the essay.

For instance, the first sentence, ""I dont think that they should remove music, movies, magazinwa, etc., Should be tooken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldnt be anything to do in your spaire time but be bored,"" is a jumbled mix of thoughts. The student seems to be arguing that censorship is bad because it would lead to boredom, but the sentence structure and word choice make it difficult to follow.

Another issue is the lack of supporting evidence and logical reasoning. The student relies heavily on personal feelings and hypothetical scenarios, such as ""I know alot of people couldn't handle being bored"" and ""How would you feel if you had to drive for @NUM1 hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read?"" While these statements may be relatable, they do not provide concrete evidence to support the student's argument. Additionally, the student fails to address the potential benefits of censorship, such as protecting children from explicit content or promoting a more wholesome environment.

The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are numerous errors throughout the essay, including misspelled words (""magazinwa"" instead of ""magazines""), incorrect verb tenses, and missing articles. These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to take the student's argument seriously.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, effectively arguing against the removal of materials deemed offensive. The essay begins with a thought-provoking statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument. The student skillfully uses personal experience, observations, and reading to support their position.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue, stating that ""you cannot always make everyone happy."" This shows an understanding that censorship is a multifaceted problem, and that there is no straightforward solution. The student also effectively uses the example of the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to illustrate how a work can be considered offensive but still valuable for its historical and educational significance.

The student's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things?"" effectively engages the reader and encourages them to think critically about the issue. Additionally, the student's argument that censorship can limit one's awareness of the world and stifle personal growth is well-supported and convincing.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could benefit from more nuanced and specific examples to support their arguments. For instance, the statement ""any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13"" could be more effectively supported with specific examples or statistics. Additionally, the student could have benefited from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as some of the sentences are quite simple and repetitive.

This conclusion is supported by the details from the story, particularly the image of the winter hibiscus plant. The author uses the plant as a symbol of hope and renewal, as it blooms in the spring despite the harsh winter conditions. This serves as a powerful reminder for Saeng to persevere and try again when the time is right. The use of the phrase ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" creates a vivid image of the changing seasons, underscoring the idea that change is a natural part of life. By ending the story with Saeng's vow to take the test again in the spring, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and hope for Saeng's future.

The essay provides a good summary of the story, but it could be improved by providing more specific details and analysis. For example, the essay states that Saeng's move to @LOCATION1 and failing her driver's exam make her feel helpless, but it would be more effective to explain how these events specifically contribute to her emotional state. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced language and sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again"" could be rephrased for clarity and concision.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but their writing lacks clarity and coherence. They attempt to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but their analysis is limited to a few general statements. The student fails to provide specific and detailed examples from the memoir to support their claims, which makes their argument weak. The use of vague terms such as ""verry good mood"" and ""well-being and happiness"" does not provide a clear picture of the author's intended mood. Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""verry"" instead of ""very"" and ""alot"" instead of ""a lot."" Furthermore, the student's use of the phrase ""I think"" is overused and makes their writing seem uncertain.

The student does attempt to analyze the author's relationship with their family, but their analysis is superficial. They mention that the author appreciates their parents' sacrifices, but they do not explain why this is significant or how it contributes to the mood of the memoir. The student also fails to address the potential complexities of the author's family dynamics, such as any potential conflicts or challenges they may have faced.

To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed examples from the memoir to support their claims. They should also work on using more precise language and avoiding grammatical errors. Additionally, they should strive to provide a more nuanced analysis of the author's relationship with their family and how it contributes to the mood of the memoir.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's tone and has provided specific examples to support their claim. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, grammar, and sentence structure. 

The student correctly identifies the mood as ""happy and warm"" and provides evidence from the text to support this claim. They mention the author's description of his childhood home and the love in his family, which creates a positive atmosphere. The student also notes the author's respect for his parents, which is evident in the way they describe the difficulties his parents faced to provide him with the best life possible.

However, the student could have provided more nuanced analysis of the tone. For instance, they could have explored how the author's description of the difficulties his parents faced adds complexity to the overall mood of the memoir. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific quotes or examples to support their claim about the author's respect for his parents.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures throughout the essay. For example, the sentence ""Rodriguez describes the conection between the family and friends around him, 'countless extended family members came and went...My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us'"" is a run-on sentence that could be broken up for clarity.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks depth and analysis. The student's arguments are mostly based on personal opinions and do not provide any concrete evidence or research to support their claims.
2. The writing is simple and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack descriptive language.
3. The student has not addressed the potential consequences of not removing certain materials from the shelves, such as the impact on vulnerable students who may be exposed to harmful content.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting can affect a cyclist. The writer effectively uses examples to support their conclusion, although there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, and clarity. 

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify and explain the impact of weather conditions on a cyclist. The writer mentions that cold and rainy weather can make a cyclist hesitant to ride, while extremely hot weather can lead to dehydration and exhaustion. These points are well-supported and demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. 

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed and specific examples to support the writer's claims. For instance, the writer mentions that a desert landscape can cause a cyclist to doubt their route, but it would be more effective to provide a specific example or anecdote to illustrate this point. Additionally, the writer could have explored other features of the setting, such as road conditions or traffic, to provide a more comprehensive explanation.

The writer also struggles with grammar and sentence structure, which can make the essay difficult to follow at times. For example, the sentence ""If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope"" is unclear and contains several grammatical errors. The writer could benefit from revising their sentences to improve clarity and coherence.

Furthermore, the writer could have taken the opportunity to provide more nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the topic. For instance, they could have explored how different types of scenery can affect a cyclist's mood or motivation, or how a cyclist's perception of the setting can change over time.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against removing offensive materials from the shelves. The writer effectively conveys their opinion through concise paragraphs and uses relevant examples to support their argument. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by addressing a common concern about censorship, which grabs the reader's attention and sets the tone for the essay.
2.  They provide a valid point about the existence of a children's section in libraries, which serves as a safe space for kids to access age-appropriate content.
3.  The writer also highlights the potential consequences of removing books, such as limiting access to educational materials, which is a crucial consideration in the debate.
4.  The student's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Who knows we might have to vote on it someday,"" adds a sense of engagement and encourages the reader to think critically about the issue.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear thesis statement, which would have provided a more focused direction for the reader and helped to organize the writer's ideas.
2.  The writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words (e.g., ""pepole,"" ""inapropiate,"" ""inconvience""). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.
3.  The writer could have benefited from more nuanced examples to support their argument. For instance, they could have discussed specific books or cases where censorship was implemented and the consequences that followed.
4.  The conclusion feels abrupt and doesn't provide a satisfying summary of the main points or a final thought to leave the reader with.

Evaluation: 
The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal experience, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The writer's use of informal language and grammatical errors makes it challenging to understand the narrative. The story is fragmented, and the transitions between events are unclear. The writer's attempt to describe their experience of waiting for an allgen (likely an amusement park or a theme park) is marred by the use of vague terms and missing details.

The writer's use of language is informal, with the use of abbreviations (e.g., ""l"" instead of ""I"") and colloquial expressions (e.g., ""l had to pace my parents had to stop me from leaving""). This informal tone detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the writer's writing lacks descriptive language, making it difficult to visualize the events being described.

The writer attempts to illustrate the concept of patience by describing a situation where they had to wait for an extended period. However, the writer's frustration and impatience are evident in the narrative, which contradicts the definition of patience provided in the prompt. The writer's desire to leave the floor and the argument with their parents undermine the idea of patience.

The writer's use of numbers (e.g., ""@NUM1 hours,"" ""@NUM2 times"") is unclear and lacks context. The writer could have provided more details about the allgen, the activities they engaged in while waiting, and the emotions they experienced during the wait.

To improve this essay, the writer should focus on using clear and concise language, providing more descriptive details, and adhering to the definition of patience. The writer should also strive to create a more cohesive narrative that effectively conveys the concept of patience.

The student also fails to consider alternative interpretations of the conclusion, which could have added complexity to their analysis.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks specific textual evidence to support their claims. For instance, when discussing Saeng's vow, the student could have referenced the specific details of the hibiscus plant, such as its association with the {LOCATION} where Saeng lives, to add more depth to their analysis.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and insight into the story, failing to provide specific examples or analysis of the narrative.

The student's statement that ""Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes"" is a vague and unclear assertion that does not contribute to the analysis of the story's conclusion. The mention of Saeng's love for spring and the fact that she would play outside all day every day is a superficial observation that does not provide any meaningful insight into the story's themes or the significance of the final paragraph.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt, but their analysis of the mood created by the author in the memoir is somewhat limited and lacks depth. They have identified a few specific quotes from the text, but their interpretation of these quotes is not entirely accurate. The student seems to be focusing on the positive emotions expressed in the memoir, but they do not provide enough evidence to support their claim of a ""very high up, cheerful mood."" For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the quote ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" suggests a sense of gratitude and appreciation, but it does not necessarily evoke a ""high up"" or ""cheerful"" mood. Similarly, in paragraph @NUM2, the quote ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"" highlights the challenges faced by the author's parents, which could potentially create a more complex and nuanced mood.

The student's writing also lacks clarity and coherence, with some sentences being incomplete or awkwardly phrased. For example, the sentence ""It made me feel as if I was there"" is not clearly connected to the rest of the paragraph, and the phrase ""All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood"" feels like a summary statement rather than a thoughtful conclusion.

The essay effectively addresses the prompt by sharing personal anecdotes that illustrate the significance of laughter in forming relationships. The writer's use of specific examples from their experiences on a sports team and with friends showcases the power of laughter in bridging gaps and creating connections with others.

Strengths:

1.  The writer provides concrete and relatable examples from their personal life, making the essay engaging and authentic.
2.  The use of descriptive language, such as ""the spark of interest of wanting to be someone's friend"" and ""laughing until you cry,"" effectively conveys the emotional impact of laughter.
3.  The writer's personal growth and development are evident as they reflect on how laughter has helped them become more social and form meaningful relationships.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the writer's experiences to the prompt's idea that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
2.  Some sentences are wordy or contain grammatical errors, which can disrupt the flow of the essay. For example, ""I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified two significant obstacles: constructing a strong enough frame for the building to hold a 1000-foot dirigible and the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles. The student has also shown an understanding of the flammability of hydrogen and its implications for the builders.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more specific and detailed information from the excerpt. For instance, the student mentions that the builders had to create a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the Empire State Building, but this information is not supported by the excerpt. This suggests that the student may have made an assumption or added their own idea, which is not ideal.

Additionally, the student's writing could be more concise and clear. The sentence ""These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with"" is unclear and seems to be a non-sequitur. It is also unclear what ""@NUM1"" refers to, as the student does not provide a specific number.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The essay is written mainly in simple sentences, which can make it seem a bit flat and lacking in depth.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by writing a letter to the local newspaper, sharing their opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, the essay lacks a clear and focused thesis statement, and the writing is marred by grammatical errors, informal language, and a lack of coherence.

One of the major issues with the essay is the student's failure to address the prompt directly. The essay starts by mentioning a personal anecdote about enjoying the newspaper's puzzles, which is unrelated to the topic. The student then shifts to discussing the negative effects of computers, but the reasons provided are not well-supported and lack specific examples.

The student's writing is also plagued by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of punctuation, and misspelled words. For instance, the sentence ""My @CAPS1 reason is people isn't spending a lot of time with there family"" should be rewritten as ""My first reason is that people are not spending a lot of time with their family."" Additionally, the use of informal language, such as ""I guess,"" ""I say this because,"" and ""You know,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's examples are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence to support their claims. The anecdote about the turkey in the oven is a good start, but it is not fully explained, and the example about online chat rooms is vague and lacks specific details. The student's personal experience of being addicted to the computer is also not well-integrated into the essay and feels like an afterthought.

Despite these issues, the student shows some potential in their writing, particularly in their ability to express their opinion and provide some relevant examples. With more practice and attention to grammar, coherence, and organization, the student can improve their writing significantly.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively expressing their opinion on the benefits of computers. They have provided three main reasons to support their argument: hand-eye coordination, access to information, and staying in touch with distant family and friends. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to make their arguments more convincing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal experiences to illustrate their points. For instance, they mention their own experience of using a computer to stay in touch with their grandmother who lives far away. This makes the essay more relatable and engaging.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the ideas are not well-connected. For example, the second paragraph starts with ""My second reason,"" but it is not clear how it relates to the first paragraph.

Additionally, the student's use of evidence is limited and often inaccurate. For instance, they claim that studies show that a certain percentage of football players have excellent hand-eye coordination due to playing video games, but they do not provide any credible sources to support this claim. This lack of evidence undermines the credibility of their argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and informal language. For example, they use ""thier"" instead of ""their,"" ""secend"" instead of ""second,"" and ""unfortanitly"" instead of ""unfortunately."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In terms of content, the student's arguments are not well-developed. They rely heavily on general statements and personal anecdotes, but they do not provide any nuanced or thoughtful analysis of the topic. For example, they do not consider the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use or the impact of technology on social skills.

Overall, while the student has shown some potential in their writing, they need to work on developing their ideas, using credible evidence, and refining their writing skills.

Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the student often uses incomplete sentences and fragmented thoughts.

The student does attempt to describe a situation where they demonstrated patience, which is a good start.

Firstly, the student has provided some relevant information from the excerpt, such as the safety problems and the law that stated airships cannot fly too low to urban areas. However, the student has not provided enough specific details from the excerpt to support their claims. For example, the student mentions a disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, but does not specify what the disaster was or how it relates to the Empire State Building. This lack of specificity makes the student's argument less convincing.

Secondly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors and lack of clarity. The sentence ""There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas"" is particularly confusing, and the student's use of ""diriibles"" instead of ""dirigibles"" is a distraction. The student also uses the phrase ""many obstacles builders had to face"" without specifying what those obstacles are, which makes the sentence feel vague.

Finally, the student's conclusion that it was not worth making the Empire State Building a dirigible dock is not supported by the excerpt.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and logical flow. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow the argument. For instance, the transition from discussing the characteristics of patient people to the benefits of being patient is abrupt and unclear.

Another issue is the use of simplistic and inaccurate statements.

Similarly, the statement ""people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don’t talk very much even when they do talk they??? talking when people inturupt them"" is confusing and lacks coherence.

However, this example is not fully developed, and the student fails to explain how this experience taught them about patience. The essay also jumps abruptly to a statement about wishing more people were patient, which seems disconnected from the initial definition.

To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and concise thesis statement, supporting it with a well-developed example, and using proper grammar and punctuation. They should also strive to connect their ideas more coherently and avoid abrupt transitions.

The essay is a personal narrative that effectively tells a true story about a memorable moment of laughter shared between the writer and their boyfriend. The writer's use of descriptive language and vivid details helps the reader visualize the scene and feel the emotions of the moment. The essay is well-structured, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that flow logically.

Strengths:

* The writer uses sensory details to describe the scene, such as the ""fields were very wet and soft"" and the image of the boyfriend covered in mud from head to toe.
* The writer effectively uses dialogue to convey the emotions and tone of the moment, such as the boyfriend's determination to get the car unstuck and the writer's laughter.
* The writer shows a good understanding of the importance of laughter in relationships and how it can bring people closer together.

Weaknesses:

* The writer could have provided more context about the relationship between the writer and their boyfriend, such as how long they've been together and what their personalities are like.
* Some of the sentences are a bit long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence ""I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before"" could be broken up for better clarity.
* The writer could have varied their sentence structure more, using a mix of short and long sentences to create a more dynamic rhythm.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has identified three main obstacles faced by the builders: the Hindenburg accident, the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, and the violent and unpredictable wind on top of the building. The student has also provided relevant quotes from the excerpt to support their points, which shows that they have carefully read and analyzed the text.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing could be more polished and concise. Some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future"" could be rephrased as ""The mooring mast seemed like a great idea, but it would have revolutionized travel by allowing dirigibles to dock.""

Secondly, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles. For example, they could have explained why the Hindenburg accident was a significant concern for the builders or how the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas affected their plans.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective. The sentence ""Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad"" is a bit simplistic and doesn't provide a clear summary of the main points made in the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's mood, identifying comfort, sympathy, and a sense of family as the primary emotions evoked by the author. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and specific. The student could have provided more concrete examples from the memoir to support their claims, such as specific quotes or scenes that illustrate these emotions. Additionally, the student could have explored the author's use of language, imagery, and other literary devices to create these moods.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks sophistication and nuance. The transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the student could have provided more evidence to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the shift in mood, the student mentions ""@CAPS1 @NUM1,"" but does not explain what this refers to or how it contributes to the change in mood.

The student's use of vocabulary is adequate, but there are some errors in grammar and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security"" should be ""As the author continues, you cannot help but develop a sense of security."" The student could have also benefited from more varied sentence structures and more precise word choices.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by identifying the positive mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. The student has provided specific examples from the text to support their answer, which is a strength of this essay. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student could have provided a more in-depth analysis of the mood created by the author. While they have identified the positive mood, they could have explored the reasons behind it and how it is sustained throughout the memoir. For instance, they could have discussed how Narciso's descriptions of his family's love, sacrifice, and generosity contribute to the positive mood.

Secondly, the student could have provided more nuanced and varied vocabulary to describe the mood. While they use words like ""positive"" and ""warm,"" they could have used more descriptive language to convey the complexity of the mood. For example, they could have used words like ""heartwarming,"" ""inspiring,"" or ""uplifting"" to describe the mood.

Thirdly, the student could have provided more evidence from the text to support their answer. While they have provided a few quotes, they could have analyzed them more thoroughly and provided more context. For instance, they could have discussed how Narciso's statement about his parents' courage in coming to a new country and culture contributes to the positive mood.

Lastly, the student could have provided a more effective conclusion. While they summarize the mood of the memoir, they could have provided a more thoughtful and reflective conclusion that ties together the main points of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and supporting evidence. 

The student has identified several key challenges, including the use of hydrogen by non-U.S. dirigibles, the risk of wind forces on the building, the use of lead weights, and the legal restrictions on flying low over urban areas. However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support these points. For example, the student mentions the German dirigible crash, but does not provide any context or details about the incident. Additionally, the student could have provided more information about the specific laws and regulations that prohibited flying low over urban areas.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, the sentence ""The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. The writer provides some specific examples to support their argument, such as learning about faraway places and accessing the latest news. However, the writing lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought. The use of informal language, such as ""sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat"" and ""Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1,"" detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation, as evident in the sentence ""computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide."" Additionally, the writer's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with proper nouns and common nouns treated differently. The essay could benefit from more attention to detail and a more formal tone.

The writer attempts to address the counterargument, but it is not fully developed. The statement ""Others have different ideas"" is a good starting point, but it is not followed up with a clear explanation of the opposing viewpoint or a rebuttal.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanation. The student has identified three main obstacles: the size of the dirigibles, strong winds, and the fear of a catastrophic event like the Hindenburg disaster. 

The student's first point about the size of the dirigibles is somewhat vague and does not provide specific information from the excerpt. The mention of hydrogen and helium is relevant, but it is unclear how these gases relate to the issue of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. A more precise explanation would have been helpful.

The second point about the strong winds is a valid concern, but the student does not provide any specific information from the excerpt to support this claim. It would have been beneficial to include a direct quote or a relevant detail from the excerpt to strengthen this argument.

The third point about the Hindenburg disaster is a significant concern, but the student does not provide any specific information from the excerpt to support this claim. The student simply states that the builders were afraid of a similar disaster, but does not explain how this fear impacted their decision-making process.

To improve, the student should provide more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support their claims. They should also strive to provide clear and concise explanations for each point.

The writer starts by stating that they were patient during a visit to the doctor's office, but the narrative quickly becomes confusing. The writer mentions that their brother had to wait outside, but then they both had to wait inside. The use of the phrase ""we stayed patient"" is vague and does not provide specific details about what they were patient about. The writer also uses the phrase ""we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago,"" which is unclear and does not make sense in the context of the story.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak. The essay jumps abruptly from describing the waiting time to asking to go up and ask what was going on. The writer also fails to provide a clear resolution to the story, instead stating that they forgot to sign in and then got in. This conclusion feels abrupt and does not provide a satisfying ending to the narrative.

The writer's writing style is also informal and lacks descriptive language.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the emotions and thoughts of the characters. The writer successfully captures the feelings of @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1, making the reader feel invested in their friendship. The use of phrases such as ""they became vary close friends vary fast"" and ""they enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another"" effectively conveys the joy and happiness of their friendship.

However, there are areas where the writer could improve. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. At times, the writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, the transition from the paragraph discussing @PERSON1's experience in the play to the paragraph about @ORGANIZATION1's background is not smooth.

Additionally, the writer could work on using more precise and varied vocabulary. Phrases such as ""they stared to hang out"" and ""they stared to pay a little more attention"" could be rephrased to make the writing more engaging and polished.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. For example, the sentence ""By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends"" is a run-on sentence that could be broken up for better clarity.

Lastly, the writer could work on providing more depth and analysis in the conclusion.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The essay provides a personal anecdote that showcases the student's experience with patience, which is a commendable approach to addressing the prompt. However, the writing could benefit from more clarity, coherence, and attention to grammar and punctuation.

Strengths:

- The student has attempted to provide a personal example of patience, which is a great way to engage the reader and make the concept more relatable.
- The student has demonstrated an understanding of the concept of patience, including its connection to tolerance and not complaining in the face of difficulties.
- The student has attempted to use descriptive language, such as ""I felt real sick,"" ""I wanted to yell and complain,"" and ""I was pissed off,"" which adds some depth to the narrative.

Weaknesses:

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing against it. They have provided some valid points, such as the importance of free speech and the potential harm caused by limiting access to knowledge. However, their argument is not well-supported and lacks depth.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of organization and coherence. The student jumps between different ideas without connecting them effectively, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, they start by stating that learning is essential for the human race, but then shift to discussing the importance of free speech without explaining how these two ideas are related.

Another issue is the use of vague terms such as ""unorthodox"" and ""offensive,"" which are not clearly defined. The student also fails to provide concrete examples to support their arguments, making it hard to understand their perspective.

On the other hand, the student does attempt to address the opposing view by mentioning minor offenses such as inappropriate language and obscene graphic material. However, their solution of making ""minor adjustments"" to create a ""clean version"" is oversimplified and does not address the complexity of censorship.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses. The tone is somewhat inconsistent, veering between a formal and informal tone.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides relevant information from the excerpt to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and analysis. 

The student starts by mentioning that new technology, especially in aviation, requires work to be done, which is a general statement and not directly related to the prompt. It would be better if the student focused on the specific challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The student correctly identifies the need to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and allow passengers to board and disembark, citing a relevant quote from the text. However, the explanation is brief and lacks depth. The student could have elaborated more on how the builders would achieve this, considering the technical aspects of mooring a dirigible.

The student also mentions the stress a dirigible would put on the building, which is a crucial point. However, the explanation is somewhat unclear, and the student could have provided more details on how the builders would modify the building to accommodate this new situation.

The student's analysis is limited, and they fail to consider other potential obstacles that the builders might have faced. For example, they could have discussed the logistical challenges of having a mooring mast on the Empire State Building, such as the impact on the building's design, the safety concerns for passengers, or the potential disruptions to the surrounding area.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more varied sentence structures. The text is written mainly in simple sentences, which makes it seem a bit flat.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides several examples to support their argument, including the importance of computers in various professions, education, and exploration.

Strengths:

1. The student effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""First of all,"" ""Not only that,"" and ""Lastly."" This helps to create a cohesive and easy-to-follow essay.
2. The student provides specific examples to support their argument, such as the use of computers in architecture, writing, and exploration.
3. The student acknowledges a potential counterargument (people spending too much time on computers) and responds to it by stating that one doesn't have to spend excessive time on the computer.

Weaknesses:

1. The student's writing is informal, with several grammatical errors, such as missing articles (""it's"" instead of ""its""), incorrect verb tenses, and missing punctuation.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, the writing quality is hindered by several issues related to grammar, spelling, and coherence. The writer's ideas are somewhat disjointed, and the transitions between sentences are not smooth. The use of informal language, such as ""thay,"" ""is,"" and ""tipe,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

One of the primary strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify some potential benefits of computers, such as using email to remember tasks, accessing maps, and finding information online. The writer also mentions the possibility of children using computers for educational purposes, such as playing math games. However, the writer fails to address the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, which is a significant aspect of the prompt.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and punctuation. They should also strive to provide a more balanced view of the effects of computers on people, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks. Additionally, the writer could benefit from using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures to convey their ideas more effectively.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer identifies three key features: terrain, lack of provisions, and power of self-determination. However, the essay could benefit from more detailed and specific examples to support the writer's claims. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of vivid imagery to describe the terrain, such as ""sharp rocks"" and ""rough spots."" This helps the reader visualize the challenges the cyclist faces. The writer also attempts to explain the concept of self-determination, stating that it ""kicks in"" when obstacles are encountered. However, the explanation is somewhat vague and could be further developed.

The writer's discussion of the lack of provisions is also somewhat unclear. The statement ""when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can’t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything"" is a good start, but it could be more effectively supported with specific examples or anecdotes.

To improve the essay, the writer could provide more concrete examples and details to illustrate how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, they could describe a specific instance where the cyclist had to navigate through rough terrain or how a lack of provisions impacted their journey. Additionally, the writer could elaborate on the concept of self-determination and provide more evidence to support its importance in overcoming obstacles.

The student has not fully explored the significance of the hibiscus plant as a symbol of hope and perseverance, which is a crucial aspect of the story. Additionally, their conclusion could be more effectively linked to the final paragraph, which is the focus of the prompt.

The student's writing is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks specific textual evidence to support their claims.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure. The writer attempts to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of sensory details to describe the setting, such as ""tall, cool pines"" and ""heat."" These descriptions effectively convey the cyclist's physical and emotional responses to his environment. For instance, the writer states, ""They gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down,"" which shows how the pines positively impacted the cyclist. Similarly, the description of the towns as ""small"" and ""unpromising"" effectively conveys the cyclist's feelings of despair.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the cyclist's encounter with the towns to his experience at the bait house. A clearer connection between these ideas would improve the essay's flow. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""Even further into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory,"" are unclear and contain grammatical errors.

The writer also shows some insight into the cyclist's emotional journey, particularly in the realization that he should not trust the old men who gave him advice. This conclusion is supported by the writer's description of the cyclist's feelings towards the old men, which shifts from ""a feeling of spite"" to gratitude towards the bait house owner.

The student effectively conveys the idea that patience involves being understanding and tolerant, as they and their mom chose to wait in the line despite its length. However, the writing could be improved in several areas.

Strengths:

- The student has a clear and relatable topic, making it easy to follow the narrative.
- The use of descriptive language, such as ""five miles long"" and ""what felt like two days,"" effectively conveys the student's experience.
- The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience and its application in the story.

Weaknesses:

- The writing lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For example, ""big enugh,"" ""oppernutity,"" and ""we were so patient!So we waited,and waited,and waited"" demonstrate a need for improvement in these areas.
- The essay could benefit from more descriptive details about the experience, such as what the student and their mom did while waiting or how they felt during the wait.

The student has attempted to express their opinion on the effects of computers on society, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar. The writing is informal, and the tone is somewhat aggressive, which may not be effective in persuading the readers.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of organization. The student jumps between ideas without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the student starts by stating that computers don't benefit society, but then shifts to discussing the importance of spending time with family and exercising. The connection between these ideas is not explicitly stated, making the essay feel disjointed.

The student also struggles with grammar and spelling. There are numerous errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, ""excersise"" should be spelled ""exercise,"" and ""arangments"" should be spelled ""arrangements."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to take the student's argument seriously.

In terms of content, the student raises some valid concerns about the potential negative effects of excessive computer use, such as decreased physical activity and increased risk of meeting strangers online. However, these ideas are not fully developed, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. For instance, the statement ""computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obiese"" is unclear and lacks supporting evidence.

The essay starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention, but the rest of the essay meanders and fails to provide a clear and well-supported argument.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several instances of misspelled words, incorrect use of commas, and run-on sentences. For example, ""The effects computers have on people is that it's a lot of fun to go on and play, helpful with mostly anything, and you can find just about anything from websites on clothing to maps to the store location."" This sentence is a run-on and contains several grammatical errors.

The student also struggles to provide supporting evidence for their claims. While they mention that computers are helpful and fun, they fail to provide specific examples or details to back up these claims. Additionally, their argument that people have the right to choose what they want to do is not well-supported and seems to be a weak attempt to justify their opinion.

The student's use of transitional phrases and sentences is also lacking. They jump abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to talking about the government and the constitution. This lack of cohesion makes the essay difficult to follow and understand.

The student's writing also lacks depth and nuance. They fail to consider the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, such as the negative impact on physical and mental health. They also fail to acknowledge the potential consequences of relying too heavily on technology.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it could be improved with more detailed analysis and supporting evidence. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the story to illustrate the cyclist's emotional state, but sometimes the transitions between ideas could be smoother. The writer also shows a good attempt at using quotes to support their claims, but the analysis of these quotes could be more in-depth.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to describe the cyclist's emotional state in response to the setting. For example, when the cyclist comes to the ghost town and finds the water pump producing a foul liquid instead of water, the writer effectively conveys the cyclist's sense of hopelessness: ""He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch’s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming “the birds will pick me clean,”"" This quote effectively shows the cyclist's emotional state and how the setting affects him.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis of the setting's features and how they contribute to the cyclist's emotional state. For instance, the writer mentions the ghost town desert, but doesn't fully explain how this setting contributes to the cyclist's sense of hopelessness. Additionally, the writer jumps abruptly from the Welch's factory to the bait shop without fully explaining how the abandoned factory affects the cyclist's emotions.

Furthermore, the writer could improve the transitions between ideas by using more cohesive language and connecting sentences. For example, the sentence ""To the cyclist also was best, then he was “saved” by a bait shop"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better flow.

The student also uses vivid imagery, such as comparing people stuck to their computer screens to a caterpillar in a cocoon, to make their points more relatable and engaging.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear thesis statement and instead jumps between different ideas without connecting them effectively. The use of phrases such as ""Well some features might have more than others"" and ""So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist"" indicates a lack of focus and organization.

The writer does attempt to mention specific features of the setting that might affect the cyclist, such as ""the lack of water,"" ""the poisonous snakes,"" and ""the condition of the road."" However, these examples are not fully developed or explained in relation to how they specifically impact the cyclist. For instance, the writer could have explored how the lack of water might lead to dehydration or how the poisonous snakes might pose a threat to the cyclist's safety.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often imprecise, with errors such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""there were many thing"" instead of ""there were many things."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

The essay is a personal narrative about the writer's experience of getting hurt during a football practice. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to recreate the scene and convey their emotions. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of teammates screaming and the sight of their leg pointing the opposite way, helps the reader visualize the event.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the text, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, ""Iv"" should be ""I've,"" ""pracitce"" should be ""practice,"" and ""peole"" should be ""people.""

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and coherence. Some sentences are short and fragmented, while others are long and convoluted. For instance, the sentence ""The two biggest and best hitters were on defence trying to kill me. I knew that this was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so i do."" could be rephrased for better clarity.

In terms of content, the writer does a good job of describing the event and their emotions, but could delve deeper into the significance of laughter in the story. While the writer mentions that their friends found the situation ""hilasious"" and gave them horrible nicknames, they don't explicitly explain how laughter helped to bring them closer to their friends or how it affected their relationship.

The writer also uses some effective rhetorical devices, such as allusion (comparing their leg to a ""brake"" they've only seen on TV and YouTube) and hyperbole (describing their leg as looking like rubber). However, these devices could be used more effectively to add depth and complexity to the narrative.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has provided a well-structured argument in favor of libraries having the right to decide what materials to display on their shelves. The essay begins with a relevant quote from Katherine Paterson, which effectively sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student has also provided some valid points, such as the idea that people have the right to choose which library to visit and that they can ignore materials they find offensive.

However, the essay is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. The student's use of language is often informal and lacks precision, with phrases such as ""howver"" and ""ohter"" instead of ""however"" and ""other."" Additionally, the student's sentences are often short and lack variety, which makes the essay feel somewhat flat.

The student's arguments could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their claims. For instance, they could discuss specific instances where censorship has been used to remove books or other materials from libraries, and how this has affected the community. They could also explore the idea of intellectual freedom and how it relates to the role of libraries in providing access to information.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main argument and provide a final thought or call to action.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. They have identified three main problems: the need for modifications to the building's roof, the issue of shifting winds, and the law prohibiting dirigibles from landing. However, the student's analysis could be improved by providing more depth and detail in their explanation.

The student correctly cites specific information from the excerpt, such as the shifting winds and the law prohibiting dirigibles from landing. However, they could have provided more context and explanation for these points. For example, they could have discussed how the shifting winds affected the mooring mast and the safety of the dirigible.

Additionally, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. The sentence ""Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there"" feels like a conclusion, but it is not clearly connected to the previous paragraphs.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""The biggest obstacle was nature"" is a bit simplistic and could be rephrased for more clarity.

The essay provides a clear and concise attempt to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the writing could benefit from more specific and detailed analysis of the text. The student has identified the themes of understanding and love, which are indeed present in the memoir, but the explanation is somewhat superficial. 

The student provides a good example of how the author's parents decorated their kitchen in a Cuban way and listened to Cuban music, which suggests a strong sense of cultural heritage. This is a good start, but the student could have delved deeper into the emotional impact of this on the author and how it contributes to the overall mood of the memoir. 

Furthermore, the student's statement that ""even if you're not blood related, when loved ones come together, who care about each other, that's family"" is a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay and seems to be a separate idea that could be explored further. The student could have provided more evidence from the memoir to support this claim and explain how it relates to the mood created by the author.

Additionally, the writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which makes the text feel a bit flat.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to tell a story about patience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's use of language and grammar is informal, with numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. The essay lacks coherence and organization, making it difficult to follow at times. The writer jumps between ideas and sentences without a clear connection between them.

One of the main strengths of the essay is its attempt to provide a personal experience related to the prompt. The writer recounts a story about waiting in line for a long time to meet Chip Foose, which is a good example of patience. However, the writer could have elaborated more on the experience and the emotions involved.

The writer also shows some creativity in their writing, such as using descriptive language to describe the people in front of them as ""nerdy"" and the couple's behavior as having ""no life."" However, this creativity is not consistently applied throughout the essay.

The writer's use of dialogue is also a strength, as it adds a conversational tone to the essay. However, the dialogue is not always accurate in terms of grammar and punctuation.

To improve, the writer should focus on revising their language and grammar skills, as well as organizing their ideas more clearly. They should also consider adding more depth and analysis to their story, rather than simply recounting events.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries raises some valid points, but it requires significant improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and effective argumentation. The writer's main argument is that certain books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, as they may influence children's thoughts and behaviors. However, the essay lacks concrete evidence and logical reasoning to support this claim.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The writer's use of ""efence"" instead of ""offense,"" ""likd"" instead of ""liked,"" and ""tkat"" instead of ""that"" demonstrates a lack of attention to detail and basic writing skills. These errors make it challenging to understand the writer's intended message.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear structure and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from stating that books should be removed to explaining the potential consequences of reading such books. A more logical flow of ideas and transitional phrases would improve the essay's coherence.

In terms of content, the writer's argument relies heavily on a simplistic and unsubstantiated claim that reading certain books will lead to children being ""taught wrong from right."" This statement is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning. The writer also fails to consider the potential benefits of reading diverse perspectives and ideas, even if they may be considered ""offensive"" by some.

The writer's reference to ""vilance"" in books is also unclear and lacks context. What type of violence are they referring to, and how does it relate to the argument about censorship? A more specific and well-supported argument would strengthen the writer's position.

To improve this essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear and well-supported argument, using proper grammar and spelling, and organizing their ideas in a logical and coherent manner.

Evaluation: The student's response attempts to address the prompt but lacks specificity and depth in its analysis. The statement ""to make the reader more intrested"" is a vague reason and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the author's purpose. The phrase ""and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year"" is a correct observation, but it is not fully developed or supported by evidence from the story.

The student fails to consider the significance of the specific details mentioned in the final paragraph, such as the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. These elements are crucial in establishing a sense of cyclical time and the passing of seasons, which is a central theme in the story. By not exploring these details, the student misses an opportunity to provide a more nuanced and insightful analysis.

Furthermore, the student's response does not demonstrate an understanding of the character's emotional journey or the significance of the test that Saeng is determined to take again. The student's conclusion feels abrupt and does not provide a satisfying connection to the rest of the story.

The student has provided some relevant examples, such as the terrain being ""very mild to rough and rolling"" and the obstacles encountered like tumbleweed and snakes, but could have delved deeper into the impact of these features on the cyclist's experience.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the cyclist's emotional state, particularly the feeling of being ""very unsure of where to go"" and the worry of dying from dehydration. This shows that the student can analyze the character's emotions and connect them to the setting.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more specific quotes or descriptions from the text to support the analysis.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on censorship in libraries, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective use of evidence to support their argument. Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Thesis statement**: The essay starts with a vague statement, ""I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok."" A stronger thesis statement would clearly articulate the student's position on censorship, such as ""I believe that books and other reading materials should not be removed from libraries due to their content, as they provide valuable perspectives and experiences for readers.""

2. **Organization**: The essay jumps between ideas without a clear logical flow. The student mentions their personal experience with a book containing curse words, but fails to connect it to the main argument. A more effective approach would be to use the anecdote to illustrate a point about the importance of reading diverse materials.

3. **Evidence**: While the student mentions that many books contain curse words, they do not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim. A more convincing argument would involve citing specific examples of books or studies that demonstrate the value of reading materials with mature themes.

4. **Language and grammar**: The essay contains several grammatical errors, such as ""Many people needs to read them and see what they are about"" (should be ""Many people need to read them..."") and ""I guess thats just how it is now a days"" (should be ""I guess that's just how it is these days""). The student should proofread their work more carefully to ensure clarity and accuracy.

5. **Transitions and connections**: The essay lacks transitional phrases and connections between ideas. For example, the student jumps from discussing curse words to stating that people should learn to get over the fact that many reading materials contain offensive content. A more effective approach would be to use transitional phrases to connect these ideas, such as ""In addition to the presence of curse words, another reason why books should not be removed from libraries is that...""

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The student has provided a personal anecdote about a time when they had to be patient, which is a good start. However, the writing is marred by several grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of coherence in some sentences.

One of the strengths of the essay is that it attempts to provide a specific example of a situation where the student had to be patient. The student describes a scenario where they fell and got hurt, and had to wait for their mom to find band-aids. This shows that the student can think of a time when they had to be patient, which aligns with the prompt.

However, the writing is often unclear and difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""I was already soaked from head to toe but we still kept playing"" is a good start, but the next sentence ""Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge be next to me"" is unclear and lacks proper punctuation. The use of slang words and phrases, such as ""mchother"" and ""rah down the driveway,"" also detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks descriptive language and sensory details, which would help to make the story more engaging and vivid. For example, instead of simply stating that the student was ""soaked from head to toe,"" they could describe how the water felt on their skin or how it made them feel.

In terms of content, the essay could benefit from more analysis and reflection on the concept of patience.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that computers are beneficial for society. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties together the three main reasons provided. The student's writing is mostly coherent, but there are several areas where sentence structure and grammar need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from their personal life to support their arguments. For instance, they mention how their parents use email to communicate with their grandparents and make reservations for vacations. These examples help to make the essay more relatable and engaging.

However, the student's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and run-on sentences. For example, in the sentence ""My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people,"" the student fails to use a comma to separate the two independent clauses. Additionally, the sentence ""My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents"" is a run-on sentence that should be broken up for clarity.

The student also struggles with using transitional phrases and connecting ideas between paragraphs. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of communication to the benefits of meeting new people, and then to the benefits of planning. Adding transitional phrases or sentences to connect these ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, and they often rely on simplistic phrases and sentences. For example, the sentence ""You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way"" could be rephrased to something more sophisticated, such as ""You can also use email to stay in touch with friends and make plans to meet up again.""

In terms of content, the student's arguments are not particularly original or well-supported. While they mention that computers allow people to communicate with others, meet new people, and plan events, they do not provide any evidence or statistics to back up these claims. Additionally, the student's assertion that ""more than half of America use them"" is unsubstantiated and should be supported with data or research.

One of the strengths of the essay is its attempt to provide specific details about the situation, such as waiting for a parking spot, waiting at the office, and waiting for a bed to open up for x-rays. These details help to create a sense of realism and demonstrate the writer's patience in the face of delays and uncertainty.

However, the essay could benefit from more effective sentence structure and grammar. Many sentences are fragmented or contain errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""I was patient, I was patient"" is repetitive and unclear, while ""It took a wile to find a parking spot"" contains a spelling error. Additionally, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the experience.

Furthermore, the essay could be strengthened by more explicit connections between the writer's actions and the concept of patience.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, including incorrect capitalization, punctuation, and verb tense inconsistencies. For instance, the student uses both ""I had to @CAPS1 patient"" and ""I had to @CAPS1 patient one of my most memorable time when,"" which are unclear and confusing. Additionally, the use of ""I was extremly angry"" should be ""I was extremely angry."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks coherence and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, the student shifts from describing the experience of waiting for a guitar to receiving a new one, without a clear connection between the two events. The use of transitions and connecting words would help to improve the flow of the essay.

In terms of content, the student attempts to illustrate the concept of patience by sharing a personal experience. However, the story is not well-developed, and the student fails to explicitly connect the experience to the concept of patience. The student mentions that they were ""so happy"" when they finally received the correct guitar, but this does not directly relate to the idea of patience.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on revising the grammar, punctuation, and verb tense consistency.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the topic of censorship in libraries, but their writing lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar. The essay starts with a clear statement of the topic, but the student's arguments are not well-organized and lack supporting evidence.

One of the major issues with the essay is the student's writing style. The use of informal language, such as ""I dont think this should be allowed"" and ""I'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves,"" makes the essay sound more like a casual conversation than a formal persuasive essay. Additionally, the student's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with some words and phrases written in all capital letters, which can be distracting and difficult to read.

The student attempts to provide three reasons why censorship should not be allowed, but these reasons are not well-developed or supported with evidence. The first reason, about wanting to share a favorite movie or book with a child, is a good start, but it is not fully explored. The second reason, about a favorite song being removed, is more of a personal anecdote than a convincing argument. The third reason, about everyone having their own opinion, is a vague statement that does not address the issue of censorship in libraries.

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of subject-verb agreement errors, missing articles, and incorrect use of commas. These errors make the essay difficult to follow and understand.

Despite these challenges, the student shows some understanding of the topic and quotes a relevant author, Katherine Paterson, to support their argument.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity, organization, and attention to detail. 

The student correctly identifies the challenge of designing a mast to support the weight and wind pressure of a thousand-foot dirigible. They also mention the need to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the mast. The description of the proposed mast design, including its materials and features, is a good attempt to provide specific information from the excerpt.

However, the essay lacks a clear and logical structure. The transition between sentences is abrupt, and the ideas are not fully developed. The student also uses some incorrect phrases, such as ""plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" and ""steeped-back design,"" which may not accurately reflect the original text. Additionally, the sentence ""For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery"" is unclear and may not be supported by the excerpt.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on providing a clear and logical structure, using more precise language, and ensuring that the ideas are fully developed. They should also proofread the essay for grammar and punctuation errors.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific examples and details from the excerpt to support the writer's claims. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Strengths:

* The student has identified two significant obstacles faced by the builders: the stress on the building's framework and the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles and high wind speeds.
* The student has provided specific details from the excerpt to support their claims, such as the cost of modifications to the building's frame and the incident involving the Hindenburg.
* The student has also mentioned the law against airships in urban areas, which shows an understanding of the broader context.

Weaknesses:

* The essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The current opening sentence is a bit vague and could be more specific.
* Some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area."" could be broken up into two separate sentences for better flow.
* The student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have discussed the implications of the stress on the building's framework or the potential consequences of an accident involving a hydrogen-filled dirigible.
* The essay could benefit from more transitional phrases to connect the ideas between paragraphs and make the writing flow better.

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay jumps between different ideas without a clear connection between them. The student fails to provide a clear thesis statement that ties the features of the setting to the cyclist's experience. The examples provided are not effectively linked to the main idea, making it difficult to understand the student's point.

The student mentions the climate, road, and town as features of the setting that affect the cyclist. However, the examples given are not well-supported and lack specific details. For instance, the quote ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit"" is mentioned, but its relevance to the cyclist's experience is not clearly explained. The student also fails to provide a clear connection between the warning sign and the cyclist's physical condition, such as thirst.

The student's writing also contains grammatical errors, such as ""anthor"" instead of ""another"" and ""No waters"" instead of ""no water."" Additionally, the sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making the essay seem flat and unengaging.

The student's use of descriptive language is limited, and the essay lacks vivid imagery. For example, when describing the town, the student says it ""might have been a thriving little spot at one point but another warning it fit the outsides of ghost town."" This sentence is unclear and lacks specificity.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, advocating for the separation of books by age rather than removal. The writer effectively uses personal experience and observations to support their argument, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and development in several areas.

Strengths:

1.  The writer begins by addressing the prompt directly, engaging with the quote from Katherine Paterson, which shows an attempt to engage with the topic and demonstrate understanding.
2.  The student proposes a practical solution to the issue of censorship by suggesting the separation of books by age, which is a reasonable and feasible approach.
3.  The writer provides a relatable example of a teenager searching for a book for a school project, highlighting the potential consequences of censorship.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the writer's argument.
2.  The writer relies heavily on simplistic and vague statements, such as ""it would make things easier and faster to find the book of your selection,"" which could be more effectively supported with specific examples or evidence.
3.  The essay could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful consideration of the complexities surrounding censorship, such as the potential impact on marginalized communities or the role of parental discretion.
4.  The writing style is often informal and lacks polish, with errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling (e.g., ""magizenes"" instead of ""magazines"").

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the flat roof of the building, the potential stress and wind pressure on the frame, and the law against airships flying too low. However, the essay could be improved in several areas.

Firstly, the student could have provided more details about the design of the mooring mast and how it was intended to work. The statement ""it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street"" is unclear and lacks coherence. It seems that the student is trying to convey the idea that the mooring mast was not feasible due to safety concerns, but the sentence is poorly written and confusing.

Secondly, the student could have provided more analysis of the law against airships flying too low. The statement ""A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low"" is a good start, but the student could have explained the significance of this law and how it impacted the builders' plans.

Lastly, the student could have provided more evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. While the student mentions that two dirigibles had attempted to moor at the Empire State Building, they could have provided more details about these attempts, such as the dates and the outcomes.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that removing offensive materials from shelves is not an effective solution. The writer effectively uses examples from personal experience and observations to support their position. One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

The writer's argument is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. They effectively address potential counterarguments, such as the concern for younger children's exposure to mature content, by suggesting alternative solutions like age limits and parental monitoring.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as citing a particular book or movie that was removed from a library and the impact it had on readers. Additionally, the writer could have explored the potential consequences of censorship on free speech and intellectual freedom.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas is limited, which makes the essay feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, the transition between the second and third body paragraphs could be smoother. Furthermore, the writer could have varied their sentence structure to create more interest and variety.

The writer's tone is generally persuasive and engaging, but there are moments where the tone feels somewhat casual, such as in the final sentence. The writer could have ended the essay on a stronger note by reiterating their main point and providing a final thought-provoking statement.

The essay effectively tells a true story about a personal experience where laughter played a significant role in helping the writer cope with a difficult situation. The writer's narrative is engaging and easy to follow, with a clear structure that includes a setup, a turning point, and a resolution. The writer's use of descriptive language helps the reader visualize the scene, making it easier to become invested in the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to convey their emotions and thoughts in a way that is relatable to the reader. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I had a lot of trouble falling asleep that night though"" and ""It was hard not knowing what was going on with him"" effectively convey their anxiety and concern for their brother's well-being. The writer also does a good job of showing how laughter helped them cope with the situation, particularly through the use of examples such as their friends telling jokes at school and the writer's family being there to support them.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. One of the main issues is with sentence structure and grammar. There are several places where the writer could improve sentence clarity and concision. For example, the sentence ""My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different"" could be rephrased to ""My mom stayed with him in the hospital, which made things different at home."" Additionally, there are some places where the writer could use more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the scene. For example, instead of saying ""the bone sticking out of his leg,"" the writer could say ""the bone was protruding from his leg.""

Another area for improvement is in the writer's use of transitions between paragraphs. While the writer does a good job of setting up the story, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from describing the accident to talking about the writer's experience at school. A transition sentence or phrase could help to connect the two ideas more smoothly.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more attention to detail in terms of grammar and punctuation. There are several places where the writer could improve their use of commas, periods, and other punctuation marks to make the text easier to read.

The writer's use of the words ""happy"" and ""greatful"" to describe the mood is a good starting point, but it lacks depth and specific examples from the memoir to back up the claim. 

The essay mentions that the author's home is a ""tradition Cuban home"" with the kitchen as its ""hearth,"" which suggests a warm and welcoming atmosphere. However, this idea is not fully explored or connected to the overall mood of the memoir. The writer also mentions Narciso's appreciation for his parents' cooking skills and their generosity in hosting family and friends, but these points are not developed or analyzed in relation to the mood.

Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""He was greatful for them doing everything they could so their kids could have a greater life"" and ""He is greatful to them for ever more"" is repetitive and lacks clarity. The writer could have provided more specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support their claims and make the analysis more convincing.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing more specific and detailed analysis of the memoir, using quotes and examples to support their claims. They should also work on varying their sentence structure and vocabulary to create a more engaging and polished essay.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The student has attempted to share a personal experience related to patience, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and incomplete sentences. 

One of the strengths of the essay is its attempt to describe a personal experience, which is a good way to engage the reader and make the writing more relatable. However, the narrative is disjointed, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the essay jumps abruptly from describing the scenery to mentioning a sign that says ""you are how leaving @LOCATION3"" and another sign that says ""you are how entering @LOCATION1."" This lack of coherence makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Another area that needs improvement is grammar and sentence structure. The essay is filled with errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line"" should be rewritten as ""One day my family and I were going to @PERSON1 to see Jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line."" This correction would improve the clarity and readability of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. For instance, instead of saying ""we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there,"" the student could have described the city in more detail, such as ""we saw the towering skyscrapers of @LOCATION4 and the bustling streets filled with people.""

The student's conclusion, ""That’s my example of patience,"" feels abrupt and doesn't provide a clear connection to the rest of the essay. A more effective conclusion would summarize the key points made in the essay and reiterate the importance of patience.

The use of phrases such as ""It takes patience when you are out hunting"" and ""After about @NUM1 deer seasons my patience paryed off"" suggests a good understanding of the prompt, but the writing could be more polished.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors and typos. For instance, ""paryed"" should be spelled as ""paid off,"" and ""regin"" should be ""region."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the writer's intended message.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to engage the reader. The writer mentions being in a stand and waiting for a deer, but the description is quite vague. Adding more sensory details, such as what the writer saw, heard, or felt during this experience, would help the reader visualize the scene and become more invested in the story.

The writer also struggles to connect the experience to the concept of patience. While the essay mentions that the writer was patient, it would be more effective to explicitly explain how the experience taught them about patience or how they demonstrated patience during the experience.

The writer's use of descriptive language and vivid details helps the reader visualize the scene and become immersed in the story. The writer's enthusiasm and excitement about dueling cards are contagious, making the reader feel like they are experiencing it alongside the writer.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to establish a clear and relatable main character. The writer's nervousness about the new school and their eagerness to fit in are emotions that many students can identify with. The writer's transformation from a bystander to a participant in the dueling game is well-paced and engaging.

The student also fails to provide a clear explanation of how the poorly paved roads and the juice factory and well contribute to the cyclist's experience.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""kiiled"" instead of ""killed"" and ""taunted"" instead of ""reminded."" Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, making the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its explanation. The student has attempted to connect the desert environment to the cyclist's physical and mental state, but the connections are not fully developed.

The student correctly identifies the desert environment as a challenging setting for the cyclist, mentioning the heat and lack of vegetation. The mention of tumbleweeds is a good example of how the setting can affect the cyclist's mental state, as it suggests a sense of isolation and desolation. However, the student could have explored these ideas further and provided more specific examples to support their claims.

The student also mentions the fish bait shop as a source of relief for the cyclist, but this seems to be a sudden and unexplained twist. It is unclear how the shop would provide relief, and the student does not explain the significance of the shop in relation to the setting.

To improve the essay, the student could have provided more specific and detailed descriptions of the setting and its effects on the cyclist. They could have also explored the connections between the setting and the cyclist's physical and mental state in more depth.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified three main obstacles: the stress it would put on the building's frame, the shifting winds, and the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The student has also provided relevant quotes from the excerpt to support these points, which is excellent.

However, there are some grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay. For example, ""obsticles"" should be spelled as ""obstacles,"" ""thousand-foot"" should be written as ""thousand feet,"" and ""enviroment"" should be spelled as ""environment."" Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply stating them.

Furthermore, the student could have benefited from using transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. For instance, the student could have used a transition word or phrase to connect the discussion of the building's frame to the discussion of the winds.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses and subject-verb agreement issues.

For instance, the student states, ""There is a lot of careing and happiness in this story."" However, this sentence is unclear and lacks specific examples to support the claim. The student also fails to provide concrete evidence from the memoir to illustrate the author's emotions and the events that evoke those emotions.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""he cares that his parent made the house traditional Just like back in Cuba"" could be rephrased to convey a more nuanced understanding of the author's emotions and experiences.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay fails to effectively explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The student mentions three reasons (distance, water, and heat) but does not provide a clear connection between these factors and their impact on the cyclist. The sentence ""As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat"" is a good start, but it is not supported by any concrete evidence from the essay. The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion that ties together the effects of the setting on the cyclist.

The student's writing also shows some grammatical errors, such as ""were very challenging for three reasons"" (should be ""was"") and ""the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist"" (should be ""the effect of the heat was clearly described by the cyclist"").

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses sensory details from the setting to support their conclusion. However, there are areas that require improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of vivid and descriptive language to describe the setting. For instance, the writer mentions a ""beating sun"" and ""rushing rivers,"" which effectively conveys the dynamic and energetic atmosphere of the scene. The comparison of the river to a ""rushing"" rather than a ""violent"" one also shows a good understanding of the nuances of language. Additionally, the writer's use of words like ""ramshackle"" and ""forsaken"" to describe the shed and corral effectively conveys a sense of neglect and decay.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive and logical connections between ideas. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the setting to stating that the cyclist starts feeling despair. A clearer transition or explanation would help to strengthen the argument. Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors, such as the use of ""souding"" instead of ""sounding"" and ""battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist,"" which is a bit unclear.

The student attempts to provide a clear explanation for the author's decision to conclude the story with the given paragraph. However, their analysis lacks depth and is somewhat simplistic. They correctly identify that the author intends to return to the plant in the spring, but they fail to consider the emotional significance of this decision. The student also misinterprets the author's motivation for taking care of the plant, stating that it is because it reminds her of her hometown. While this is partially correct, the text actually suggests that the plant is a symbol of her past life, as evidenced by the fact that she vows to return to it when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, which are likely seasonal events in her new location. This implies that the plant serves as a connection to her past, rather than simply a reminder of her hometown.

The student also fails to consider the narrative significance of the conclusion, which is not just about the author's decision to return to the plant, but also about the themes of hope and renewal that are present throughout the story. The use of the geese and the hibiscus as seasonal markers creates a sense of cyclical time, suggesting that the author's life will continue to change and evolve, but that she will always have a connection to her past.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The transitions between sentences are sometimes abrupt, and the ideas could be better connected. For instance, the sentence ""One of the greatest obstacles however was nature itself"" feels disconnected from the previous sentence. A more logical connection between the two ideas would improve the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student could provide more specific details from the excerpt to support their claims. While they mention that hydrogen is flammable, they do not explain why this is a significant concern. Additionally, they could elaborate on the consequences of a dirigible fire over a densely populated area.

Evaluation:

The student's essay on censorship in libraries demonstrates a clear stance against censorship, but it lacks depth and coherence in its argumentation. The writer's main point is that individuals should not be offended by materials they find objectionable and should simply choose not to engage with them. However, this argument is not well-supported and often relies on simplistic reasoning.

One of the primary issues with the essay is its grammatical and spelling errors, which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing. The use of colloquial language, such as ""u,"" ""dont,"" and ""beucas,"" creates a tone that is more suitable for informal communication than a persuasive essay. Additionally, the writer's failure to use proper punctuation and capitalization makes it difficult to follow their train of thought.

In terms of content, the essay relies heavily on a false dichotomy, suggesting that if individuals are allowed to remove materials they find objectionable, then no books will be left on the shelves. This oversimplifies the complexities of censorship and ignores the fact that many people may be offended by materials that others find harmless. The writer also fails to consider the potential impact of censorship on marginalized communities, who may rely on libraries as a source of representation and validation.

Furthermore, the essay lacks concrete examples and evidence to support the writer's claims. The only example provided is a vague reference to TV shows, which is not directly relevant to the topic of censorship in libraries. The writer also fails to engage with the quote provided at the beginning of the prompt, which could have been used to add depth and nuance to their argument.

Overall, while the student demonstrates a clear stance on the issue of censorship, their argument is not well-supported and is marred by grammatical and spelling errors.

The essay is also marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and informal language, which detract from the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the potential negative effects of excessive computer use, such as addiction, social isolation, and health problems. They also mention the financial burden of repairing or replacing computers due to viruses. However, these points are not fully developed, and the student could have provided more concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.

The student's writing style is often informal, with the use of abbreviations (e.g., ""@CAPS4""), colloquial expressions (e.g., ""they dont even go outside""), and incomplete sentences. This makes the essay seem more like a series of disconnected thoughts rather than a cohesive argument. Additionally, the student could have benefited from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story. The essay provides specific examples from the narrative to support the conclusion, which is a strong aspect of this piece of writing. However, there are areas where the student could improve to elevate the writing quality.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and describe the harsh conditions of the desert setting, such as the heat, remoteness, lack of water sources, and presence of a poisonous snake. For instance, the student effectively uses quotes from the narrative to illustrate the difficulties the cyclist faces, such as the ""tarlike substance"" that oozes out of the rusted water pump. This shows that the student can analyze the text and provide concrete evidence to support their claims.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed analysis and explanation of how these setting features affect the cyclist. At times, the student simply states the challenges the cyclist faces without fully exploring the impact of these challenges on the cyclist's experience. For example, while the student mentions that the hills require more energy, they do not fully explain how this affects the cyclist's physical and emotional state.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack connecting words or phrases to create a cohesive flow. For instance, the sentence ""There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist."" could be rephrased to ""The presence of a poisonous snake on the road posed a significant threat to the cyclist's safety.""

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, arguing that materials deemed offensive should not be removed from library shelves. The writer effectively uses everyday examples to illustrate the point that various genres of movies can be considered offensive to different individuals. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and organization to strengthen its persuasive argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of a relatable scenario, making it easier for the reader to understand the writer's perspective. The writer also attempts to address the counterargument by suggesting that individuals should not make a big deal about items they find offensive. However, this point could be further developed to provide more convincing evidence and logical reasoning.

The writer's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, considering the middle school level. However, there are some errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the writer uses ""comidey"" instead of ""comedy,"" ""advinture"" instead of ""adventure,"" and ""ecnore"" instead of ""encourage."" Additionally, the writer fails to capitalize the first word of sentences and uses inconsistent punctuation.

To improve the essay, the writer could benefit from more evidence-based arguments, such as citing examples of books or movies that have been challenged or banned in the past, and discussing the impact of censorship on freedom of expression. The writer could also work on refining their writing skills, including proofreading for errors and using more sophisticated vocabulary.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its writing. The student has identified some of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the explanation is brief and lacks specific details. The student mentions that a thousand-foot dirigible would put stress on the building's frame, which is a correct observation, but fails to elaborate on how this would impact the building's structure. Additionally, the student mentions that over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were made to the building's framework, but does not provide any context or explanation for this figure.

The essay also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""obstacals"" instead of ""obstacles,"" ""theese"" instead of ""these,"" and ""fam"" instead of ""family."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but falls short in providing a clear and well-supported analysis. The writer identifies the author's gratitude towards their parents and the Cuban music as the source of the upbeat and happy mood. However, the analysis is limited to a single sentence and lacks depth. The writer fails to provide specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support their claim, making the statement seem unsubstantiated.

The writer also uses informal language, such as ""upbeat & happy mood"" and ""This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir,"" which detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay. Furthermore, the writer does not provide any evidence of understanding the author's emotions or the context in which the memoir is set, which is crucial in analyzing the mood.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides specific examples to support their claims, such as the development of hand-eye coordination through typing and the ability to stay organized.

However, there are several areas for improvement. The student's writing is often informal, with grammatical errors and misspellings throughout the essay. For example, ""negitive"" should be spelled as ""negative,"" ""beleve"" should be spelled as ""believe,"" and ""alway"" should be spelled as ""always."" Additionally, the student's sentence structure is sometimes simplistic, with a lack of varied sentence lengths and complexity.

The student also struggles with using transitional phrases and connecting ideas between paragraphs. For instance, the transition from the first body paragraph to the second is abrupt, and the student could have used a more effective transition to connect the ideas. Furthermore, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with repetitive use of words such as ""good"" and ""positive.""

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on society. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the writer's use of language and grammar is a significant concern. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the writing. For instance, the writer uses ""heerd"" instead of ""heard,"" ""me"" instead of ""my,"" and ""it less your hand"" instead of ""it helps your hand."" These errors make the text difficult to read and understand.

Secondly, the writer's organization and structure could be improved. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth. For example, the writer starts by stating that computers benefit society, but then jumps to discussing how computers help with schoolwork without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

Thirdly, the writer's supporting evidence is limited and lacks depth. While the writer mentions that computers help with communication, schoolwork, and finding information, these points are not fully developed or supported with specific examples. For instance, the writer claims that computers help with schoolwork, but does not provide any concrete examples of how this is the case.

Lastly, the writer's writing style is informal and lacks sophistication. The use of phrases such as ""read on so I can explain my reasons"" and ""i hope you have enjoyed rading this"" detract from the overall professionalism of the writing.

* The student also fails to consider other possible reasons for the author's conclusion, such as the themes of hope and resilience. The story's ending suggests that Saeng is not giving up, but rather finding a way to hold onto her past while moving forward.

The student starts by mentioning a time when they were impatient, which contradicts the prompt's requirement to write about patience. The narrative jumps abruptly between different events, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events.

The student's writing is also plagued by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

The essay starts with a clear thesis statement, but the supporting reasons are not well-developed and lack specific examples. The student relies heavily on personal anecdotes, which, although relevant, are not sufficient to persuade the readers.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of commas. For example, ""My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family"" should be ""My opinion is that people spend too much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family.""

The writer's argument is somewhat disjointed, and the writing is marred by numerous spelling and grammatical errors. The use of words such as ""tnachnolage"" and ""tnachnolige"" instead of ""technology"" and ""technological"" indicates a lack of attention to detail and proofreading.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the writer states that technology helped humans go to the moon, but this point is not developed further. The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying on vague statements such as ""tnachnolage evans as we maech at.""

The writer's use of language is also a concern. The frequent use of misspelled words and incorrect verb tenses makes the essay difficult to read and understand. Additionally, the writer's tone is not persuasive, and the language is not engaging or convincing.

However, the writer does attempt to address the opposing viewpoint, stating that some people use technology for negative purposes, such as playing video games. This shows that the writer is aware of the potential drawbacks of technology, but they do not develop this idea further.

Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be rephrased for clarity. The writer also relies heavily on vague terms such as ""negative effect"" and ""affect,"" which could be more specific and precise.

The writer's use of transitions between paragraphs is also somewhat abrupt, and the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking words and phrases to connect the ideas between paragraphs. Furthermore, some of the sentences are not fully developed, and the writer could provide more evidence to support their claims.

The writer's use of vocabulary is generally good, but there are some instances of overuse of certain words, such as ""becoming"" and ""more and more."" The writer could also benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Overall, the writer presents a clear and well-structured argument, but could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. With some revisions, this essay could be even more effective in persuading readers to agree with the writer's opinion.

The essay is a personal narrative that effectively tells the story of how the writer met and became friends with two people, @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, through shared experiences of laughter. The writer's use of descriptive language and vivid details helps the reader visualize the events and emotions described in the essay.

Strengths:

1. The writer has a clear and engaging writing style, making it easy to follow the narrative.
2. The use of sensory details, such as the feeling of faces going ""cherry red"" and the sound of paintballs hitting the writer's mask, effectively conveys the intensity of the laughter.
3. The writer does a good job of showing the development of the relationships with @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, from initial awkwardness to deep friendship.
4. The essay effectively uses the prompt's theme of laughter as a way to connect people, highlighting its importance in building relationships.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and lengths to create a more dynamic rhythm.
2. Some sentences are wordy or contain unnecessary words, making them difficult to follow.
3. The writer could provide more specific details about the settings and events, such as the location of ""The @CAPS5"" and the specific games played at the paintball field.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at writing about patience, but it falls short in several areas. The student has provided a personal anecdote about a fishing trip, which is a good start. However, the writing lacks coherence and clarity in some sections. The student jumps between ideas and events without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of descriptive language, such as ""huge cliffs and hills,"" ""clear mud hole with millions of frogs,"" and ""roasted hotdogs over the fire."" These descriptions help the reader visualize the scene and engage with the story.

However, the student struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. For example, ""I was so tierd I could barely see @CAPS8 we had to be at my uncles house at @NUM2"" should be ""I was so tired I could barely see; we had to be at my uncle's house at @NUM2.""

The student also fails to explicitly connect the story to the concept of patience. While the narrative does show moments of waiting and perseverance, the student could have more clearly linked these events to the definition of patience provided in the prompt.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear thesis statement or a logical structure to support their claims. The essay jumps abruptly from one point to another without connecting the ideas effectively.

The writer mentions that the directions given by the elderly were incorrect, which led to the cyclist getting lost. However, this statement is not supported by any evidence from the essay. It is unclear what specific directions were given or how they were incorrect. This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the writer's point.

The writer also mentions that the lack of water led to the cyclist sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. This statement is not supported by any evidence from the essay and seems to be an unrelated claim. The writer does not provide any context or explanation for why the cyclist would suck pebbles or how this relates to the setting.

The writer does mention that the rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy, which is a valid point. However, this statement is not developed or supported with any evidence from the essay. The writer does not explain how the rolling hills specifically affected the cyclist's energy levels or provide any examples to illustrate this point.

To improve this essay, the writer should provide a clear thesis statement, develop each point with evidence and examples, and connect the ideas logically. The writer should also ensure that each claim is supported by evidence from the essay.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks a clear and coherent narrative. The writer starts by stating that their mom is patient, but fails to provide a specific example or story to support this claim. Instead, the essay focuses on the writer's phone usage and their mom's need to use the phone. This does not effectively demonstrate the concept of patience. The writer also struggles with grammar, sentence structure, and clarity, making it difficult to understand the intended message.

The essay could benefit from more descriptive language and a clear connection to the prompt. The writer should have provided a specific story or anecdote that showcases their mom's patience, such as a situation where she waited for the writer to finish a task or conversation before using the phone. This would have helped to illustrate the concept of patience and made the essay more engaging.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and analysis. The student has attempted to identify the mood created by the author in the memoir and has provided specific examples from the text to support their answer. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth.

The student has correctly identified the mood as warm, motivative, and inviting, and has provided examples from the text to support this claim. For instance, the description of the ""warmth of his kitchen"" and the ""aromas of the kitchen"" effectively convey a sense of warmth and hospitality. Additionally, the student has highlighted the author's parents' generosity and perseverance as motivative factors, which is a good start.

However, the student's analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. For example, they could have explored how the author's use of sensory details, such as the ""passionate Cuban music"" and the ""aromas of the kitchen,"" contributes to the warm and inviting mood. They could also have analyzed how the author's description of his parents' perseverance and generosity is not only motivative but also reflective of the author's own values and identity.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and more varied sentence structures. The essay feels a bit disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite simple and lack detail.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides three main reasons to support their position: the need for books for school projects, the importance of respecting individual opinions, and the ease of ignoring offensive content.

Strengths:

1.  The student effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their arguments, making the essay more relatable and engaging.
2.  The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of access to information and the potential consequences of censorship.
3.  The essay is well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear conclusion.

Weaknesses:

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear thesis statement or a well-structured argument, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the hotness of the setting to the cyclist's struggles with water and then to the road conditions. This lack of cohesion and organization makes it difficult to understand the writer's point.

The writer attempts to provide examples from the essay to support their conclusion, but these examples are not effectively connected to the main idea. For instance, the writer mentions that the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old, but this is not clearly linked to how the hotness of the setting affects the cyclist. Similarly, the writer states that the road turned into bumpy terrain, but this is not explicitly connected to the cyclist's struggles.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar, with several run-on sentences and missing articles. For example, ""So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way"" is a sentence that is difficult to understand due to its grammatical errors. Additionally, the writer uses simplistic vocabulary and lacks descriptive language, which makes the essay feel flat and unengaging.

The student's conclusion that Saeng needs to change herself and work harder to get what she wants is a good takeaway from the story, but it is not a direct result of the last paragraph.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the benefits of computers, such as improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information, and facilitating communication. The student has also used transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow smoothly.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing is often informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation.

Additionally, the student has used some incorrect capitalization and spelling, such as ""hand eye coordination"" instead of ""hand-eye coordination.""

The student also needs to work on providing more nuanced and detailed explanations of their ideas. For example, when discussing the benefits of computers, the student simply states that they ""help people everywhere in the world learn about that they couldnt learn about with books."" A more detailed explanation of how computers provide access to information and how this benefits people would strengthen the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion and its significance. They have identified the hopeful tone and the use of symbols in the final paragraph, which is a crucial aspect of the story. However, there are areas where the student's analysis could be improved.

Firstly, the student's explanation of the author's intentions behind the conclusion is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They state that the author wanted to give the ending a hopeful tone and reveal Saeng's strength, but they do not provide specific evidence from the text to support these claims. For instance, they could have mentioned how Saeng's vow to take the test again in the spring suggests her determination and resilience, which are key aspects of her character.

Secondly, the student's analysis of the symbols is limited. They correctly identify the geese and hibiscus as symbols, but they do not provide a clear explanation of how these symbols relate to the spring. They could have discussed how the geese represent the new environment Saeng is adapting to, while the hibiscus represents her past or her old home, as mentioned in the story. This analysis could have been further developed by exploring how these symbols create a sense of contrast and highlight Saeng's growth.

Evaluation: 
The student has made an attempt to explain why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. However, their response lacks depth and clarity. They seem to misunderstand the significance of the paragraph, interpreting it as a reference to the snow's impact on the garden, rather than a personal promise made by Saeng. The student fails to consider the emotional and thematic aspects of the conclusion, which is a crucial aspect of literary analysis.

The student's response is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""This saying is saying,"" which is a confusing and incorrect phrase. Additionally, the sentence structure is simplistic and lacks variety, making it difficult to follow. The student's writing could benefit from more complex sentences and a more nuanced understanding of the story.

Furthermore, the student's analysis is not supported by specific examples from the story. They mention that the story is about ""how the flowers grow in the spring and how {PERSON}'s mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden,"" but they do not provide any concrete evidence to back up this claim. A more effective analysis would have included specific details from the story to support their argument.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of patience, as they have provided a personal anecdote about their experience with patience. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and coherence in its structure and organization. The student jumps abruptly from describing the test to discussing their martial arts journey, which makes it challenging to follow the narrative.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts by stating that the mood created by the author is confusing, which is a valid observation. However, the student fails to provide concrete evidence from the memoir to support this claim. Instead, they mention various emotions such as happiness, pride, and sadness, but do not explain how these emotions contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. The student also makes a statement that the mood cannot be described due to the presence of multiple emotions, which is a vague and unconvincing argument. Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""too many times"" and ""are happyness,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's analysis is also hindered by a lack of specific references to the memoir, which makes it difficult to understand the context of their argument. For example, they mention Narciso Rodriguez's life, but do not provide any details or quotes from the memoir to support their claim. This lack of specificity makes it challenging to evaluate the student's understanding of the memoir and their ability to analyze the author's use of mood.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the story is not well-structured and lacks coherence. The narrative jumps abruptly from the princess being patient to her becoming impatient and then embarrassed. The transition between these emotions is not smooth, making it difficult to follow the story.

The princess's character development is also lacking. We are introduced to her as a ""nice princess,"" but her behavior in the story contradicts this description. She is portrayed as impatient and angry, which does not align with the initial characterization. This inconsistency makes it challenging to understand the princess's personality.

The use of language and vocabulary is also a concern. The essay contains several grammatical errors, such as ""she was taking a shower so @PERSON1 had to wait and be patient"" (subject-verb agreement error) and ""she was emmbarassed and humiliated"" (spelling error). Additionally, the sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making the writing seem flat.

The story also lacks a clear message or lesson about patience. The princess's experience is not used to illustrate the importance of patience, and the story ends abruptly without any resolution or reflection.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammar. The student has attempted to address the prompt by discussing the features of the setting that affect the cyclist, specifically the heat and the lack of water. However, the writing could benefit from more detailed explanations and supporting evidence from the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the heat as a significant feature of the setting that affects the cyclist. The student provides a clear example from the story, stating that ""the heat poured down on him, making it hard to cycle."" This shows that the student can analyze the story and identify relevant details. However, the student could have provided more context and explanation about how the heat specifically affected the cyclist's experience.

The student also mentions the lack of water as another feature that affected the cyclist. The student provides an example from the story, stating that the water was ""brown and hot,"" which made the cyclist not want to drink it. This example shows that the student can identify relevant details from the story, but the explanation could be more detailed and connected to the overall impact on the cyclist.

The student's writing could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as ""effects the cyclist"" instead of ""affects the cyclist"" and ""potentially could have killed him"" instead of ""could have potentially killed him."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The student has attempted to identify several obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, incorrect verb tenses, and a lack of supporting evidence from the excerpt.

One of the main issues with the essay is the use of incorrect verb tenses. The student switches between the present and past tenses, which creates confusion and makes the text difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""The obsticles the @CAPS1 faced In attempting to Allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 is that they needed a @CAPS3 enough cable so It cold @CAPS4 the Blimp, the passengers and any @CAPS5 weight"" should be rewritten in a consistent tense. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific information from the excerpt to support their claims.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. The use of run-on sentences and incorrect capitalization makes the text hard to read. For instance, the sentence ""Another obstacles was How could they @CAPS6 that with the power of the wind that High up In the Air"" should be broken down into two separate sentences for clarity.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles faced by the builders. While they mention several potential issues, they do not provide any evidence from the excerpt to support their claims. For example, the student states that ""If @CAPS7 @CAPS8 there would Be padestrans At the @CAPS9,"" but does not provide any context or explanation of what this means.

The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the main points, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is that it identifies the main obstacles as the danger posed by dirigibles, nature, and an existing law. The student provides relevant information from the excerpt to support these points, such as the use of hydrogen in most foreign dirigibles, the destruction of the Hindenburg, and the shifting winds on top of the building. This shows that the student has carefully read and analyzed the excerpt.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets up the main points and provides a thesis statement. The current introduction is a bit abrupt and does not effectively lead the reader into the main body of the essay.

Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles. For example, the student mentions that the law would make it illegal for ships to tie up to the building, but does not explain why this is a significant obstacle. Similarly, the student mentions that the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened, but does not explain why this is a problem.

The essay primarily consists of two brief examples, but they are not effectively connected to a clear thesis statement or a well-supported argument. The student's writing also shows a lack of attention to sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The student starts by stating the topic, but fails to provide a clear direction or argument. The essay meanders between two examples without providing a cohesive explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the student mentions that the ""flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" but does not explain how this change affects the cyclist's experience. Similarly, the mention of ""high deserts of California in June"" is not effectively connected to the rest of the essay.

The student also struggles with providing supporting evidence and analysis. When discussing the heat in California in June, the student resorts to stating the obvious (""its really hot and in June the'summer time' its very tiring""). This lack of analysis and depth in explanation makes the essay feel superficial and unconvincing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the author's use of sensory details, such as the ""Passionate Cuban Music"" and the ""aromas of the kitchen,"" which effectively convey the author's love for his culture and community.

There are several errors throughout the essay, such as ""I v'e been waiting,"" ""I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to go out my cat,"" and ""Metarorickly speaking."" These errors make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning and detract from the overall quality of the essay.

In terms of content, the writer does a good job of describing the situation and their feelings, but they could have provided more depth and analysis. For example, they could have explained why they were patient in this situation or how their patience was tested.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence. The writer fails to effectively explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and a lack of proper sentence structure. 

The student starts by mentioning the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" which seems unrelated to the prompt. The mention of Yosemite National Park is also unclear, as it is not specified how the park's features affect the cyclist. The writer then shifts to the cyclist's depleting water supply and extreme heat, but fails to connect these elements to the setting. The sentence ""He is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks coherence.

The writer could have provided more specific examples from the story to support their conclusion. For instance, if the story indeed takes place in Yosemite National Park, the writer could have described how the park's terrain, climate, or geographical features contribute to the cyclist's dehydration and dizziness. However, the essay does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but falls short in providing a clear and well-supported analysis. The student identifies the mood as ""happy"" but fails to provide sufficient evidence from the memoir to justify this claim. The student mentions that the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States in 1956 and were reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1 in 1970, but this information is presented as a series of disconnected facts rather than a cohesive argument about the mood.

The student also mentions that the family now has a bigger house and are grateful to live in the United States, but this information is not directly related to the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student seems to be confusing the family's circumstances with the mood of the memoir, which is not a valid connection.

To improve this essay, the student should focus on analyzing specific events, descriptions, or language used in the memoir to support their claim about the mood. For example, they could discuss how the author's use of vivid imagery, tone, or dialogue contributes to the overall mood of the memoir.

The student's essay presents a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from shelves due to offensiveness. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and observations to support their position, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by directly addressing the prompt and stating their opinion, which shows they understand the task and can articulate their thoughts.
2.  They provide a clear and concise thesis statement, ""You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to,"" which sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
3.  The writer uses relevant examples, such as people having the option to not read or look at something they find offensive, to support their argument.
4.  They emphasize the importance of individual freedom and the need to be strong in the face of negativity, which is a valuable life lesson.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas and sentences often feeling disconnected and lacking a logical flow.
2.  The writer relies heavily on simplistic statements and phrases, such as ""it's not fair"" and ""don't pay them no mind,"" which may not be as effective in convincing the reader.
3.  There is a lack of specific examples or evidence to support the writer's claims, making the argument feel somewhat superficial.
4.  The essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary, as well as more complex sentence structures.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that computers have many negative effects on people. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has effectively used transitional phrases to connect their ideas, such as ""There are many things going on in the cyber world,"" and ""Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers.""

The student has also provided specific examples to support their claims, including the dangers of meeting strangers online, the potential for exposure to harmful content, and the negative impact on physical health due to a sedentary lifestyle. These examples are relevant to the topic and help to strengthen the student's argument.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""many bad effects"" and ""not so great for people all the time"" are somewhat generic and could be replaced with more descriptive language. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity.

The student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is commendable, but there are some areas where the writing feels a bit disjointed. For example, the sentence ""people such @CAPS2 young children, pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all"" could be rephrased for better flow.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured argument in favor of the benefits of computers on society. The essay is written in a clear and concise manner, with a logical flow of ideas. However, there are several areas that require improvement to elevate the writing quality.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their argument. For instance, they mention the convenience of sending emails instead of physical letters, the use of video messaging sites like ooVoo for face-to-face contact, and the ease of accessing information through online resources. These examples effectively demonstrate the benefits of computers in communication and research.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""greaty"" instead of ""greatly,"" ""buisnoss"" instead of ""business,"" ""cominucate"" instead of ""communicate,"" and ""nessasarily"" instead of ""necessarily."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand in some places.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""the computer has a cure for that, too"" and ""Computers are like chocolate"" come across as simplistic and cliche. The student could have used more descriptive language to convey their ideas.

Furthermore, the student's argument could be strengthened by addressing the counterarguments presented in the prompt. While they acknowledge the concern about people spending too much time on computers, they do not provide a convincing counterargument to this point. A more nuanced discussion of this issue would have added depth to the essay.

Finally, the student's conclusion could be more effective if it were more concise and directly tied to the thesis statement. The current conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Strengths:
- The student has identified the key elements that contribute to the mood of love in the memoir, such as the author's love for family, community, and the values of friendship, trust, love, and caring.
- The student has provided specific quotes from the memoir to support their analysis, which is a good practice in academic writing.
- The student has demonstrated an understanding of the author's message about the importance of love and community.

Weaknesses:

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. They have identified two significant problems: the use of hydrogen in most foreign dirigibles, which poses a fire hazard, and the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, making it impossible for dirigibles to dock or refuel. However, the student's analysis could be more comprehensive and nuanced.

One area of improvement is the lack of specific details about the mooring mast itself and its intended purpose. The student mentions that the idea of a mooring mast ""quickly diminished from the citizens' imaginations,"" but does not explain why this was the case or how it relates to the obstacles faced by the builders. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, such as its origins or the specific regulations it imposed.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transitional phrases, making the text feel a bit disjointed. The use of quotes around the phrase ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" is a good attempt to incorporate direct evidence from the excerpt, but it could be more effectively integrated into the paragraph.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the height of the mooring mast (1,250 feet high) and the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which was a major safety concern due to its flammability. The student also mentions the accident involving the Hindenburg in New Jersey, which highlights the risks associated with dirigibles.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the essay. For example, the sentence ""As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area"" seems out of place and could be rephrased to better connect with the previous sentence.

Additionally, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, they mention the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, but they do not specify where this information comes from in the excerpt.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors, such as the use of ""swivelling"" instead of ""swaying"" and ""too"" instead of ""to."" The student also uses the phrase ""these were some of the obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1,"" which seems incomplete and could be rephrased to better conclude the essay.

They provide examples of how computers are used in various aspects of life, such as banking and employment. However, the student also acknowledges the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, including the risk of obesity and neglecting family relationships.

The student's writing shows some strengths, including the use of transitional phrases (""For instance,"" ""But"") and attempts to address counterarguments (""I do agree that people are becoming overweight""). However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, and the organization could be more logical and coherent. The student jumps between ideas, such as discussing the importance of computers, the issue of laziness, and the need for physical activity.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. The use of informal language and slang (""togeather,"" ""festy meter"") detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's personal anecdote about taking away their games and going outside is not well-integrated into the essay and feels like an afterthought.

To improve, the student should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement, organizing their ideas more logically, and editing their writing for grammar and mechanics. They should also strive to use more formal language and avoid relying on personal anecdotes as evidence.

The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student could have provided a clearer and more concise thesis statement at the beginning of the essay. The current introduction is somewhat vague and does not effectively set the tone for the rest of the essay. A stronger thesis statement would have helped to guide the reader through the essay and provided a clearer direction.

Secondly, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles mentioned in the excerpt. While the student has identified the obstacles, they could have delved deeper into the significance of each obstacle and how it affected the builders' plans. For example, the student mentions that the architects were worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure, but does not explain how this would impact the building's foundation.

Thirdly, the student could have improved the organization and coherence of the essay. The transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the ideas are not well-connected. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the load and wind pressure to the problem with foreign dirigibles. A clearer structure and more cohesive transitions would have made the essay easier to follow.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their writing lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar. The essay starts with a clear thesis statement, stating that the effects of computers on people are great, but the supporting arguments are not well-developed and lack concrete evidence.

One of the main issues with the essay is the use of informal language and slang, which is not suitable for a formal letter to a local newspaper. Phrases such as ""Dont you think so?"" and ""Thing about!"" are not professional and detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the use of abbreviations like ""ect."" is not acceptable in formal writing.

The student attempts to provide examples of the benefits of computers, such as chatting with friends and learning about the globe, but these points are not well-supported and lack specific details. The sentence ""You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows"" is unclear and confusing.

The student also makes some valid points about the safety benefits of computers, such as keeping children safe from harm by allowing them to stay at home and learn. However, these points are not developed fully and could be strengthened with more evidence and examples.

The phrase ""his legs and body needed a rest"" is a vague statement that doesn't provide a clear link between the setting and the cyclist's physical state. Furthermore, the writer mentions that the cyclist had to ""struggle"" to get to his destination, but this could be due to various factors, not necessarily the setting.

The writer also uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which makes it difficult to follow their train of thought. For instance, the sentence ""He was also restless but he did it"" is unclear and doesn't add any meaningful insight into how the setting affects the cyclist. The writer's use of phrases like ""he was a strong man"" and ""he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling"" comes across as more of a character description than a connection to the setting.

The writer could have benefited from providing more specific examples or details about the setting and how it impacted the cyclist's experience.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their writing requires improvement in several areas. One of the strengths of the essay is that the student attempts to provide both sides of the argument, acknowledging that some people might spend too much time on computers, but also highlighting the benefits of using them. However, the student's writing lacks coherence and clarity, making it challenging to follow their train of thought.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of organization. The student jumps between ideas without providing a clear structure or transitions between paragraphs. For instance, the student starts by stating that computers are a good thing to use, but then shifts to discussing the benefits of using a computer while multitasking. The student also struggles to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying on vague statements such as ""the effects computers have on people is good (for the most part).""

Another area for improvement is the student's use of language and grammar. There are several errors in punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the student uses phrases like ""The statement is true"" without providing any context or evidence to support the claim. Additionally, the student's use of words like ""multi propose"" and ""because they're of people"" is incorrect.

The student also struggles to address the counterargument effectively. While they acknowledge that some people might not be able to afford a computer, they fail to provide a convincing solution or suggestion for addressing this issue. The student's statement that ""if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft"" is unclear and confusing.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clear and coherent structure, providing concrete evidence to support their claims, and addressing the counterargument in a more effective manner.

For instance, the sentence ""When you go to the store and you see some thing you want and have mom or dad say they will git you for your brithbay then you can no wait for you bathbay then you can no wait for you birthday"" is confusing and contains several errors. The writer seems to be trying to convey the idea that waiting for a gift is a situation where patience is necessary, but the sentence is unclear and difficult to understand.

Another issue with the essay is the lack of supporting details. The writer mentions several situations where patience is necessary, but they do not provide any specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate these points. For instance, when discussing Christmas, the writer states that it is a time when you ""got almose everything you want,"" but they do not explain why this is a situation where patience is necessary.

The writer also struggles with using transitional phrases and connecting ideas between sentences. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing waiting in line to waiting for a gift to waiting for Christmas, without any clear connections between these ideas.

Despite these challenges, the writer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience and attempts to provide relevant examples. With more practice and attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation, the writer has the potential to produce a stronger essay.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their writing lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar. The essay starts with a clear thesis statement, stating that spending time on computers is a good thing. However, the student fails to provide a well-structured argument to support their claim.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of organization. The student jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically. For instance, the student starts by mentioning hand-eye coordination, then shifts to saving money, and finally talks about the convenience of computers. A more effective essay would have a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion that ties all the ideas together.

Another issue is the use of grammar and spelling errors. The student has several instances of misspelled words, such as ""corrdination"" instead of ""coordination,"" ""cach"" instead of ""catch,"" and ""anwway"" instead of ""anyway."" These errors make the essay difficult to read and understand.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and clarity. Many sentences are short and lack specific details to support the claims. For example, the sentence ""Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination"" is unclear and lacks a logical connection between the idea and the example.

Despite these challenges, the student shows some creativity in their writing, such as using a personal anecdote about looking for information in a book. However, this idea is not fully developed and could be used to create a stronger argument.

To improve, the student should focus on organizing their ideas, using proper grammar and spelling, and providing more specific details to support their claims. With practice and revision, the student has the potential to write a more effective and persuasive essay.

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect a cyclist. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting details to make a strong argument. The student only mentions two examples, hot desert and rain or snow, without providing specific examples from the essay to support their claims. The student also uses simple sentences and lacks transitional phrases to connect their ideas.

For instance, when discussing the hot desert, the student states, ""The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated."" This sentence is a good start, but it could be more effective if the student provided a specific example from the essay to illustrate this point. Unfortunately, the student does not provide any supporting evidence from the essay to back up their claims.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to help the reader visualize the setting and its effects on the cyclist. For example, instead of simply stating that the cyclist would be cold in the rain or snow, the student could describe how the rain or snow would make the road slippery or how the cold air would make the cyclist's muscles ache.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The writer effectively uses specific examples from their personal experiences with their grandma to illustrate the qualities of a patient person. The writer's use of sensory details, such as the frustration of frosting sugar cookies and the mess of baking, helps the reader visualize the situations and understand the writer's emotions.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more depth and analysis in their examples. For instance, they could have explained why their grandma's patience was particularly impressive or how it affected them. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay, such as ""I'm not the best listener"" and ""I would get very invoked."" The writer could benefit from more precise word choice and sentence structure.

The writer also struggles with transitions between paragraphs, making the essay feel a bit disjointed. For example, the transition from the frosting sugar cookies example to the carmel corn example is abrupt. A more cohesive connection between the ideas would strengthen the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have taken the opportunity to explore the concept of patience more deeply. While they provide examples of their grandma's patience, they don't delve into what patience means to them or how it has impacted their life.

The student also shows a good understanding of the author's purpose in ending the story with this paragraph, but their writing could benefit from more clarity and organization.

Score: 2

Reasoning:

* The student correctly identifies the main character's confidence boost and the flower's symbolism, stating that the flower ""gives her stength to try again."" However, they could have provided more specific examples from the story to support this claim, such as how the flower reminds the main character of her home in Vietnam and how this memory gives her the courage to retake the driving test.
* The student also mentions that the flower blooms in the spring and never stops blooming, but they don't fully explain how this relates to the main character's determination. A more detailed analysis would show how the flower's perpetual blooming serves as a reminder to the main character that she should not give up, just like the flower never stops blooming.
* The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. Some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, the sentence ""She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn’t either"" could be rephrased for better clarity.
* The student's use of transitions and connections between ideas could be improved.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay could be improved in terms of organization, coherence, and the use of specific details from the excerpt. The student has identified three main issues: the stress on the building's frame, the weight and wind pressure on the foundation, and the flammability of hydrogen. These points are relevant to the topic, but the student could have provided more specific information from the excerpt to support their claims.

For instance, the student mentions that the weight of the dirigible and wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation, but does not provide any specific details from the excerpt to back up this claim. Additionally, the student could have explained how the stress on the building's frame would affect the structure's stability or safety. The student's conclusion that the idea is ""neither practical or safe"" is a good summary of the main points, but could be more effective if it were supported by more specific evidence from the excerpt.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but could benefit from more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. The use of simple sentences and basic vocabulary is suitable for a middle school level, but the student could have used more descriptive language to make the essay more engaging.

Reasoning:

* The student correctly identifies the symbolism of the changing seasons and its connection to Saeng's growth, but their explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. For example, they state that ""the snow always melts when the seasons change,"" but they do not elaborate on how this relates to Saeng's emotional growth. A more detailed analysis would explore how the changing seasons serve as a metaphor for Saeng's transformation.
* The student also makes a good point about Saeng's appreciation for @CAPS1, but this idea could be further developed. For instance, they could explain how Saeng's experience with the hibiscus has given her a new perspective on life, and how this newfound appreciation will influence her future actions.
* The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks specific textual evidence to support their claims. For example, they state that ""Saeng will try again when the seasons change,"" but they do not provide any evidence from the text to support this claim. A more effective analysis would include quotes or specific details from the story to illustrate their points.
* The student's use of transitional phrases and sentence structure is good, but there are some areas where the writing could be more polished.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay effectively identifies three main challenges: the stress added to the building's frame, safety concerns, and the violent winds surrounding the mast. The student provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the amount of modifications made to the building (""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"") and the potential risks associated with dirigibles (""a potential fire or flying too low over urban areas"").

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the student could have provided more detailed analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have discussed how the stress added to the building's frame affected the structural integrity of the building or how the safety concerns impacted the builders' decisions. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the excerpt to support their claims, such as quotes or specific details about the violent winds.

Furthermore, the student's conclusion seems to shift focus from the obstacles faced by the builders to a critique of the builders' decision-making process. While this is an interesting point, it is not directly related to the prompt and could be seen as a tangent. The student could have stuck to the topic and provided a more focused conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the essay.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and well-structured argument in favor of allowing diverse materials to be available on library shelves. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their stance, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. 

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to acknowledge the complexity of individual tastes and preferences. The writer recognizes that people have different likes and interests, and that what one person finds disturbing or inappropriate might be interesting to another. This acknowledgment is crucial in the context of censorship, as it highlights the importance of allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they read.

The writer also effectively uses examples to support their argument. For instance, they distinguish between books that contain nude photos for educational purposes and those that are purely explicit. This distinction shows that the writer is capable of nuanced thinking and can differentiate between different types of content.

However, there are areas where the essay could be improved. The writing could benefit from more precise vocabulary and sentence structure. The writer often uses simple sentences and colloquial expressions, which, while understandable, detract from the overall clarity and sophistication of the writing. Additionally, some sentences are repetitive or worded awkwardly, which can make them difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more concrete evidence to support their arguments. While they mention the importance of freedom of speech and the value of diverse perspectives, they could provide more specific examples or statistics to illustrate the impact of censorship on individuals and society.

The writer effectively uses specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, demonstrating a good understanding of the content. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify and describe the obstacles faced by the builders. The writer mentions three main challenges: the stress a docked airship would place on the building, the harsh weather conditions at the top of the building, and the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled airships. The writer also provides relevant quotes from the excerpt to support their claims, which is a good practice.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles. For example, they could have explained how the stress on the building's foundation would affect its structural integrity or how the violent air currents would impact the airship's ability to dock. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the Hindenburg-type accident and its relevance to the builders' concerns.

The essay provided by {PERSON} attempts to express their stance on censorship in libraries, but it falls short in several areas. One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing books to music, and the transitions between ideas are not well-connected. This makes it challenging to follow the author's train of thought.

Furthermore, the essay relies heavily on simplistic and inaccurate statements. For instance, the claim that removing a book or music will lead to people yelling, becoming violent, and destroying stores is an overgeneralization. This type of statement can be misleading and lacks concrete evidence to support it. Additionally, the use of colloquial language, such as ""realy,"" ""mouney,"" and ""vilent,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

The essay also fails to provide a clear and well-supported argument. The author's main point is that we should not remove any movies, books, and music from the shelves, but they do not provide any substantial reasons or examples to back up this claim. The essay relies on vague statements and personal anecdotes that are not convincing.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with a logical progression of ideas. The student has effectively used specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, including the law prohibiting low-flying aircraft, the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and the impracticality of the mast design.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the relevance of each obstacle. For example, they note that the law prohibiting low-flying aircraft would make it impossible for dirigibles to dock, and that the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles would be catastrophic if an incident like the Hindenburg disaster were to occur in a densely populated city like New York. The student also effectively uses quotes from the excerpt to support their points, which adds credibility to their argument.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. At times, the student's writing can be a bit simplistic, and some of the sentences could be more complex and varied in structure. Additionally, the student could benefit from providing more analysis and explanation of the significance of each obstacle, rather than simply stating the facts. For example, they could discuss how the law prohibiting low-flying aircraft reflects the concerns of the time about air traffic safety, or how the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles highlight the importance of using helium instead.

The writer has provided several specific examples to support their argument, including personal anecdotes that make the essay more engaging and relatable.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and paragraphs. For instance, the writer uses phrases such as ""Another thing computers allow us to do"" and ""Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily"" to transition between paragraphs and ideas. This helps to create a clear flow of ideas and makes the essay easier to follow.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the benefits of computers, including their ability to improve hand-eye coordination, provide access to information, and facilitate communication. The writer provides specific examples, such as their sister's improvement in eye-hand coordination and their ability to video chat with their dad while he was away, to illustrate these points.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race"" to begin the essay, but could have used a more nuanced and specific phrase to express their opinion. Additionally, the writer could have provided more evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions, to make their argument more convincing.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing commas. For example, the writer writes ""Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before,"" but could have written ""Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they would not have been able to learn before"" to make the sentence more grammatically correct.

The writer's narrative is fragmented and difficult to follow due to the abundance of typos and incorrect word choices. For instance, the sentence ""we cold get a ner game game controller"" is unclear and should be rewritten as ""we could get a new game controller."" Similarly, the phrase ""riding was four about lommits"" is likely meant to convey a sense of waiting, but the word ""lommits"" is not a recognized term.

The writer also struggles to provide a clear and concise narrative. The essay jumps abruptly from one event to another, making it challenging to understand the sequence of events. For example, the writer states that they went swimming, but this activity is not connected to the main idea of the essay. Furthermore, the writer's use of the phrase ""we play with my dog macy"" seems out of place and does not contribute to the overall message about patience.

The writer attempts to conclude the essay by stating that ""the best we to be pashint is to keep your self okupid for along pereld."" However, this sentence is riddled with errors and is unclear.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details. For example, instead of saying ""it seemed like it was taking forever,"" the student could have described how they felt during that time, such as feeling anxious or restless. This would have helped the reader to better understand the student's emotions and experience.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay contains several errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The writer provides a personal anecdote about a time when their teacher, @CAPS7, showed patience and helped them understand a difficult concept in math. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to convey the situation, such as ""a worried expression on her face"" and ""fell silent for a moment."" This helps the reader visualize the scene and understand the writer's emotions.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more detail about the specific difficulties they faced with adding negative numbers and how @CAPS7 teacher's patience helped them overcome those challenges. Additionally, some sentences are quite short and lack variety in structure, which makes the writing seem a bit simplistic. For example, the sentence ""I was already lost"" could be rephrased to provide more context or detail.

The writer also uses some informal language, such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot,"" and ""dont"" instead of ""don't."" While this is not uncommon in middle school writing, it's essential to encourage students to use proper grammar and spelling.

The writer does a good job of showing respect for @CAPS7 teacher and acknowledging the importance of patience in their life. The conclusion effectively summarizes the experience and highlights the positive impact of @CAPS7 teacher's patience.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but falls short in providing a clear and detailed analysis. The writer starts by mentioning that the author was happy in some parts and sad in others, which is a vague statement that doesn't provide much insight into the author's emotional state. The writer also fails to provide specific examples from the memoir to support their claim, making it difficult to understand the context of the author's emotions.

The writer mentions that the author is happy because they can look back on memories, but this statement is not supported by any specific details from the memoir. It would have been helpful if the writer had provided a quote or a specific event from the memoir that illustrates this point.

Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""in some parts"" and ""in other parts"" is vague and doesn't provide a clear understanding of the author's mood. The writer could have benefited from providing more specific examples and quotes from the memoir to support their analysis.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, advocating for the preservation of books on shelves despite potential controversy. The essay effectively utilizes personal opinions, observations, and reading experiences to support the argument. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of organization, coherence, and sentence structure.

Strengths:

1.  The student presents a clear and concise thesis statement, ""So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways?"" This sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The student effectively uses personal opinions and experiences to support their argument, stating, ""Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about.""
3.  The student suggests a practical solution to the issue of categorizing books by genre, which demonstrates an understanding of the problem and a potential solution.
4.  The student effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the reader, such as ""If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library?""

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and logical structure, with ideas and supporting evidence presented in a somewhat disorganized manner.
2.  The student often uses simplistic sentence structures and vocabulary, which may make the writing seem less engaging and less polished.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a positive impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with three main points supporting the author's claim: learning about the world, teaching hand-eye coordination, and allowing people to meet new individuals online. The student provides specific examples to illustrate each point, which is a commendable effort.

However, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the student's writing is marred by numerous spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""hand eye cordination,"" ""puck,"" ""ncordination,"" and ""neet."" These mistakes detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it challenging to understand the author's intended message.

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be strengthened by providing more nuanced and detailed examples. For instance, while the idea of learning about the world is a good starting point, the student could have explored the potential consequences of relying on computers for information, such as the spread of misinformation or the loss of critical thinking skills.

Additionally, the student's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs is limited, making the essay feel somewhat disjointed. The author jumps abruptly from discussing hand-eye coordination to meeting new people online, without providing a clear link between the two ideas.

Lastly, the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and fails to summarize the main points effectively. The student could have rephrased the conclusion to provide a more satisfying ending to the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance against censorship in libraries, emphasizing the importance of freedom of choice in reading materials. The essay begins by posing a thought-provoking question about dwindling reading choices, which effectively grabs the reader's attention. However, the writing could benefit from a more cohesive and organized structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide personal opinions and experiences, making the argument more relatable and engaging. For instance, the statement ""As an avid reader of all kinds of literature I cant stand censorship"" effectively conveys the student's passion for reading and their opposition to censorship. Additionally, the student provides some valid points, such as the importance of exposing children to diverse ideas and perspectives through reading.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the writing lacks clarity and coherence, with some sentences being fragmented and difficult to follow. For example, the sentence ""The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Secondly, the student could have provided more concrete examples and evidence to support their arguments, making the essay more convincing and persuasive.

Furthermore, the student's use of language and grammar needs improvement. There are several errors in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4"" should be rewritten as ""Kids these days mainly use two kinds of media: the internet and @CAPS4.""

Lastly, the student could have explored more nuanced arguments and counterarguments to strengthen their position. For example, they could have discussed the potential consequences of unrestricted access to certain materials or the role of parental guidance in regulating children's media consumption.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the given passage. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the harsh desert environment, which is a key aspect of the setting. For instance, the phrase ""rough, dry and abandoned terrain"" effectively conveys the challenging conditions the cyclist faces. The use of sensory details such as ""the sun was beating on him"" and ""his sweat was drying in the heat"" helps the reader to imagine the cyclist's experience and understand the difficulties he encounters.

However, the writer could have provided more depth and analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist's journey. The passage mainly focuses on describing the setting rather than exploring its impact on the cyclist's emotions, thoughts, or actions. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and sentence structure issues that detract from the overall clarity of the writing.

The writer also uses some repetitive language, such as ""lifeless and dry"" which is used twice in the passage. This repetition makes the writing seem less polished and could be improved upon.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear thesis statement. The student provides several convincing arguments to support their position, including the idea that the definition of ""offensive"" is subjective and can vary from person to person, and that censorship would lead to a slippery slope where one person's opinion determines what others can and cannot read or access.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of examples to illustrate their points. For instance, the comparison between the National Geographic magazine and the @CAPS1 magazine is a good way to show how difficult it would be to determine what is and isn't offensive. The student also effectively uses the concept of the First Amendment to argue that people have the right to freedom of speech and press, and that censorship would infringe upon this right.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. The writing could be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors and more varied sentence structures. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and to the point. For example, the sentence ""We sometimes forget we have the ammendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press"" could be rephrased to ""We often forget that we have the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment.""

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and nuance to their arguments. For instance, they could have explored the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of minority voices or the stifling of creativity. They could have also addressed potential counterarguments, such as the idea that some materials may be so objectionable that they should be removed from the shelves.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of writing quality, coherence, and grammar. The student has attempted to tell a story about a personal experience related to patience, but the narrative is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The use of slang and informal language (""gonin crazy"", ""thaught"", ""yup"", ""dash"") detracts from the overall quality of the writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to convey their emotions and excitement when they finally receive their shoes. The use of descriptive language (""the best shoes known to man"") and action verbs (""run over"", ""pick it up"", ""tear it open"") helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several errors throughout the text, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words (""@ORGANIZATION1"" should be a specific organization, not a placeholder). Additionally, the student could have provided more context and details about their experience, such as how they felt when they were waiting for their shoes and what they learned from the experience.

The essay provides a good attempt at explaining how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure. 

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the hot desert environment as a challenging setting for the cyclist. The writer effectively uses the information that June is a hot part of the year and that the terrain changes into ""short rolling hills,"" which makes riding more difficult. This is evident in the sentence, ""The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement."" This demonstrates an understanding of the physical demands of cycling and how the setting affects the cyclist's experience.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to support the writer's claims. For instance, when discussing the road conditions, the writer mentions the ""Rough Road Affect"" sign, but fails to elaborate on how this affects the cyclist. A more detailed explanation of how the uneven pavement impacts the cyclist's journey would strengthen the argument.

Additionally, the writer could improve sentence structure and clarity by varying sentence length and using more precise vocabulary. Some sentences, such as ""Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving,"" are unclear and may be misinterpreted. A more precise sentence would be ""Most people wouldn't have the motivation to keep moving.""

Furthermore, the writer could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the physical environment to the cyclist's lack of goals and motivation. A clearer connection between these ideas would enhance the overall flow of the essay.

For instance, they could have described how the ""rolling hills"" and ""snakes"" in the setting made the character feel anxious or fearful, and how this affected their decision-making process.

The student's writing is also marred by simplistic sentence structures and a lack of descriptive language. For example, the sentence ""That's how the setting affected the character"" is a vague conclusion that doesn't provide any insight into the character's emotional or psychological state. To improve, the student could have used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the setting and its impact on the character.

Furthermore, the student could have explored the theme of the story more deeply, analyzing how the setting contributes to the character's emotional journey.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its writing. The student's use of language is informal, with several grammatical errors and misspellings. The essay's structure is also somewhat disorganized, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The student starts by mentioning a time when they were patient, but the story that follows is more about their experience at the dentist and doctor's office rather than a specific instance of patience. The student could have done a better job of connecting their experience to the concept of patience.

The student's writing also lacks descriptive language and sensory details, making it hard to visualize the scene. For example, instead of simply stating that they ""waited three hours,"" the student could have described what they did during that time, such as reading a book or chatting with family members.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is weak. The essay jumps abruptly from talking about waiting at the dentist to going to the doctor, and then to eating lunch. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect these ideas more smoothly.

However, the student does show some understanding of the concept of patience, as they mention that a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. This is a good starting point, and with more practice and attention to writing skills, the student could develop a stronger essay.

The inclusion of quotes from their mother emphasizes the significance of laughter in their family and provides insight into the writer's values.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesion and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas and stories without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow at times. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. The writer also relies heavily on the phrase ""my mom says"" or ""my mom believes,"" which could be rephrased for more varied sentence structure.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and straightforward argument against removing adult materials from library shelves. The writer's tone is informal and conversational, which may be suitable for a persuasive essay, but it also leads to some grammatical errors and a lack of sophistication in their writing style.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal anecdotes and hypothetical situations to support their argument. For example, when discussing how parents should handle their children discovering adult materials, the writer suggests that parents should simply take the materials away and tell their children that they are not ready for them. This approach shows that the student is thinking critically about the issue and considering different perspectives.

However, the essay also has several weaknesses. The writing is often simplistic and lacks depth, with the student relying on vague statements such as ""they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways"" and ""what's the big deal?"" These statements do not provide any concrete evidence or analysis to support the student's argument.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between different ideas and examples without fully developing each point. For example, the student starts by arguing that children will learn about adult materials regardless of whether they are available in libraries, but then shifts to discussing how parents should handle their children discovering adult materials. A clearer structure and more transitional phrases would help to make the essay flow better.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay is marred by numerous errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and poor punctuation.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks coherence and clarity in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer starts by mentioning a woman who listened to older men, but this seems unrelated to the main topic of the essay. The writer then shifts to a personal experience of seeing a snake and tumbleweeds, which is a good attempt to connect the setting to the cyclist. However, the connection between the setting and the cyclist's experience is not explicitly stated.

The writer mentions that the woman started to see things that weren't there, which could be a result of the setting's features, such as the heat or the isolation. However, this is not clearly explained. The writer also fails to provide a clear thesis statement or a cohesive argument, making it difficult to follow the essay's main point.

The writer's use of descriptive language, such as ""ridiculously large snake"" and ""diamondback,"" is a good attempt to engage the reader, but it is not effectively used to support the main argument. The writer also uses informal language, such as ""really did look like,"" which may not be suitable for a formal essay.

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The writer starts by mentioning a personal experience of being patient when wanting something badly, but fails to provide a specific example or details. The statement ""But that is not the only way to @CAPS1 patient you have too @CAPS1 patient in church and in the doctors office so there are many way to @CAPS1 patient"" is confusing and seems to be a jumbled collection of thoughts. The writer appears to be trying to make a point about patience in different settings, but the connection between the ideas is unclear.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling. The use of ""@CAPS1"" instead of ""patient"" is inconsistent and seems to be a formatting error. Additionally, the sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making the essay feel flat and unengaging.

The writer attempts to address the prompt, but the essay lacks depth and insight into the concept of patience. To improve, the writer could provide a specific example of a time when they were patient, and explain how they felt and what they learned from the experience.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The writer effectively conveys the sense of happiness and togetherness that pervades the narrative. However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed analysis of the text to support the writer's claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to capture the reader's emotional response to the memoir. The writer's use of phrases such as ""makes you feel like you were there"" and ""you wish and hope that you could have a life like that"" effectively convey the sense of longing and aspiration that the author evokes in the reader. Additionally, the writer's observation that the neighborhood is ""one big family"" and that the older people are referred to as ""grandparents"" highlights the strong sense of community and family that is present in the memoir.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific textual evidence to support the writer's claims. For example, the writer states that the author ""makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live,"" but does not provide any specific examples from the text to support this claim. Additionally, the writer's statement that the author ""makes you think about your family and all they do for you"" could be more effectively supported with specific examples from the text.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level writing. Some of the sentences are wordy and could be broken up for greater clarity. For example, the sentence ""He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other"" could be broken up into two separate sentences for greater clarity.

Evaluation: The student's response is a good start, but it lacks depth and clarity in explaining why the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph. The student only mentions the reason for the author's conclusion, but fails to provide supporting evidence from the story.

The student states that the author wants to come back and smell the test again when the snow melts and the geese return. However, this is not the primary reason for the author's conclusion. The paragraph is more about Saeng's vow to herself to take the test again in the spring, when nature is in full bloom, rather than just smelling the test.

A more accurate interpretation would be that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to convey Saeng's sense of hope and determination. The image of the hibiscus budding in the spring, accompanied by the return of the geese, creates a sense of renewal and new beginnings. This is in contrast to the bleak and isolated atmosphere of the story, where Saeng is taking the test in a desolate and snowy landscape. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author is suggesting that Saeng will have another chance to prove herself, and that the cycle of life will continue.

The student could have supported their answer by referencing specific details from the story, such as the contrast between the snowy landscape and the budding hibiscus, or the symbolism of the geese returning. This would have made their response more convincing and engaging.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has attempted to address the question of obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The student has provided some relevant information from the excerpt, but the connections between the information and the question are not always clear.

One of the main strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify specific challenges faced by the builders, such as the mast not being ready and the landing gear not being sure to work. However, the student could have provided more context and explanation for these challenges. For example, the student mentions that the idea of using dirigibles over a crowded area was not ""even said to be relevantly smart,"" but does not explain what this means or how it relates to the builders' decisions.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and clarity. Some sentences are worded awkwardly, and the use of phrases like ""the builders had many problems to face"" is a bit generic.

However, the essay could benefit from more depth and detail in the examples provided. The writer also uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary, which is typical for a middle school level writer.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to identify and describe their mother's patient behavior in different situations. The writer also demonstrates an understanding of the concept of patience, which is to be understanding and tolerant. However, the writer could have provided more insight into why they think their mother is patient, rather than just stating it as a fact.

The writer's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, which makes the essay feel a bit disjointed at times.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, as it highlights a personal experience where the writer had to wait for a long time to ride a space coaster at {CAPS1}. The writer's initial disappointment and subsequent decision to wait again the next day show a growth in patience. However, the writing could be improved in several areas.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to tell a relatable story that connects to the prompt. The writer effectively uses descriptive language, such as ""something cool, space {CAPS2}"" and ""hours that seemed like years,"" to engage the reader. Additionally, the writer's use of personal experience and emotions makes the story more authentic and interesting.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer's writing style is simple and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many sentences are short and lack descriptive details. For example, the sentence ""My mom was shocked so we left"" could be rephrased to provide more context and description. The writer also uses informal language and slang, such as ""disapointed"" and ""fastoas,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

The essay effectively conveys the importance of laughter in the writer's life, particularly during a difficult time in their childhood. The writer's personal experience of feeling isolated and alone after their parents' divorce is vividly described, and the introduction of the new neighbor kid and his laughter serves as a turning point in the narrative. The writer's use of sensory details, such as the sound of the kid's laughter and the feeling of happiness it brought, helps to create a relatable and engaging story.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's emotions and thoughts in a clear and concise manner. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I was empty"" and ""I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill"" effectively convey their emotional state and the impact of the new neighbor's laughter on their life. The writer also does a good job of showing, not telling, through the use of descriptive language and sensory details.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as many of the sentences are simple and lack complexity. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the writer could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas.

The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation at times, with errors such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. While these errors do not detract from the overall message of the essay, they do make it more difficult to read and understand.

In terms of content, the writer could benefit from more depth and analysis of the theme of laughter.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and well-structured argument, showcasing their ability to think critically about the issue. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their stance, making the essay relatable and engaging. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

Strengths:

1.  The writer begins by asking rhetorical questions that grab the reader's attention and encourage them to consider the issue of censorship in libraries. This technique effectively engages the reader and sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The writer provides a clear and concise thesis statement, stating that they believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, but only if they meet specific criteria (sexist, racist, excessive sex, or gruesome content).
3.  The writer uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, making the essay more relatable and engaging.
4.  The writer quotes a relevant author, Katherine Paterson, to add credibility to their argument and emphasize the importance of considering the potential consequences of censorship.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer's writing style is often informal and conversational, which may detract from the essay's overall credibility. For example, the use of phrases like ""Lets get out of here"" and ""wack"" may not be suitable for a persuasive essay.
2.  The writer's argument could be more nuanced and well-supported. While they provide some valid points, they also make sweeping statements that may not be entirely accurate (e.g., ""People use curse words like they do the words 'and' or 'the'"").
3.  The writer's proposed solution to censorship, which involves separating books into different sections based on age and content, may not be practical or effective. This system could lead to confusion and make it difficult for readers to find the books they want.
4.  The writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. For example, instead of saying ""I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western,"" the writer could say ""I believe that books with mature themes, such as romance and westerns, should be shelved in a separate section for adults.""

The student has attempted to provide a personal anecdote about a time when they were patient, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks detail. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and informal language.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify a situation where they remained calm and composed, even when their peers were misbehaving. This shows that they have a basic understanding of what it means to be patient. However, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and a clearer structure.

These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

In terms of coherence, the essay jumps abruptly from describing the chaotic scene in the classroom to the student's thoughts about getting in trouble and being suspended. A clearer transition between these ideas would help to create a more cohesive narrative.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer has a personal and relatable story to share, which is a strength. However, the writing could benefit from more clarity, coherence, and attention to grammar and punctuation.

One of the main issues is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The writer jumps directly into the story without setting up a clear argument or claim. A stronger introduction would help to guide the reader through the essay and provide a clear direction.

The writer also struggles with transitions between paragraphs, which makes the essay feel disjointed at times. For example, the transition from discussing the importance of laughter to the specific story about the writer's experience feels abrupt. Adding transitional phrases or sentences can help to connect the ideas and make the essay flow better.

In terms of content, the writer does a good job of sharing a personal story, but some parts of the narrative feel disconnected or unclear. For instance, the writer mentions being on a soccer team and having a relationship with someone, but it's not entirely clear how these events relate to the main point about laughter. Providing more context or explanation can help to clarify the connections between these events.

The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation, which can make the essay difficult to follow at times. For example, there are several instances of missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. Proofreading and editing can help to improve the clarity and coherence of the writing.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. While the writer uses some good descriptive language, such as ""astonishing thing"" and ""scariest and worst day of my life,"" there are also many instances of simple or generic words and phrases. Using more descriptive language can help to add depth and interest to the writing.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more thorough and accurate. They correctly identify Saeng's determination and her decision to wait until spring to take the driving test, but their explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks specific details from the story. The student also makes a few errors in their interpretation, such as stating that Saeng wants to ""plant her difficulties"" in a location, which is not supported by the text.

Score: 2

Reasoning: 

The student's essay shows a good effort in understanding the story's conclusion, but there are areas for improvement. Firstly, the student correctly identifies Saeng's determination and her decision to wait until spring to take the driving test. This is evident in the final paragraph of the story, where Saeng vows to herself to take the test again in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. However, the student's explanation could be more thorough and accurate. For instance, they state that Saeng wants to ""plant her difficulties"" in a location, which is not supported by the text. Instead, Saeng plants the hibiscus flower, which serves as a symbol of her homeland and a reminder of her determination.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific details from the story to support their analysis. For example, they could have mentioned how Saeng's family moved from Vietnam and how she misses the flowers she sees in her new life. This would have provided a clearer understanding of Saeng's motivations and emotions, and how they relate to the story's conclusion.

Overall, the student's essay demonstrates a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but could benefit from more thorough analysis and accurate interpretation of the text.",2

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The student has provided a personal anecdote about a time when they were patient, which is in line with the prompt. However, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherence in some sentences.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to describe a specific situation where they had to be patient. The story is relatable, and the student's emotions and actions are well-conveyed. The use of dialogue adds a touch of realism to the narrative. The student also attempts to explain the concept of patience and its importance.

However, the essay is plagued by numerous errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing"" is a run-on sentence that lacks proper punctuation. Similarly, the sentence ""I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed"" contains a spelling error and an unnecessary use of @CAPS3.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and coherence. Some sentences are fragmented, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For example, the sentence ""I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”"" is a jarring transition that disrupts the flow of the narrative.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks descriptive language and sensory details. While the story is relatable, it is not engaging or vivid. The student could have used more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the scene.

The student's response attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and clarity. The student states that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader what happens, which is a vague and generic explanation. The student does not provide any specific details or examples from the story to support their claim. 

A more effective response would have analyzed the significance of the paragraph in relation to the rest of the story. For instance, the student could have discussed how the paragraph provides a sense of closure and resolution for the protagonist, Saeng, after her experience. They could have also explored how the image of the hibiscus budding in the spring serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, which is a recurring theme in the story.

Furthermore, the student's response could have benefited from more precise language and sentence structure. The use of phrases like ""he is telling how the story ends"" and ""so people know's what happens"" is informal and lacks clarity.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the argument. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, as seen in the quote from paragraph @NUM1. This shows that the student has made an effort to engage with the source material. However, the quote is not properly referenced, and the student should be encouraged to use proper citation techniques.

Secondly, the student has identified three main obstacles: safety concerns due to the flammability of helium, high winds making it unsafe for dirigibles, and pre-existing laws restricting low-flying aircraft. These points are relevant and well-explained, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.

However, the student could improve by providing more detail and analysis of each point. For example, they could explain how the flammability of helium posed a specific risk to the city, or how the pre-existing laws were a significant challenge for the builders. Additionally, the student could have explored alternative solutions that the builders might have considered to overcome these obstacles.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, making the essay feel a bit flat. The student could also work on using transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has demonstrated a good attempt to address the prompt, but their writing requires improvement in several areas. The essay lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar, which makes it challenging to understand the writer's ideas. The student has identified the features of the setting, such as the desert, sun, and abandoned towns, and their effects on the cyclist. However, the writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and simplistic sentence structures.

For instance, the sentence ""The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot"" is unclear and contains a misspelling of the word ""desert."" The student could have used more precise language to convey their ideas. Additionally, the sentence ""The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks coherence.

The student has attempted to analyze the mood of the story, but their explanation is brief and lacks depth. They mention that the mood shifts from content to sad to happy, but do not provide sufficient evidence from the text to support this claim. For example, when discussing the abandoned towns, the student states that they ""make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite."" This sentence contains several grammatical errors and lacks clarity.

The essay provided is a personal narrative that attempts to convey the writer's struggles with balancing school, work, and family responsibilities. The writer's tone is informal and conversational, which may be suitable for a personal reflection but not ideal for a formal essay. The writer's use of slang and colloquial expressions, such as ""pertty,"" ""greads,"" and ""hade,"" detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to express their emotions and thoughts in a sincere and relatable way. The writer's love and concern for their mother are evident throughout the essay, and their desire to help her is admirable. However, the writer's writing style and grammar are often inconsistent, which makes it difficult to follow their train of thought at times.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between ideas is also lacking. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing their mother's situation to their own struggles with school and work. A more cohesive and logical structure would have improved the overall flow of the essay.

In terms of content, the writer provides some specific details about their situation, such as their job at a fast-food place and their desire to find a better job. However, these details are not fully developed, and the writer could have provided more context and analysis to make their points more convincing.

The writer's use of language is also a concern. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. These errors detract from the writer's credibility and make it difficult to take their writing seriously.

The writer seems to be trying to convey that the weather affects a cyclist's mood, but the explanation is vague and lacks specific examples. The sentence structure is also simplistic, with a lack of transitional phrases and cohesive connections between ideas.

The student starts by stating that the weather has a significant impact on a cyclist, but the explanation is incomplete and lacks supporting evidence. The writer mentions that bad weather makes a person tired and upset, which is a reasonable point, but fails to elaborate on how this affects a cyclist specifically. The sentence ""and easy to angre"" is unclear and may be a typo or a grammatical error.

The writer also fails to provide any concrete examples from the essay to support their conclusion. The statement ""so now it make you upset and and then stress"" is a non-sequitur and does not logically follow from the previous sentence.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story ""Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit."" The writer effectively uses specific examples from the story to support their conclusion. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the setting as a crucial factor in determining the cyclist's mood. The writer correctly points out that the hot weather in California's high deserts affects the cyclist's need for water, which becomes a conflict in the story. The use of quotes from the story, such as ""The sun [began] to beat down"" and ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine,"" effectively illustrates the impact of the setting on the cyclist's attitude and determination.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed analysis of the setting's effects on the cyclist. For instance, the writer could explore how the desolate landscape of the high deserts contributes to the cyclist's feelings of isolation and vulnerability. Additionally, the writer could discuss how the setting influences the cyclist's interactions with the old men, such as their advice and the cyclist's initial gratitude.

In terms of grammar and spelling, the essay contains several errors, including ""detirmined"" instead of ""determined,"" ""detirmination"" instead of ""determination,"" and ""negitive"" instead of ""negative.""

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples of how computers benefit society, such as socializing, education, and business. The writer effectively uses transitional phrases, like ""Also"" and ""What,"" to connect ideas and make the text more cohesive.

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""benifit,"" ""easir,"" and ""buisnesses.""

The student has attempted to address the prompt by discussing the impact of the setting on the cyclist. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and specific examples to support the claims made. The writer jumps between different aspects of the setting, such as the roughness of the ride, the distance from towns, and the availability of water, without providing a clear connection between these elements and how they affect the cyclist.

For instance, when discussing the roughness of the ride, the writer mentions that the tire could ""poys,"" which seems to be a typo and unclear. A more precise example would have been helpful to illustrate this point. Additionally, the writer fails to explain how the smoothness of the ride would affect the cyclist, which is an interesting point but not fully developed.

The writer also touches on the idea that the setting could be far away from towns, making it difficult to get back. This is a valid concern, but the writer does not provide any specific details or examples to support this claim. Furthermore, the writer mentions dehydration as a potential consequence of a lack of water, but does not explain how this would specifically affect the cyclist.

Firstly, the student has provided some relevant examples from the story to support their conclusion, such as the dehydration and the encounter with the poisonous snake. For instance, the quote ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June"" effectively illustrates the negative impact of dehydration on the cyclist. 

However, the student's writing is marred by several grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""de hydration"" instead of ""dehydration,"" ""affect"" used incorrectly in some places, and ""don't ask direction"" instead of ""ask for directions."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between ideas are not smooth, and the essay lacks a clear structure. The student jumps abruptly from discussing dehydration to mentioning the poisonous snake, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. Additionally, some of the sentences are incomplete or lack coherence, such as ""A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride."" The correct term should be ""effect,"" not ""affect,"" and the sentence could be rephrased for better clarity.

Lastly, the student could benefit from more detailed analysis and explanation of the effects of the setting on the cyclist. For example, the student could explore how the heat of the day in June contributed to the cyclist's dehydration or how the presence of the poisonous snake affected the cyclist's emotional state.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its response. The writer seems to be discussing the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, but the information provided is not directly related to the prompt. The main focus of the essay is on the competition with the Chrysler building and the intention behind the mooring mast, which is not directly connected to the docking of dirigibles.

The writer mentions that the mooring mast was created for publicity, but this is not supported by any evidence from the excerpt. The statement ""Because about the mooring mast the building would have failed to become popular"" is unclear and does not make sense in the context of the essay. The writer also fails to provide any specific information about the obstacles faced by the builders in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

The writer does mention that Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State Building, made the building seem ""invincible,"" but this statement is not supported by any evidence from the excerpt. The writer also fails to provide any information about the actual obstacles faced by the builders in relation to dirigibles docking.

The essay also contains several grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its,"" ""suppost"" instead of ""supposed,"" and ""surve"" instead of ""serve."" The writer also fails to provide a clear and concise thesis statement that addresses the prompt.

Evaluation: 
The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it could be improved with more detailed analysis and supporting evidence. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the text to illustrate the cyclist's emotional state, such as the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" and the bleakness of the desert setting with only a Welch's Grape Juice Factory in sight. However, the writer could have explored these examples more thoroughly to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotions.

One area of improvement is the writer's transition between ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's despair to comparing the cyclist's situation to that of people trapped in a blizzard. A smoother transition would help the reader follow the writer's train of thought and strengthen the connection between the ideas.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more analysis of the symbolism in the text. For instance, the mention of pebbles in the cyclist's mouth and the song ""rattling around in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain"" could be explored further to reveal their significance in the context of the story.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that the final paragraph shows Saeng's determination to adapt to her new home, but they fail to provide a clear connection between the last sentence and the rest of the story. The mention of the sentence ""@NUM1at-"" is unclear, as it seems to be a misplaced or incorrect reference. The student also uses the pronoun ""he"" to refer to the author, which is incorrect since the story is written from a third-person perspective.

The student's analysis is also somewhat simplistic, as they state that Saeng has ""decided to move on with life and no longer be sad."" While this is true, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of Saeng's emotions and the author's message. The student could have explored how Saeng's decision to take the test again in the spring represents a turning point in her emotional journey and a sign of her growth.

The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and concise argument, but it falls short in several areas that are crucial for effective writing at the middle school level. The writer's main point is that censorship restricts freedom of speech and stifles self-expression. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting evidence to make the argument more convincing.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The writer uses informal language, such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""peopole"" instead of ""people."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times. Additionally, the writer fails to use proper capitalization, as seen in the sentence ""Its all a matter of opinion.""

The essay also lacks specific examples and supporting details to strengthen the argument. The writer relies heavily on general statements, such as ""With censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion."" This statement is vague and does not provide concrete evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, the writer fails to address potential counterarguments, which is an essential aspect of persuasive writing.

The writer's use of quotes is also underutilized. The provided quote from Katherine Paterson is relevant to the topic, but it is not effectively integrated into the essay. The writer could have used the quote to support their argument and provide a more nuanced perspective on censorship.

In terms of organization, the essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer jumps directly into the topic without providing a clear thesis statement or transitioning between ideas. The essay also lacks a clear conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis.

Evaluation: 
The essay attempts to address the prompt about patience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer starts by acknowledging the difficulty of being patient, especially when dealing with little kids. However, the tone quickly shifts to a negative one, expressing frustration and annoyance towards the cousin. This is evident in phrases such as ""get on my nervers,"" ""dumb questions,"" and ""stupid things."" This tone undermines the overall message about patience and tolerance.

The writer also struggles to provide a clear and coherent narrative. The essay jumps between different ideas, making it hard to follow. For instance, the writer mentions visiting their cousin at an organization, but the purpose of the visit is unclear. The writer's feelings towards their cousin are also inconsistent, initially expressing dislike but later suggesting the possibility of becoming friends in the future.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is informal and contains grammatical errors. Phrases like ""especilly"" and ""I don't like her at all"" are not suitable for formal writing. The writer also uses the phrase ""right, I don't think so,"" which is more suitable for casual conversation than an essay.

The writer attempts to address the prompt, but the essay lacks depth and coherence. To improve, the writer should focus on providing a clear and consistent narrative, using formal language, and maintaining a positive tone.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that books and other materials should not be removed from the shelves. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear thesis statement. The student provides several examples to support their position, including the idea that authors and artists have the right to create content, and that individuals should be able to make their own choices about what they read or listen to.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use specific examples to illustrate their points. For instance, the comparison between slavery being a historical event that may offend some people but is still important to learn about is a good example of how censorship can be problematic. The student also effectively addresses potential counterarguments, such as the idea that parents or individuals may be offended by certain materials, by suggesting that it is their responsibility to make informed choices about what they allow their children to read or listen to.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. Additionally, the student could have provided more nuanced and detailed analysis of the topic, rather than relying on simple statements and examples. For instance, the student could have explored the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of free speech and the limitation of access to information.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more evidence to support their claims, such as quotes from authors or experts on the topic, or statistics on the impact of censorship on libraries and communities. The student also could have addressed potential counterarguments more thoroughly, such as the idea that some materials may be harmful or objectionable to certain groups.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a science fiction narrative. However, the execution falls short in several areas. Firstly, the story lacks coherence and clarity, making it challenging to follow the plot. The use of abbreviations and acronyms, such as ""@ORGANIZATION1,"" ""@ORGANIZATION2,"" and ""@CAPS1,"" is confusing and detracts from the overall understanding of the story. 

Furthermore, the writing lacks descriptive language and sensory details, which are essential for engaging the reader. The narrative relies heavily on action-oriented phrases, such as ""beat the crud out of them,"" which, although conveying a sense of intensity, do not contribute to the development of the story.

The essay also fails to explicitly connect the story to the concept of patience, which is the primary focus of the prompt. While the narrative does depict a character, @CAPS3, who ultimately saves the day, it does not demonstrate the qualities of patience that the prompt emphasizes.

The writing also contains grammatical errors, such as the use of ""they were to strong"" instead of ""they were too strong."" Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, which makes the writing seem immature.

The student's use of vocabulary, such as ""diffucult"" and ""depressing,"" is not precise, and their sentence structure is simplistic.

The student mentions that the mood is ""difficult"" and ""depressing"" due to the challenges of adapting to a new culture and language in the United States.

The writer mentions that it took an hour for their sister to get in, but they do not elaborate on how they felt during this time. The use of phrases such as ""it was a long day"" and ""the day was pretty much over with then"" is vague and does not provide a clear picture of the writer's experience.

Furthermore, the writer does not explicitly explain how their sister's patience was demonstrated in the situation.

The writer lists several examples of obstacles encountered by the cyclist, such as following bad advice, encountering a tarlike substance, navigating short rolling hills, and dealing with tumble weeds and a large snake. However, the writer fails to provide a cohesive explanation of how these features specifically affect the cyclist.

For instance, the writer states that the terrain changed to ""short, rolling hills"" which ""wasnt helping, her bike better."" This sentence is unclear and does not effectively convey how the terrain affects the cyclist. It would be more effective to explain how the rolling hills made the bike harder to ride or caused the cyclist to lose speed.

Additionally, the writer could have provided more detail about the cyclist's emotional or physical state in response to these obstacles. For example, how did the cyclist feel when she encountered the tarlike substance or the snake? How did these experiences impact her overall journey?

Furthermore, the writer could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and its effects on the cyclist.

The writer effectively uses specific examples from the text to support their conclusion, demonstrating a good understanding of the story. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure, vocabulary, and depth of analysis.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the emotional impact of the setting on the cyclist. The writer correctly notes that the cyclist feels despair when surrounded by the desolate landscape, but also highlights the renewal of hope when the cyclist thinks of the ""cool pines and rushing rivers."" This shows a good understanding of the emotional arc of the story.

However, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. For example, the sentence ""That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope"" feels like a conclusion tacked on at the end, rather than a natural culmination of the ideas presented.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from using more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting. While the writer mentions the ""desolate landscape,"" they could elaborate on what this looks like and how it makes the cyclist feel. This would help the reader to better understand the emotional impact of the setting.

Finally, the writer could delve deeper into the symbolism of the setting and its connection to the cyclist's emotional state.

The writer fails to provide a clear and logical connection between the setting and its impact on the cyclist. The essay also contains grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect verb tenses, which hinder the reader's understanding.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of specific examples from the setting that support the writer's conclusion. The writer mentions that the cyclist knows he's in the wrong area, but it's unclear what features of the setting led him to this realization. The writer also fails to explain how the setting affects the cyclist's emotions and actions, making the essay feel disconnected and superficial.

For instance, the writer states that the cyclist ""had a feeling that he wasn’t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn’t have let them take a peek at his map."" However, this sentence is unclear and doesn’t provide any concrete evidence of how the setting affects the cyclist. The writer could have provided more details about the setting, such as the terrain, weather, or time of day, to support their claim.

Furthermore, the writer's use of phrases such as ""he was upset and new he should have taken his advise"" suggests a lack of attention to grammar and spelling.

The transitions between ideas are not smooth, and the student jumps between different points without connecting them effectively. Additionally, the student could benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to express their ideas.

The student's use of quotes from the memoir is a good start, but they could be used more effectively to support their analysis. For example, the student mentions that the author says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives,"" but they do not explain how this quote contributes to the mood of the story. Similarly, the student mentions that the author says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done,"" but they do not analyze how this quote reveals the author's feelings towards their parents.

To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed analysis of the quotes and the text as a whole. They should also work on organizing their ideas more effectively and using more sophisticated vocabulary to express their thoughts.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen in foreign-made blimps, the risks associated with hydrogen, and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the safety risks associated with hydrogen-filled dirigibles. The student correctly cites the excerpt that most blimps made outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and provides a specific example of a disastrous accident in 1937. Additionally, the student explains how the winds atop the Empire State Building would cause the blimp's tail end to swing, making it difficult to dock safely.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the safety risks to mentioning the city's law concerning low-flying airships. The student could have transitioned more smoothly between ideas to make the essay flow better.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more analysis and depth to the information. For example, the student could have explained why the city's law concerning low-flying airships was a significant obstacle or how the builders of the Empire State Building could have mitigated the risks associated with hydrogen-filled dirigibles.

Lastly, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and grammar. For instance, the sentence ""Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock"" should be ""Many apparent obstacles were overlooked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock"" to correct the spelling error.

Evaluation: 
The essay attempts to address the prompt about patience, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and coherent narrative. The writer starts by mentioning a visit to the ""great wolf loge"" but fails to provide any context or details about the experience. The main event of the story, a child's accident in the pool, is mentioned briefly, but it is not developed further. The writer also fails to explain how this experience relates to the concept of patience.

Furthermore, the writing lacks descriptive language and vivid details. The phrase ""some kid poop in the pool"" is a simplistic and immature way to describe the incident, and the description of the pool as ""brown"" is not sufficient to convey the impact of the situation. The writer also fails to provide any emotional depth or reflection on the experience.

The essay also lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The sentence structure is simple and lacks variety, making it difficult to follow. The writer uses basic vocabulary and fails to use transitional phrases or connecting words to link ideas together.

However, the writer attempts to address the prompt by mentioning that they had to wait for three hours, which is a good example of a situation that requires patience. The writer also mentions that they went outside and played in a pool, which could be seen as a positive outcome of the situation.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in writing about patience, but there are several areas that need improvement. The essay starts off strong by introducing the concept of patience and its relation to understanding and tolerance. However, the student's personal experience with patience is not effectively conveyed throughout the essay.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from describing the situation to expressing frustration and anger. The transitions between ideas are not smooth, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the student starts by saying they were patient, but then immediately shifts to describing a situation where they were not patient at all.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and informal language. The use of slang words like ""man,"" ""freaking out,"" and ""probly"" detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's writing lacks descriptive language and vivid details, making it hard to visualize the scene.

The student does attempt to make a point about the importance of patience, but it is not well-supported. The conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main idea. The student's personal experience is not used effectively to illustrate the concept of patience.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more detailed and supported by specific examples from the text. They correctly identify the connection between the beginning and the end of the story, but their explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. Additionally, their interpretation of the significance of the plants in the story is accurate, but could be further developed with more textual evidence.

Score: 2

Reasoning: 

The student's response shows a basic understanding of the story's conclusion, as they recognize the connection between the beginning and the end. They mention that the author ends the story similarly to how it started, which is a valid observation. However, their explanation could be more detailed and supported by specific examples from the text. For instance, they could have mentioned that the story begins with Saeng looking at the hibiscus and the geese, and that this image is repeated at the end, creating a sense of circularity and closure.

Furthermore, the student's interpretation of the significance of the plants in the story is accurate, but could be further developed with more textual evidence. They mention that the plants give Saeng a sense of comfort during hard times, but they could have supported this claim with specific examples from the story, such as Saeng's vow to return to the hibiscus in the spring, which suggests that the plant has provided her with a sense of hope and renewal.

To improve their response, the student could have provided more specific and detailed analysis of the story, supported by textual evidence. They could have also explored the themes and symbolism of the story in more depth, such as the idea of renewal and the cyclical nature of life.",2

Evaluation:
The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt, as they have identified the moods created by the author in the memoir. However, their analysis could be more effective with more specific and detailed examples from the text. 

The student correctly identifies the friendly and compassionate moods in the excerpt, but their explanation is somewhat vague and lacks concrete evidence from the text. For instance, when discussing the friendly mood, they mention that the neighborhood was a ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants,"" but they do not provide specific details from the text to support this claim. Similarly, when discussing the compassionate mood, they mention that Narciso's parents showed compassion to families in need, but they do not provide a specific quote or example from the text to illustrate this point.

The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of their writing. For example, they use the word ""friendlyness"" instead of ""friendliness,"" and they have several grammatical errors throughout the essay.

The student's writing also lacks depth and analysis. They simply state that the author leaves a ""grateful mood"" without providing any specific evidence from the text to support this claim. Additionally, they do not provide any analysis of how the author's use of language or literary devices contributes to the mood.

Evaluation:

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has presented a well-structured argument on the topic of censorship in libraries. The essay begins with a relatable scenario, which effectively grabs the reader's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's personal experience of encountering an adult book with a nude woman on the cover at a public library serves as a compelling example to support their argument.

However, the essay could benefit from more development and refinement in several areas. Firstly, the student's thesis statement is somewhat unclear and could be more explicitly stated. The student argues that libraries should not remove books or movies but rather reorganize them to prevent children from accessing them. This point could be more clearly articulated and supported with more evidence.

Additionally, the student's use of language and grammar needs improvement. There are several errors in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling throughout the essay. For instance, the student uses '@CAPS1' and '@CAPS2' instead of proper capitalization, and there are missing articles and verb tenses that are not consistent. These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's supporting arguments could be more nuanced and well-developed. While the student mentions rating books and movies like movies, this idea is not fully explored or explained. The student could have provided more examples or evidence to support this suggestion.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis. The current conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and does not leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Evaluation:
The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, as defined in the prompt. The writer effectively uses a creative and engaging narrative to illustrate the importance of patience in a spy mission. The story is well-structured, and the writer's use of descriptive language helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use humor and satire to convey the idea that patience is not always easy, but it is necessary. The writer's use of phrases such as ""I'm just about to abort the mission"" and ""I think to myself that if I'm able to defeat twelve armed robbers with nothing but a tablecloth, I'm sure I can sit here and just be patient"" shows a good sense of humor and creativity.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The writer's writing style is often informal and conversational, which may not be suitable for a formal essay. There are also some grammatical errors and typos throughout the essay, such as ""wat"" instead of ""what,"" ""bay"" instead of ""buy,"" and ""diaped"" instead of ""wore."" Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow.

In terms of content, the writer does a good job of illustrating the concept of patience, but the story could be more cohesive and focused. At times, the writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, the transition from the writer's boredom on the bench to the discovery of the computer chip feels a bit abrupt.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing concerns about the excessive use of technology and its potential negative effects on individuals. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas, sometimes making it challenging to follow their train of thought.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide personal anecdotes, such as the experience with their cousins at their aunt's house, to support their argument. This adds a relatable element to the essay and helps the reader understand the writer's perspective.

On the other hand, the essay lacks depth and analysis. The writer mentions various negative effects of excessive technology use, such as addiction, harm to the computer, and health issues, but does not provide sufficient evidence or explanation to support these claims. Additionally, the writer fails to address the positive effects of technology, such as improved hand-eye coordination and access to information, in a more substantial manner.

The writing also contains several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation issues, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, ""their is"" should be ""there is,"" ""to much"" should be ""too much,"" and ""eh"" should be ""the.""

To improve, the student should focus on organizing their ideas more effectively, providing more evidence to support their claims, and addressing both sides of the argument. They should also work on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

For example, the sentence ""This describes Saeng’s position perfectly – she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear and logical connection between the setting and the cyclist's experience. The essay relies heavily on vague statements and lacks specific examples to support its claims.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer starts by stating that the feature of the setting affects the cyclist, but does not provide a clear explanation of how this happens. The writer then jumps to examples without connecting them to the initial statement. For instance, the writer states that the surrounding environment is perceived negatively, but does not explain why this is the case or how it affects the cyclist.

The writer also uses simplistic and clichéd phrases, such as ""everything seems harder than it really is"" and ""his attitude would change and everything would seem easier."" These phrases do not provide any new insights or depth to the essay. Furthermore, the writer fails to provide specific examples from the text to support their claims. For example, when discussing the empty setting, the writer states that ""nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature,"" but does not explain how these specific features of the setting affect the cyclist.

The writer also uses the phrase ""no living he around him,"" which is grammatically incorrect and unclear. It is unclear what the writer means by ""no living he around him."" Is the writer referring to the lack of people around the cyclist, or is there something else at play?

To improve this essay, the writer needs to provide a clear and logical explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples from the text to support the writer's conclusion. For instance, the writer effectively uses the example of the old timers at the reservoir campground to illustrate how their advice led the cyclist to take a shortcut that almost resulted in a fatal accident. The writer also uses vivid descriptions, such as ""the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate,"" to paint a picture of the harsh climate the cyclist is facing.

However, the essay suffers from several issues. Firstly, the writer's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as ""nd"" instead of ""and"" and ""yoth"" instead of ""both."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. Additionally, the writer's transitions between paragraphs are not smooth, and the essay could benefit from more cohesive linking words and phrases to connect the ideas.

Furthermore, the writer's analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist is somewhat superficial. While the writer mentions the heat and dehydration as major problems, they do not delve deeper into the psychological or emotional effects of the setting on the cyclist. For example, how does the isolation of the high desert affect the cyclist's mental state? How does the harsh climate impact the cyclist's mood and motivation?

The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their argument. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and effectiveness.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by acknowledging the potential impact of certain books on children, which sets the tone for their argument. This shows an understanding of the issue and its relevance to their audience.
2.  The writer uses personal anecdotes, such as their mother's concerns about their activities, to illustrate the importance of parental involvement in monitoring children's exposure to potentially harmful content.
3.  The essay includes a clear call to action, encouraging parents to preview media before allowing their children to consume it and to discuss what is right and wrong with their children.

Weaknesses:

1.  The writing lacks a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the student's argument at times. A more explicit statement of their position on censorship would help guide the reader through the essay.
2.  Transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt, disrupting the flow of the essay. The writer jumps between ideas without connecting them effectively, making it hard to follow their train of thought.
3.  The use of colloquial expressions and slang (""ect.,"" ""ect.,"" ""cyer space"") detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay. While it's understandable for middle school students to use informal language, it's essential to maintain a level of formality in academic writing.
4.  The writer relies heavily on general statements and assumptions, such as ""these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now."" This type of statement lacks concrete evidence and makes the argument less convincing.
5.  The conclusion feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay, as it reiterates the importance of parental involvement without tying it back to the initial argument about censorship.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Develop a clear thesis statement that outlines the student's position on censorship in libraries.
2.  Use transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs and improve the flow of the essay.
3.  Edit the essay to eliminate colloquial expressions and slang, replacing them with more formal language.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries demonstrates a clear attempt to express their opinion on the topic, but it falls short in several areas. One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The student's thoughts are disjointed, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the sentence ""I think that everyone has there own opinon in what they listen to,what they watch, and what they read"" is a good starting point, but it is followed by a confusing statement ""I belive that the some stuff can change out of the world."" The use of ""there"" instead of ""their"" and ""belive"" instead of ""believe"" also indicates a need for improvement in grammar and spelling.

Another issue is the lack of supporting evidence and logical reasoning. The student mentions that ""everything is offensive to at least one person,"" which is a valid point, but it is not developed further. The student also fails to provide concrete examples or specific instances where censorship is necessary. The statement ""getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble"" is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what the student means by ""weak-minded people.""

The student's writing also lacks depth and nuance. The idea that ""we can change what we see or hear and change the world"" is an oversimplification of a complex issue. The student fails to consider the potential consequences of censorship, such as limiting access to information and stifling free speech.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. They have identified two main challenges: weight and nature. The student provides specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, which is a strong aspect of their essay.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The transition between the two obstacles (weight and nature) feels abrupt, and the student could have provided a clearer explanation of how these obstacles relate to each other. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the information from the excerpt, rather than simply stating it.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors. For example, the sentence ""The story it says"" is unclear and could be rephrased. The student also uses the phrase ""the story says"" multiple times, which could be varied to improve the writing.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific examples and references to relevant information from the excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen by foreign dirigibles and the existing law preventing dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. However, the essay could benefit from more detailed explanations and analysis of these obstacles.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify and describe the problems faced by the builders, such as the flammability of hydrogen and the existing law. The student also provides a specific example of the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, the Los Angeles, which was unable to dock due to forceful winds. This shows that the student has a good understanding of the content and can apply it to the prompt.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more depth and analysis of the obstacles. For example, the student could explain why the builders were concerned about the use of hydrogen and how the existing law affected the docking of dirigibles. Additionally, the student could provide more evidence from the excerpt to support their claims.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the writing seem a bit flat. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as the use of ""for this project"" which is not necessary and ""due to forceful winds"" which could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student has made an attempt to analyze the author's intention behind concluding the story with the given paragraph. However, their reasoning is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They correctly identify the connection between the natural world and Saeng's situation but fail to fully explore the symbolism and themes present in the story.

The student's argument that Saeng's mother is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance is not entirely supported by the text. While the mother does mention the plant's ability to withstand the cold months, this statement is more about the plant's resilience than a message to Saeng. The student also fails to consider other possible interpretations of the story's conclusion, such as the idea that Saeng is drawing inspiration from the natural world to find hope and determination.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks specific textual evidence to support their claims. They could have benefited from providing more quotes or examples from the story to strengthen their argument.

Evaluation: The student's response attempts to address the prompt but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The student's statement is somewhat vague and doesn't provide specific evidence from the story to support their claim. The student's conclusion that the author wants to show the ""lone Saeng had for the geese"" is not clearly connected to the content of the story.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay fails to effectively explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The student mentions two features: lack of water and changed surroundings, but does not provide a clear connection between these features and their impact on the cyclist. The student also misinterprets the information from the text, stating that the pump gave water that tastes like battery acid, which is not supported by the original text. Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things"" and ""he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid."" The student also fails to provide a clear conclusion, instead stating that the cyclist had to have determination to find someone to say that he could survive, which is not directly related to the features of the setting.

The student's writing also lacks specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion. For instance, when discussing the changed surroundings, the student mentions that the old men said something, but does not provide a clear quote or explanation of what was said.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal anecdote, but it faces several challenges in terms of coherence, grammar, and sentence structure. The writer's enthusiasm and excitement about receiving a long-awaited item are evident, but the narrative is marred by numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise sentences. Many of the sentences are fragmented or run-on, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For instance, the sentence ""As I quickly went thought the order into I was thinking '@CAPS2 is will be so am some once I get @CAPS2.'"" is unclear and lacks proper grammar. Similarly, the sentence ""I took the long buss ride home. @CAPS3 got off waiting when it would come."" is a run-on sentence that disrupts the flow of the narrative.

The writer also struggles with spelling and capitalization. Words like ""plently,"" ""coal,"" and ""buck"" are misspelled, and proper nouns like ""@CAPS1,"" ""@CAPS2,"" ""@CAPS3,"" and ""@CAPS4"" are not capitalized correctly. These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

Despite these challenges, the writer attempts to convey the concept of patience through the narrative.

The student has attempted to address the prompt by identifying two contrasting emotions, sadness and happiness, as the mood of the memoir. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student fails to provide specific evidence from the memoir to support their claims, making it challenging to understand the context behind their assertions. The use of phrases such as ""some what"" and ""were immergrants"" also indicates a need for improvement in grammar and spelling.

The student's understanding of the concept of mood is evident, but their ability to apply it to the memoir is limited. They fail to consider the author's use of language, tone, and other literary devices that contribute to the overall mood of the story. Furthermore, the student's conclusion is brief and lacks clarity, making it difficult to fully grasp their argument.

The essay provided demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, the writing quality is hindered by several issues related to grammar, spelling, and coherence. 

One of the primary concerns is the lack of proper grammar and spelling throughout the essay. The writer frequently uses incorrect verb tenses, misspells words, and fails to use punctuation correctly. For instance, the sentence ""I not agreed the people shuld d in the computer a lot"" should be rewritten as ""I do not agree that people should spend a lot of time on computers."" This correction would improve the clarity and readability of the essay.

Another issue is the lack of coherence and logical flow. The writer jumps between different ideas without connecting them effectively. For example, the transition from discussing the potential consequences of excessive computer use on relationships to the impact on children's social lives feels abrupt. A more cohesive structure would help the reader follow the writer's argument more easily.

Furthermore, the writer's reasons for opposing excessive computer use are not well-supported and lack concrete evidence. The statement ""if you are a @NUM1 old man or your not going to d wit your kids and you going to have eyes problem"" is unclear and does not provide a logical connection between computer use and eye problems. Similarly, the claim that talking to other women online will lead to problems with one's wife is a sweeping generalization that is not supported by evidence.

The writer's final reason for opposing excessive computer use, that it prevents kids from having fun and making friends, is a valid concern. However, it is not well-developed and could be strengthened with more specific examples or evidence.

To improve this essay, the writer should focus on revising the grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors, as well as developing more coherent and well-supported arguments. With practice and attention to these areas, the writer can produce a more effective and persuasive essay.

The writer provides specific examples from the text to support their claims, which is a strong aspect of this essay. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

One of the strengths of this essay is the writer's ability to identify how the setting impacts the cyclist's emotions. For instance, when the cyclist encounters the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes, the writer correctly notes that the cyclist feels dismayed and hopeless, as evident from the quote ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows that the writer has a good understanding of the story's themes and can analyze the setting's effect on the character.

However, the writer could improve the essay by providing more detailed explanations and connections between the setting and the cyclist's emotions. For example, when discussing the first town, the writer states that the cyclist gains a ""boost of confidence,"" but does not elaborate on why this is the case. Additionally, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the shed to the rolling hills, making the essay feel a bit disjointed.

Furthermore, there are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more nuanced arguments and counterarguments to strengthen their position. While they acknowledge that some people might be concerned about the negative effects of computers, they do not fully address these concerns or provide evidence to refute them. This would have added depth and complexity to the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir, but their analysis is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They have identified the emotions of happiness and gratitude as the primary mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez. However, their supporting evidence is mostly based on isolated quotes and phrases without a clear connection to the overall narrative. The student's reliance on a flowchart to organize their thoughts is a good attempt to structure their analysis, but it is not effectively utilized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mood.

The student's use of the phrase ""happines"" instead of ""happiness"" and ""joy"" instead of ""gratitude"" suggests a lack of attention to detail and consistency in their writing. Additionally, the student's statement that the author ""shows happiness by showing @CAPS1 wanted nothing more that to be with his family doing the things @CAPS1 loved"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The student's recognition of the author's gratitude towards their parents is a positive aspect of their analysis, as it demonstrates an understanding of the author's emotional tone. However, the student could have delved deeper into the significance of the author's gratitude and how it contributes to the overall mood of the memoir.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a concise and focused response. However, there are areas where the student's analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific evidence from the memoir. 

The student correctly identifies the mood as gratitude, which is a strong starting point. They also provide specific examples from the text to support their claim, such as the author's parents leaving behind their careers and families to provide a better life for their child. These examples are relevant and help to illustrate the author's gratitude.

However, the student could have delved deeper into the text to provide more nuanced analysis. For instance, they could have explored how the author's experiences and emotions are conveyed through descriptive language or how the author's relationships with their parents are portrayed. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the memoir and its themes to better situate their analysis.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect their ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the essay. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. 

The student has provided three examples from the essay to support their conclusion, which is a good approach to demonstrate their understanding. The examples are taken from the essay ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and effectively illustrate how the setting impacts the cyclist's mood and ability. For instance, the student mentions the refreshing nature and cool air in the first example, which made the cyclist feel confident and energized. This is a good observation, as it shows how the setting can positively influence the cyclist's emotions and performance.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more precise language and sentence structure. In the second example, the sentence ""there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. The student should strive to use more precise vocabulary and correct grammatical structures to convey their ideas effectively.

Furthermore, the student's transitions between paragraphs and ideas could be smoother. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the first example to the second, and the connection between the two is not explicitly stated. The student should work on using transitional phrases and sentences to link their ideas together more coherently.

Additionally, the student's conclusion could be more concise and effectively summarize the main points. The final sentence, ""Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability,"" feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay and could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay provides a clear understanding of the concept of patience, but it could be improved in several areas. The writer has attempted to provide a relatable example of patience by using a common scenario of wanting a new toy. However, the explanation of patience is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The writer fails to provide a clear definition of patience and instead focuses on the consequences of not being patient. The essay also lacks proper sentence structure and grammar, which makes it difficult to follow at times.

The writer attempts to use a personal anecdote, but it is unclear whether the scenario is based on personal experience or hypothetical. The use of the phrase ""your mom and dad can't afford it right now"" suggests that the writer may be using a hypothetical situation. Additionally, the writer's use of the phrase ""your moms side"" is grammatically incorrect and should be ""your mom's side.""

The writer also fails to provide a clear connection between the example and the concept of patience.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the benefits of computers in society. The writer provides several examples of how computers can be helpful, such as accessing information for trips, staying in touch with friends, and completing school and work tasks. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's use of specific examples to support their claims. For instance, the writer explains how computers can help with traveling by providing information on prices and romantic spots. Similarly, the writer highlights the convenience of using computers to communicate with friends and access necessary documents. These examples demonstrate a good understanding of the topic and show the writer's ability to think critically about the benefits of computers.

However, the essay could be improved by addressing the opposing viewpoint. The writer only presents their own opinion without acknowledging potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, such as decreased physical activity and social isolation. This omission makes the essay feel one-sided and less convincing.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is informal and lacks polish. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and awkward sentence structures. The writer also relies heavily on vague phrases, such as ""helps out a bunch"" and ""will benefit our society or make our society,"" which detract from the overall clarity of the argument.

The student correctly identifies the test as a metaphor for the changing of the seasons, but fails to provide supporting evidence from the story to back up this claim. The student's response is also brief and lacks specific details, making it difficult to fully understand their thought process.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas.

Firstly, the student could have provided more details about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The essay only mentions that it is against the law, but does not explain the reasoning behind this law or its implications for the builders. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the obstacles faced by the builders, rather than simply listing them.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the prompt and has provided a well-structured argument in favor of not removing materials from libraries due to censorship concerns. The essay begins by highlighting the importance of books, music, and movies, and how removing one item can lead to a domino effect, leaving the library shelves almost empty. This is a strong opening statement that grabs the reader's attention.

The student also effectively addresses the role of parents in supervising their children and making decisions about what materials they have access to. The mention of library cards and the different types of cards available is a good point, as it shows that libraries already have measures in place to restrict access to certain materials based on age and parental discretion.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the arguments. For instance, the student could have provided examples of books or movies that have been challenged or banned in the past and how these decisions have affected the community. Additionally, the student could have explored the concept of censorship in more depth, discussing the potential consequences of removing materials from libraries and the impact on free speech and intellectual freedom.

The sentence structure is also simplistic, and the language is not descriptive. For instance, the phrase ""the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel"" is vague and does not provide any concrete evidence from the essay to support this claim.

The writer could have benefited from providing more details about the setting and how it affects the cyclist. For example, if the essay discussed a hilly terrain, the writer could have explained how the hills would impact the cyclist's pace and speed. Similarly, if the essay mentioned a windy or rainy environment, the writer could have discussed how these conditions would affect the cyclist's performance.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. They have identified two significant challenges: the safety risks associated with hydrogen-filled dirigibles and the unpredictable weather conditions, particularly the shifting winds on the building. The student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their claims, such as the use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles and the violent air currents affecting the winds.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the paragraph. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis and depth in their explanation of the obstacles. For example, they could have explored the potential consequences of a dirigible fire or the impact of the wind on the building's design.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors, such as the use of ""challenged"" instead of ""challenge"" and ""all in all"" instead of ""all things considered."" The student could also benefit from more varied sentence structures and a more sophisticated writing style.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the stress added to the building's frame by a thousand-foot dirigible and the danger posed by violent air currents. However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles, as the essay feels somewhat superficial.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify and explain the technical challenges faced by the builders, such as the stress on the building's frame and the swiveling of the dirigible's back around the mooring mast. The student also mentions the legal obstacle posed by the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which shows an understanding of the broader context.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and cohesion. The transitions between ideas are not always clear, and the student jumps abruptly from discussing the building's frame to the law against airships. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the significance of these obstacles and how they impacted the builders' efforts.

Furthermore, the student could have taken advantage of more specific details from the excerpt to support their points. For example, they could have mentioned the specific wind speeds or directions that made the air currents violent, or the exact wording of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks depth and specificity in its analysis of the memoir's mood. The writer identifies multiple moods present in the memoir but fails to provide concrete evidence from the text to support their claims. The statement that the author is trying to create a ""no place like home mood"" is not supported by any specific details from the memoir. Furthermore, the writer's assertion that the mood is ""calm and relaxing"" is a general statement that could apply to many texts, rather than a nuanced analysis of the memoir's unique atmosphere.

The writer's conclusion that the author is creating a specific mood is not adequately supported by textual evidence, and the analysis relies heavily on vague statements. To improve, the writer should focus on providing specific examples from the memoir to illustrate the mood and support their claims with textual evidence.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, arguing that censorship is a necessary measure to protect children from exposure to mature content. The writer effectively uses personal experience and observations to support their position, acknowledging the prevalence of media in various settings and the concerns of parents regarding their children's exposure to certain materials.

Strengths:

1.  The student begins by establishing a relatable context, mentioning the widespread availability of media and the importance of parental concerns. This helps to engage the reader and sets the stage for the argument.
2.  The writer effectively uses examples of potentially objectionable content, such as nudity, violence, and profanity, to illustrate the need for censorship.
3.  The student proposes a practical solution, suggesting that libraries and other media outlets categorize materials by age group, making it easier for parents to make informed choices.
4.  The writer's tone is clear and concise, making it easy to follow their argument.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear thesis statement, which would provide a more focused and concise summary of the writer's position.
2.  The writer relies heavily on personal opinion and does not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. While personal experience is valuable, it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples or research to strengthen the argument.
3.  The essay could benefit from more varied sentence structure and vocabulary. Many sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, making the writing seem somewhat flat.
4.  The writer's conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points or reiterate the thesis.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in a story, but their execution and analysis are somewhat limited. They have attempted to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but their response lacks depth and specificity. The student has identified some positive aspects of the mood, such as the loving relationship between the family and their friends, but they have not provided enough evidence from the text to support their claims.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""oppertunitie"" instead of ""opportunity,"" ""poopy"" instead of ""poor,"" and ""at lest"" instead of ""at least."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended meaning.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the mood is not well-supported by textual evidence. They mention that the family has food on the table, but they do not explain how this contributes to the mood of the story. They also mention that moving to the United States was a ""step down,"" but they do not provide any evidence from the text to support this claim.

To improve their analysis, the student should focus on providing more specific and detailed evidence from the text to support their claims about the mood. They should also work on correcting their grammatical errors and using more precise language to convey their ideas.

The writer effectively uses a narrative to convey the idea that patience involves being understanding and tolerant in the face of difficulties. The story is engaging and easy to follow, with a clear structure that builds up to a satisfying conclusion.

Strengths:

* The writer effectively uses descriptive language to set the scene, such as ""bright sunny day"" and ""riot going on.""
* The story is well-organized, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
* The writer uses the character of the young boy to illustrate the concept of patience, making it relatable and easy to understand.
* The writer effectively uses transitions to connect the different parts of the story, such as ""Now it has to be five hours"" and ""Now there was only fifteen people left.""

Weaknesses:

* The writing is simple and lacks variety in sentence structure. Many of the sentences are short and basic, which makes the text feel a bit flat.
* There are some grammatical errors, such as ""begain"" instead of ""began"" and ""towared"" instead of ""toward.""
* The writer could have provided more detail about the character of the young boy and his motivations for being patient.
* The story feels a bit rushed, with some events happening quickly without much explanation.

Suggestions for improvement:

The student has attempted to address the prompt by presenting their opinion on the effects of computers on society. However, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure, making it challenging to follow the student's argument. The writing is primarily composed of short sentences, which can make the text appear fragmented and difficult to read.

The student raises several valid concerns about the negative effects of computers, such as cyberbullying, addiction, and the impact on physical health. However, the essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support these claims. For instance, the student mentions that ""many"" people have lost their lives due to cyberbullying, but fails to provide any concrete statistics or personal anecdotes to illustrate this point.

The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are numerous errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, the student writes ""obesity"" instead of ""obesity"" and ""harrased"" instead of ""harassed.""

Furthermore, the student's conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear call to action. The final sentence, ""Everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on,"" is an extreme and unrealistic solution to the problems associated with computers.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims, and editing their writing for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors.

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it deviates from the expected topic of patience. Instead, the writer shares a story about their experience of being impatient while working to save money for hunting gear. Although the writer does touch on the idea of overcoming impatience, the narrative primarily focuses on their frustration and the outcome of their efforts rather than the development of patience.

The writer's writing skills are evident in their ability to create a clear and coherent narrative. However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the writer fails to explicitly connect their story to the concept of patience. The essay would benefit from a more direct link between the writer's experience and the definition of patience provided in the prompt.

Additionally, the writer's use of language and grammar is not always accurate. For instance, the sentence ""I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday"" should be ""I found myself becoming more impatient every day."" Furthermore, the writer uses colloquial expressions such as ""make money"" and ""by a three hundred dollar bow,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and organization. Some sentences are short and lack detail, while others are long and convoluted. For example, the sentence ""I was tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it"" could be broken down into separate sentences for better clarity.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not provide a clear reflection on what they learned from their experience. A more effective conclusion would summarize the writer's growth and how it relates to the concept of patience.

For instance, they could have discussed how a sunny day might boost the cyclist's mood and energy levels, making them more likely to ride, or how a rainy day might make the cyclist feel lethargic and less inclined to ride.

The student has identified a few examples from the story where the setting impacts the cyclist's emotions, but the explanations are brief and do not provide a clear connection between the setting and the cyclist's emotional responses.

For instance, when the student mentions that the speed limit sign makes the cyclist feel like life is cruel, it is not entirely clear why this is the case. Is it the speed limit itself, or the fact that the cyclist is being forced to slow down? The student does not provide enough context to support this claim. Similarly, when the cyclist sees the Welch's Juice factory, the student states that he feels excited, but does not explain why this is the case. Is it the sight of the factory itself, or the fact that it represents a destination or a goal?

The student also mentions that the deserted fork in the road makes the cyclist feel troubled, but again, does not provide enough context to support this claim. What specifically about the deserted fork in the road causes the cyclist to feel troubled? Is it the uncertainty of which path to take, or the feeling of being alone?

Finally, when the cyclist finally arrives at his destination, the student states that he feels relieved, but does not explain why this is the case. Is it the sense of accomplishment, or the fact that he has finally reached his goal?

The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and observations to support their argument, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis, relying heavily on simplistic and binary thinking.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to engage with the prompt and provide concrete examples to support the writer's claims. The use of specific scenarios, such as a child accessing an inappropriate movie or magazine, effectively illustrates the potential consequences of uncensored materials in libraries. The writer also demonstrates a clear understanding of the impact of media on children, stating that ""children are influenced by the things they see.""

However, the essay falls short in several areas. Firstly, the writer's argument relies heavily on a simplistic ""good vs. evil"" dichotomy, failing to consider the complexities of censorship and the potential consequences of restricting access to information. The writer's assertion that ""everything in the library should be censored"" oversimplifies the issue and neglects the importance of intellectual freedom and the role of libraries as a hub for diverse perspectives and ideas.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often simplistic and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other things for entertainment"" could be rephrased for greater clarity and sophistication. Additionally, the writer's use of sentence structure and punctuation is sometimes awkward, leading to sentences that are difficult to follow.

In terms of organization, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction and conclusion. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing movies to magazines to music, and the essay lacks a clear thesis statement that ties the various points together.

For instance, the sentence ""I get @CAPS3 I just cant wait! @CAPS10 its @CAPS2 first time what do you expect!"" is grammatically incorrect and difficult to decipher. The writer's use of slang and abbreviations also makes it hard to comprehend the narrative.

Furthermore, the essay fails to effectively illustrate the concept of patience. The writer's impatience is evident throughout the story, and the character's behavior is not a good example of patience. The writer's excitement and frustration are palpable, but they do not demonstrate the understanding and tolerance that patience entails.

The writer's use of descriptive language is limited, and the story lacks sensory details that would help the reader visualize the scene. The writer's reliance on abbreviations and informal language also makes it difficult to create a vivid image in the reader's mind.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on using proper grammar and punctuation, varying sentence structure, and incorporating more descriptive language. They should also strive to create a more coherent narrative that effectively illustrates the concept of patience.

The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of patience, but the student's personal experiences and anecdotes are somewhat contradictory to the definition provided in the prompt. The student claims to be impatient in various situations, which seems to contradict the idea of being patient. However, the student does mention a few instances where they can be patient, such as waiting for school to start and waiting for their mom to tell them to clean their room.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples from their personal life. However, the writing could benefit from more coherence and organization. The transitions between ideas are not smooth, and the essay jumps abruptly from one topic to another. Additionally, the student's writing lacks descriptive language and vivid details, making the essay feel somewhat flat.

The student's use of grammar and mechanics is generally good, but there are some errors in punctuation and capitalization. For example, the sentence ""The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start"" should be ""The only time I can be patient is when I am waiting for school to start."" The use of slang and informal language, such as ""im"" instead of ""I am,"" also detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

To improve, the student could work on providing more cohesive and well-organized writing, using more descriptive language, and avoiding errors in grammar and mechanics. They could also consider providing more examples that align with the definition of patience provided in the prompt.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of coherence, organization, and sentence structure. The writer attempts to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the transitions between ideas are not smooth, and some sentences lack clarity. 

The writer starts by mentioning the cyclist's excitement about the setting of Yosemite park, citing the ""cool pines and rushing rivers"" as the reason for his excitement. This is a good start, as it shows the writer's ability to identify the positive aspect of the setting. However, the writer then shifts to the cyclist's desperation for water, which is not directly connected to the initial idea. A clearer transition between the two ideas would have made the essay flow better.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure, as seen in the sentence ""He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. 'I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.'"" The use of a comma to separate the two independent clauses makes the sentence confusing. A more effective way to write this sentence would be to use a semicolon or a period to separate the two clauses.

Furthermore, the writer's use of quotes is not always effective. The quote ""sometimes life can be so cruel"" seems out of place and does not add much to the essay. The writer could have paraphrased this idea to make it more concise and relevant to the essay.

Despite these issues, the writer shows some potential in identifying the emotional impact of the setting on the cyclist. The writer recognizes that the setting can evoke feelings of excitement, desperation, and self-pity. However, the writer could have explored these ideas more thoroughly and provided more specific examples to support their claims.

The essay presents a clear and well-structured argument against censorship in libraries, particularly in the context of books. The writer effectively uses examples from their own experience and observations to support their position. One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to address the counterarguments presented by conservative groups who advocate for the removal of certain books from school libraries. The writer skillfully highlights the hypocrisy of censorship, pointing out that even if books are removed from school libraries, children will still find ways to access them.

The writer also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of freedom of speech and its importance in a democratic society. They effectively use the example of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech, press, and religion, to argue that censorship is a violation of authors' rights.

However, there are some areas where the essay could be improved. At times, the writer's tone comes across as somewhat confrontational, which may alienate readers who hold different opinions on the issue. Additionally, the writer could have provided more nuanced and balanced arguments to address the concerns of parents and conservative groups who advocate for censorship.

Furthermore, the writer could have benefited from more precise and accurate language, particularly when referencing specific books and authors. For example, the writer mentions the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series, but does not provide the actual title of the series, making it difficult for readers to understand the context of the argument.

In terms of organization, the essay could have benefited from a clearer introduction and conclusion. The writer jumps directly into the argument without providing a clear thesis statement or summarizing the main points. The conclusion could have been more effective if it had restated the thesis and provided a final thought or call to action.

The essay provides a good start in explaining how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. However, there are areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of a specific example from the story to illustrate the impact of the setting on the cyclist. The quote from the story effectively conveys the cyclist's struggle with the hot climate, which is a clear example of how the setting affects the cyclist's experience. The student demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between the setting and the cyclist's physical condition.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed and organized explanations. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the climate to the terrain without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. Additionally, the sentence structure and grammar need improvement. For instance, the sentence ""If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific and detailed examples to support their claims. The statement ""All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many ways"" is too vague and does not provide a clear conclusion.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on providing more detailed explanations, organizing their ideas more clearly, and using more precise language. They should also ensure that their sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand.

Reasoning: 

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the story's conclusion, but the analysis is somewhat superficial.

For example, the student could discuss how the hibiscus represents the protagonist's connection to her past in Vietnam, and how the geese symbolize her new life in a foreign land. The student could also explain how the protagonist's decision to take the test again is motivated by her desire to prove herself in her new home.

Additionally, the student could provide more evidence from the story to support their claims. For instance, they could mention the protagonist's vow to herself, ""I will take that test again,"" and explain how this vow is connected to the symbolism of the hibiscus and the geese.

Evaluation: The student has made an attempt to analyze the ending of the story, but their explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They correctly identify the main character's comfort in the plants, but their reasoning for the author's choice of ending is not well-supported. The student also introduces an idea that is not present in the story, stating that the main character wants to wait for the geese to come back to take her test. This is not a clear interpretation of the story.

The student could have benefited from a closer reading of the story to identify the main character's emotional state and the significance of the hibiscus plant. For example, the story mentions that the hibiscus is ""budding,"" which suggests new life and growth, and the main character's vow to take the test again in the spring, when the geese return, implies a sense of renewal and hope.

The essay effectively conveys the importance of laughter in the writer's life and provides several relatable anecdotes to support this claim. The writer's enthusiasm and love for making people laugh are evident throughout the essay. The inclusion of specific details, such as facial expressions, jokes, and humorous situations, helps to create a vivid picture of the writer's experiences.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to showcase the writer's personality and relationships with others. The writer's interactions with friends, family, and the exchange student, @PERSON1, demonstrate their ability to find humor in everyday situations and appreciate the quirks of those around them. The writer's use of dialogue and descriptive language adds to the essay's engaging tone and makes it easy to visualize the scenes described.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly connects the writer's experiences to the prompt. While the writer mentions the benefits of laughter, they could further develop this idea by explaining how laughter has positively impacted their relationships or overall well-being.

Additionally, some sentences could be tightened up for better clarity and coherence. For example, the sentence ""When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying"" could be rephrased for more concise expression. Furthermore, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, as the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the writer's friends to introducing the exchange student, @PERSON1.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that people should not remove books and other materials from the shelves if they are found offensive. The essay begins by acknowledging the existence of censorship in libraries, which is a good starting point. However, the student's argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples and evidence to support their position.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to consider multiple perspectives on the issue, including the views of parents who may be concerned about their children being exposed to certain materials. The student also highlights the importance of labeling books by age group and the role of library staff in ensuring that children do not check out books that are not suitable for them.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The student jumps between different ideas and topics, such as the benefits of libraries, the issue of talking in libraries, and the existence of an adult section.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir, but their analysis could be more in-depth and specific. They identify three ways the author creates the mood, but their explanations are brief and lack concrete evidence from the text to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the author's neighborhood, the student mentions that it was made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, but they fail to elaborate on how this specific detail contributes to the warm and happy mood. Similarly, when discussing the author's parents, the student mentions that they were caring, but they don't provide specific examples from the text to illustrate this point.

The student also uses simple sentence structures and lacks transitional phrases to connect their ideas. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied vocabulary and sentence-level analysis. For example, instead of saying ""the author created the mood very well,"" the student could analyze specific techniques used by the author, such as descriptive language or imagery, to create the mood.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, advocating for the removal of offensive books and materials from library shelves. However, the essay falls short in several areas, particularly in terms of organization, coherence, and effective use of evidence.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of a clear and concise thesis statement. The essay jumps abruptly from stating that offensive books should be removed to discussing specific examples without a clear connection between the two ideas. A stronger thesis statement would have provided a clear direction for the essay and helped to guide the reader through the writer's argument.

The essay also suffers from grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and informal language, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2"" instead of proper rating labels is confusing and unprofessional. Additionally, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, making the essay feel like a list of disconnected ideas rather than a cohesive argument.

The student attempts to support their position with personal experience, citing the example of the old library they used to visit. However, this example is not fully developed, and the writer fails to explain how this experience relates to the broader issue of censorship in libraries. Furthermore, the use of phrases like ""some books are inaproprate"" and ""the libarian could get rid of the books"" suggests a lack of understanding of the complexities of censorship and the role of librarians.

The student's suggestion that books with an ""A"" rating should be removed is also problematic, as it oversimplifies the rating system and ignores the fact that many books with mature themes or content may still be valuable and relevant for readers of all ages.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing books to movies, magazines, and music, without a clear connection between these topics. A more effective approach would have been to focus on a single type of material and explore the implications of censorship on that specific medium.

Despite these criticisms, the student shows some potential in their writing, particularly in their ability to express a clear opinion and engage with the topic. With further development and refinement, this writer could produce a more effective and persuasive essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the claims made, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem"" feels like a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow of the essay.

Secondly, the student's analysis of the obstacles could be more in-depth. While the student mentions the law prohibiting dirigibles from approaching the area, the explanation is brief and lacks context. Similarly, the discussion of the fire hazard and the Hindenburg disaster is interesting, but it could be explored further to provide a more nuanced understanding of the risks involved.

Lastly, the student's conclusion that technology advancing beyond predictions was the most important reason for the idea's failure is not fully supported by the excerpt. While it is true that the excerpt mentions the rise of airplanes as a replacement for dirigibles, this is not explicitly stated as the primary reason for the failure.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal experience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's use of language and grammar is often informal and lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. For instance, the sentence ""When I was at @ORGANIZATION1 they was givein out free @CAPS1 of chip"" should be rewritten as ""When I was at the store, they were giving out free bags of chips."" This correction would improve the sentence's coherence and grammar.

The writer also struggles to provide a clear and coherent narrative. The sentence ""I was  reel patient I watet four @NUM4 hour and @NUM5 min"" is confusing, as it seems to be a mix of two different ideas. A more effective way to express this would be ""I was very patient and waited for four hours and five minutes."" Additionally, the writer jumps abruptly from describing the wait to stating that they were going to a location, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

Furthermore, the writer's use of vocabulary is limited, and they rely heavily on informal language and slang. For example, ""we was have a give away day"" should be rewritten as ""we had a giveaway day."" The writer also uses the phrase ""we was going to @LOCATION1 the was the worst patient I @CAPS5 in,"" which is unclear and confusing. A more effective way to express this would be ""we were going to the location, and it was the worst experience I've ever had.""

The writer does attempt to convey the concept of patience, but the execution falls short due to the issues mentioned above. With more attention to grammar, vocabulary, and coherence, the writer could effectively convey their message.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created in the memoir but lacks specific and detailed analysis. The student identifies the mood as ""peacefulness"" and ""gratefulness,"" which is a good start. However, the explanation provided is brief and does not offer concrete evidence from the memoir to support the claim. The mention of Narciso Rodriguez being grateful for his parents and the neighborhood coming together is a good starting point, but it is not developed further. The use of ""{CAPS1}"" is unclear and seems to be a placeholder for a proper noun, but it is not replaced with a relevant entity, which might be distracting.

The student could have benefited from providing more specific quotes or scenes from the memoir to illustrate the peaceful and grateful mood. For instance, they could have described a particular event or conversation that showcases the author's appreciation for his family and community. Additionally, the student could have analyzed how the author's tone, language, and imagery contribute to the overall mood.

Evaluation: The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks coherence, clarity, and a clear understanding of the story's conclusion. The essay meanders through various ideas, including Saeng's personal life, her feelings about the United States, and the significance of the hibiscus flower. However, these ideas are not effectively connected to the prompt, which asks the student to explain why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph.

The student's response fails to provide a clear and concise analysis of the story's conclusion. Instead, they seem to focus on describing Saeng's character and her feelings about her new life in the United States. While these details are relevant to the story, they do not directly address the prompt.

The student also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which makes it difficult to understand their ideas. For example, the sentence ""She say this sentence she is herself back to home"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. Similarly, the phrase ""Her live is very quiet and leavy"" should be ""Her life is very quiet and lonely.""

To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and concise analysis of the story's conclusion, supported by specific examples from the text. They should also work on refining their writing skills, including grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it could be improved in terms of organization, coherence, and sentence structure. The writer attempts to use examples from the story to support their conclusion, but some of the connections between the setting features and the cyclist's experiences are not fully developed.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the negative effects of the setting on the cyclist, such as the heat, lack of water, and abandoned buildings. The writer effectively uses quotes from the story to illustrate the cyclist's emotions and thoughts, such as when the cyclist says, ""I was going to die"" (emphasis on the cyclist's doubt). However, the writer could have provided more analysis of how these setting features contribute to the cyclist's emotional state.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and coherence. Some sentences are fragmented or lack clear connections to the previous sentences. For example, the sentence ""These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better coherence.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more specific and detailed examples from the story to support their claims. For instance, the writer mentions the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant, but does not explain how this specific detail affects the cyclist's experience.

The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the challenges posed by the desert environment, such as the scorching sun, lack of water, and presence of venomous creatures. However, the writing lacks coherence and clarity, making it difficult to follow the cyclist's journey.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of descriptive language and sensory details.

Additionally, the writer fails to provide a clear connection between the setting and the cyclist's emotions or physical state. For example, while it is mentioned that the lack of water ""almost puts him into a heat stroke,"" it is not clear how this affects his physical or mental state.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is often simplistic and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""lousy 12 mph speed"" and ""grope juice factory"" are unclear and detract from the overall quality of the writing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials, such as books, music, and movies, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides personal anecdotes and observations to support their position, which is a good practice in persuasive writing.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing can be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a strong thesis statement that clearly outlines the student's position on censorship in libraries. The introduction sets up the topic, but it does not provide a clear direction for the rest of the essay.

In the body paragraphs, the student provides some good points, such as the idea that books can be kept from children if hidden well enough, but movies and music cannot be hidden in the same manner. However, the student's arguments are not always well-supported, and some points are not clearly connected to the topic. For example, the example about @PERSON1 reading a book in the adult section of the library is not directly related to the issue of censorship.

Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""oppurtunity"" instead of ""opportunity,"" ""innappropriate"" instead of ""inappropriate,"" and ""heinous"" is used incorrectly. The student also uses informal language, such as ""kick back and relax,"" which detracts from the formal tone of a persuasive essay.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to address the prompt, but it requires significant improvement in several areas. The writer's personal experience and emotions are evident throughout the essay, which is a strength. However, the writing lacks coherence, organization, and proper grammar. The writer jumps between ideas and emotions without a clear structure, making it challenging to follow the narrative.

One of the primary issues is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The writer starts with a general statement about the importance of laughter but fails to connect it to the rest of the essay. The essay meanders through the writer's personal struggles, making it difficult to understand the relevance of laughter in the story.

The writer's use of language is also a concern. There are numerous grammatical errors, including misspelled words, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. The writer's tone is often inconsistent, veering between sadness, anger, and determination. While the writer's emotions are genuine, the expression of these emotions could be more effective with better writing skills.

The writer attempts to use sensory details to describe their experience, such as the pain of hearing their little brother cry over the phone. However, these details are not always effective in conveying the writer's emotions. For example, the phrase ""it just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears"" feels like a cliché and doesn't add much depth to the narrative.

The writer's use of transitions and connections between paragraphs is also lacking. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the writer's current situation to a hypothetical future scenario. A clearer connection between these ideas would improve the essay's coherence.

The use of transitional phrases and sentences is also limited, making the essay feel disjointed.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify potential hazards in the setting, such as rocky roads, poisonous snakes, and the lack of help or direction. For example, the student writes, ""because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him it just tired him more.""

The student's response attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks depth and specificity. The student claims that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to ""sum it all up,"" but this statement is too vague and does not provide any concrete evidence from the story to support their claim. Furthermore, the student also mentions that the author used this technique to ""keep the reader wondering,"" but this is a common literary device and does not specifically relate to the context of the story.

The student fails to analyze the significance of the hibiscus plant in the story and its connection to the main character's decision to retake the test. The paragraph also highlights the cyclical nature of life and the passing of time, which is a crucial theme in the story. The student could have explored this theme further and explained how the author uses the hibiscus plant to convey this idea.

To improve, the student should have provided more specific examples from the story to support their claims and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the author's intentions.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but falls short in providing a clear and coherent explanation of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The sentence structure is simple and lacks specific details from the excerpt. The writer fails to provide any relevant information from the excerpt, making it difficult to understand the context of the problem. The use of the phrase ""the problem of mooring air ships to fixed mast at such a height"" is vague and does not accurately convey the challenges faced by the builders. Furthermore, the sentence ""made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear"" is unclear and does not provide any concrete evidence from the excerpt to support the claim.

The essay lacks depth and analysis, and the writer fails to demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic. The writing is also marred by grammatical errors and lacks proper sentence structure.

The essay provided demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computers on people, but it falls short in several areas. The writer effectively conveys their opinion and uses some relevant points to support their argument, such as the decline in communication skills and the potential for obesity. However, the essay is marred by numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherence in some paragraphs.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of punctuation. For instance, the writer states, ""I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10."" This sentence is riddled with errors, making it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning. Additionally, the use of slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"" detracts from the writer's credibility and makes the essay seem less polished.

The writer also fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention statistics about students using computers and scoring lower grades, they do not provide a credible source for these statistics. Furthermore, the writer's assertion that people are more likely to become obese due to computer use is not supported by any concrete evidence.

In terms of organization, the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the negative effects of computers to urging readers to ""dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature!"" This conclusion feels disconnected from the rest of the essay and does not effectively summarize the writer's main points.

Despite these criticisms, the writer demonstrates a clear and passionate stance on the issue, and their use of rhetorical questions, such as ""What is so daunting about @CAPS2?"" effectively engages the reader. However, the essay's numerous errors and lack of coherence prevent it from being a strong persuasive piece.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of vivid imagery to describe the cyclist's experience in the desert. The writer effectively conveys the cyclist's struggle with dehydration, using phrases such as ""wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt"" and ""growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" These examples demonstrate how the hot desert setting is affecting the cyclist's physical and mental state.

However, the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and sentences. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the cyclist's dehydration to stating that the setting affected the cyclist greatly. A more logical connection between these ideas would strengthen the essay.

Additionally, some of the sentences could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, the sentence ""The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration"" could be rephrased to make it more concise and direct.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the student could have provided a clearer and more direct thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The current introduction is somewhat vague and does not effectively grab the reader's attention.

Additionally, the student could have organized the essay in a more logical and coherent manner. The transition between the two obstacles mentioned (weight stress and safety issues) is abrupt, and the reader may find it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles mentioned. For example, the student could have discussed how the weight stress would affect the building's foundation or how the use of hydrogen in blimps posed a significant risk to the populated area of New York.

Lastly, the student could have improved the writing quality by using more precise language and avoiding some grammatical errors. For instance, the sentence ""Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium"" could be rephrased to ""Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist's mood in the story. The essay provides specific examples from the narrative to support the conclusion, which is a key aspect of effective writing. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure, vocabulary, and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the impact of the setting on the cyclist's mood. For instance, when the cyclist encounters the ""ghost town and the old pump,"" the student notes that the cyclist's determination is evident (""I could make that""). This shows that the student can analyze the text and identify the emotional response of the character to the setting. Similarly, when the cyclist sees the sign warning him about the road ahead, the student correctly notes that the cyclist becomes depressed (""I was sad""). This demonstrates the student's ability to recognize how the setting can affect the character's emotions.

However, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. For example, the sentence ""The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and coherence.

Additionally, the student could use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting. For instance, instead of saying ""bumpy, terrain,"" the student could describe the terrain as ""rocky,"" ""hilly,"" or ""uneven"" to create a more immersive experience for the reader.

Finally, the student could provide more analysis of the setting and its impact on the cyclist's mood. While the essay identifies the setting's effect on the cyclist's emotions, it could delve deeper into the reasons why the setting has this impact. For example, the student could explore how the abandoned towns and old pump create a sense of desolation and isolation, which contributes to the cyclist's depression.

The student has attempted to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their essay requires significant improvement in terms of organization, coherence, and writing quality. The student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of clarity in their arguments.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the student's inability to articulate their thoughts in a coherent and logical manner. The writing jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it challenging to follow the student's train of thought. For instance, the student starts by disagreeing with the notion that computers have a positive effect on people, but then veers off into a discussion about obesity and the importance of exercise. While the student attempts to connect these ideas to their argument, the transition is unclear and confusing.

Furthermore, the student's use of language is often informal and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""Likewise of corse,"" ""Wounder why,"" and ""exsperiance"" demonstrate a lack of attention to grammar and spelling. The student also relies heavily on simplistic and emotive language, such as ""People are so fat!"" and ""Don't use computers for stupid reasons,"" which detract from the credibility of their argument.

The student does attempt to provide some valid points, such as the negative impact of excessive computer use on physical health and the importance of interacting with nature and friends in person. However, these ideas are not fully developed or supported with evidence, and the student fails to address the opposing viewpoint in a nuanced and respectful manner.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clear and logical structure, using proper grammar and spelling, and providing evidence to support their claims. They should also strive to present their argument in a more respectful and persuasive manner.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that it should not be allowed. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear thesis statement. The student provides several convincing arguments to support their position, including the idea that libraries are meant to provide diverse perspectives and that censorship would stifle the expression of opinions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition (""everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same"") and metaphors (""the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion""). These devices help to engage the reader and make the essay more engaging.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their arguments, such as examples of books that have been censored or the impact of censorship on society.

The student's use of grammar and punctuation is generally good, but there are some errors, such as missing articles (""a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf"") and incorrect verb tenses (""People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library"").

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided specific examples from the memoir to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of writing quality, analysis, and grammar. 

The student's thesis statement is clear and concise, stating that the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a mood that is ""uplifting and happy."" They provide three reasons to support this claim, which are all taken from the memoir. The student's analysis of the text is also commendable, as they identify specific lines and paragraphs that contribute to the overall mood of the memoir.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more depth and complexity. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the student states that Narciso is grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice, but they do not explain why this is significant or how it contributes to the overall mood of the memoir. Similarly, in paragraph @NUM2, the student states that Narciso's statement about family is uplifting, but they do not elaborate on what makes this statement meaningful or how it relates to the memoir's overall theme.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""basicaly,"" ""enviorment,"" and ""article."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's points.

Reasoning: 

The student's response shows that they have grasped the basic idea of the story's conclusion, which is Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a unique perspective, as they express both support and opposition to the idea of removing materials deemed offensive from library shelves. The writer's use of personal anecdotes, such as the example of a music store with explicit content and a tobacco product display, effectively illustrates their point that people have different tastes and preferences.

However, the essay's structure and organization are somewhat disorganized, making it challenging to follow the writer's argument. The writer jumps between supporting and opposing views without a clear transition, which can confuse the reader. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""Im for it and against it"" and ""This goes from kids to adults"" could be rephrased for clarity and coherence.

The writer's language and vocabulary are mostly simple and straightforward, which is suitable for a middle school level. However, there are instances of grammatical errors, such as ""i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened."" The writer could benefit from proofreading and editing to refine their writing.

The writer's use of Katherine Paterson's quote as a prompt is a good starting point, but they fail to fully develop their argument in relation to the quote. A more in-depth analysis of the quote and its relevance to the topic would strengthen the essay.

The student correctly identifies the main character, Saeng, and her decision to retake the driver's test in the spring. However, their reasoning for Saeng's decision is somewhat simplistic and lacks concrete evidence from the story. The student mentions that Saeng feels confident and happy due to being comfortable with the plant and her mother's reduced anger, but this is not explicitly stated in the text. 

The student also makes a connection between the blooming of the hibiscus and the renewal of life, which is a valid interpretation of the story's themes. However, this idea could be further developed and supported with more textual evidence. For instance, the student could discuss how the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and resilience, which is reflected in Saeng's determination to retake the test.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, but it requires improvement in several areas to effectively convey their argument. Here are some specific observations and suggestions:

1. **Thesis statement**: The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument. The student starts with a quote from Katherine Paterson, but fails to connect it to their own position on censorship. A stronger thesis statement would help guide the reader through the essay.

2. **Organization**: The essay jumps abruptly from introducing the quote to sharing a personal experience. A more logical flow would be to connect the quote to the student's personal experience and then develop the argument. Additionally, the transition to the conclusion feels abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main points.

3. **Supporting evidence**: While the student shares a personal experience, it is not well-developed. They could have provided more details about the book, such as its title, author, and specific scenes that they found objectionable. This would help the reader understand the context and the student's concerns.

4. **Counterarguments**: The essay lacks consideration of opposing viewpoints. The student assumes that everyone will agree with their stance on censorship, but a more convincing argument would acknowledge potential counterarguments and address them.

5. **Language and grammar**: The essay contains several grammatical errors, such as ""or have this one book that we read and hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf"" (subject-verb agreement) and ""I, myself personally feel"" (unnecessary use of ""myself""). The student should proofread their work more carefully.

6. **Tone and audience**: The essay's tone is somewhat confrontational, which may not be effective in persuading readers. A more respectful and considerate tone would be more persuasive.

Firstly, the writer fails to address the opposing viewpoint, which is a crucial aspect of a persuasive essay. The prompt explicitly mentions that not everyone agrees that computers have a positive effect on society, but the writer does not acknowledge this perspective.

Moreover, the writer's arguments are not well-supported and lack coherence. The sentences are short and lack transitional phrases, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For instance, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing meeting new people to learning about technology. Additionally, the writer uses informal language and grammatical errors, such as ""u can,"" ""buiseness,"" and ""kno,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The writer attempts to provide a personal anecdote about a time when they were patient, but the narrative is fragmented and lacks specific details. The sentence structure is simple, and the language is basic.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The writer jumps abruptly from describing the long line in the store to explaining that the person in front of them had a big cart of food. The connection between these two ideas is unclear, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is limited, with phrases such as ""I whas I was buying"" and ""food their food"" that suggest a lack of attention to grammar and spelling. The writer also fails to provide any specific examples or details about how they remained patient during the wait, making it hard to understand the full extent of their patience.

To improve this essay, the writer could focus on providing a more detailed and coherent narrative, using more complex sentence structures and vocabulary to convey their ideas. They could also consider adding more specific examples or details about how they remained patient, such as what they did to distract themselves or how they felt during the wait.

However, the writing could benefit from more organization and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use specific examples to illustrate their points. For instance, when discussing the importance of laughter in relationships, the writer shares a story about their friends always laughing together, whether they are doing something or just being around each other. This shows that the writer has a good understanding of the concept and can apply it to real-life situations.

However, the essay could be improved in terms of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, such as ""streanthend"" instead of ""strengthened,"" ""imporntant"" instead of ""important,"" and ""absloutley"" instead of ""absolutely."" These errors can make the essay difficult to read and understand.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more transitional phrases and sentences to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better. For example, the writer jumps abruptly from discussing the importance of laughter in relationships to explaining why people laugh at pain. A transitional phrase or sentence could help to connect these ideas and make the essay more cohesive.

Finally, the writer could benefit from more depth and analysis in their writing. While they provide some good examples, they do not fully explain why laughter is important or how it affects relationships.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's themes and has attempted to identify the moods created by the author. However, there are several areas where the student's analysis could be improved. Firstly, the student has identified three moods - love, selflessness, and gratitude - but has not provided sufficient evidence from the text to support the mood of gratitude. The student only mentions Rodriguez's gratitude for his cooking abilities, love for Cuban music, and his parents' love and sacrifice, but does not provide specific quotes or examples from the text to back up these claims.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the mood of love is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. While the student correctly identifies the quote from paragraph @NUM1, they do not fully explain how this quote contributes to the overall mood of love. For example, they could have discussed how the quote shows the importance of family and community in Rodriguez's life, or how it highlights the selflessness of his parents.

Additionally, the student's analysis of the mood of selflessness is accurate, but could be more nuanced. They could have explored how Rodriguez's decision to move to a new country and face hardships was not just a selfless act, but also a complex and multifaceted decision that was motivated by a desire to provide a better life for his children.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt, but their analysis of the mood in the memoir is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They correctly identify the happy and grateful tone, but fail to provide specific evidence from the memoir to support their claims. The student relies heavily on general statements and does not provide concrete examples from the text to illustrate their points. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and sentence structure issues that detract from the overall clarity of the essay.

For instance, the student states that the narrator ""loved living there with his parents and having family members around,"" but does not provide any specific details from the memoir to support this claim. They also mention that the narrator ""learned about all the cooking,"" but do not specify what type of cooking or how it relates to the memoir's mood.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are short and simple, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. The student also uses phrases such as ""he seems to have had a very nice childhood,"" which is a vague statement that does not add much depth to the analysis.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses specific examples from the story to support their conclusion. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure, grammar, and clarity.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the features of the setting that impact the cyclist. The writer mentions the high deserts of California in June, which is a challenging environment for a cyclist. This is a good starting point, but the writer could have elaborated more on how this setting affects the cyclist. For instance, they could have discussed how the heat and dryness of the desert might cause dehydration or fatigue.

The writer also provides a vivid example of the cyclist's struggle to find clean water. The image of the tarlike substance and brackish water is a powerful one, and it effectively conveys the difficulties the cyclist faces. However, the sentence could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, ""the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn’t drink"" could be rephrased as ""The cyclist encountered a town with a rusted water pump, which yielded a tarlike substance and brackish water that was undrinkable.""

The writer also mentions that the old-timers said the towns would be close when they were actually far apart. This is a good example of how the setting can affect the cyclist's perception of reality. However, this point could be developed further to explain how this affects the cyclist's journey.

In terms of grammar and sentence structure, there are a few areas for improvement. The writer could benefit from varying sentence length and structure to create a more dynamic and engaging text. Additionally, there are a few grammatical errors, such as the use of ""affect"" instead of ""effect"" in the first sentence.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves due to their potentially offensive content. The essay provides some personal opinions and observations, but lacks depth and supporting evidence to strengthen the argument.

Strengths:

1. The student has taken a clear stance on the issue, which is essential for a persuasive essay.
2. The writer has attempted to address potential counterarguments, such as the concern about children accessing offensive materials, by suggesting that parents can make their own decisions about what their children consume.
3. The student has used some relevant examples, such as the existence of back rooms in stores where offensive materials are kept, to support their argument.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument.
2. The writer relies heavily on personal opinions and observations, without providing concrete evidence or examples to support their claims.
3. The essay could benefit from more organization and coherence, as some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the text.
4. The writer uses simplistic language and sentence structures, which may not effectively convey their message to the target audience.
5. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful consideration of the complexities surrounding censorship in libraries.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but falls short in several areas. Firstly, the language used is informal and lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning. The sentence structure is also simplistic, with a lack of varied and complex sentences that could enhance the overall coherence and flow of the essay. Furthermore, the essay relies heavily on vague terms such as ""naivors"" which seems to be a typo and ""everything he needs"" is too general and does not provide a clear picture of the author's gratitude.

The essay could be improved by incorporating more specific details from the memoir to support the author's claim. For instance, the author could describe a particular event or experience that evokes a sense of gratitude in the reader. Additionally, using more precise language and varied sentence structures would enhance the overall quality of the essay.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that individuals should have the freedom to choose what materials they want to read or watch. The essay begins with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their argument, highlighting the importance of individual choice and the potential consequences of censorship.

Strengths:

1.  The student takes a clear stance on the topic and supports it with personal experiences, making the argument more relatable and engaging.
2.  The use of the quote from Katherine Paterson adds depth and credibility to the essay.
3.  The student attempts to address potential counterarguments, such as the idea that certain materials might be inappropriate for children, by suggesting that they could be placed in a separate section.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas and sentences feeling somewhat disconnected from each other.
2.  The writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as many of the sentences are simple and lack depth.
3.  The student could have provided more evidence to support their argument, such as statistics or expert opinions.

The writer mentions that the builders couldn't drop the mast on the top of the building's flat roof due to wind stress on the frame, but this is not directly related to the docking of dirigibles. The mention of blimps is also unclear, as dirigibles and blimps are often used interchangeably, but the writer seems to be referring to a different type of airship. The writer also fails to provide any specific information from the excerpt to support their claims.

The essay also contains grammatical errors, such as ""Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that"" which should be ""Some problems that the builders faced when building the mast on the top of the building were that."" Additionally, the sentence ""The cost for these modifications were another problem for them two"" is incorrect, as ""were"" should be ""was"" and ""them two"" should be ""them.""

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a mixed view on the topic, but it lacks a clear and well-supported argument. The writer starts by acknowledging that individuals have different opinions about books, which is a valid point. However, the essay quickly devolves into a confusing and unclear stance on censorship.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The writer jumps between different topics, such as books, movies, and magazines, without providing a clear connection between them. This makes it difficult to follow the writer's argument and understand their position on censorship.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often informal and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""What I think about that is that"" and ""I mean come on now"" are not suitable for a persuasive essay and detract from the writer's credibility. Additionally, the writer uses incomplete sentences and relies on vague statements, such as ""there should be certain things that are up there.""

The writer also fails to provide any concrete evidence or examples to support their argument. They do not engage with the quote from Katherine Paterson, which is a crucial part of the prompt. The writer's only attempt to address the quote is a vague statement that ""just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't.""

In terms of content, the writer's argument is also flawed. They suggest that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, but they do not define what they consider ""offensive."" This lack of clarity makes it difficult to understand the writer's position and evaluate their argument.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The writer effectively identifies the theme of graciousness and supports it with specific quotes from the memoir. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence structure, vocabulary, and analysis.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify and describe the mood of graciousness in the memoir. The writer provides specific quotes from the text to support their claim, which demonstrates a good understanding of the material. For instance, the quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" effectively conveys the author's feeling of gratitude towards their parents. Additionally, the writer's analysis of the quote ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" shows a good understanding of the author's perspective on family.

However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and deeper exploration of the quotes. The writer primarily provides surface-level summaries of the quotes without delving deeper into their significance or implications. For example, the writer could have explored how the author's understanding of family affects their relationships with others or how their parents' sacrifices impacted their life.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. For instance, the sentence ""The final express of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him"" could be rephrased to ""In addition to the author's gratitude towards their parents' love and sacrifice, their feelings towards the passions their parents taught them also convey a sense of graciousness.""

Lastly, the writer could benefit from more precise vocabulary. Phrases such as ""these express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood"" could be rephrased to ""these passions and skills have had a lasting impact on the author's life.""

Evaluation: The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and depth in explaining why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. The student's main point about the paragraph indicating it's winter due to the mention of snowmelt is accurate but does not directly relate to the author's purpose for concluding the story with this paragraph.

The student fails to consider the significance of the paragraph in the context of the story's themes and character development. The paragraph reveals Saeng's determination and resilience, which is a crucial aspect of her character. The mention of taking the test again in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, suggests a connection between nature's cycles and Saeng's personal growth. This connection is not explored in the student's response.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks proper grammar, spelling, and sentence structure, which makes it difficult to understand their ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has attempted to address the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar, which affects the overall quality of the writing. 

The student has identified three main obstacles: adding a mooring mast, the risk of a dirigible explosion, and the impact of violent winds. The first point is well-supported by the idea that the architects had to re-support the entire skeleton of the building, which shows a good understanding of the complexity of the task. However, the second point is not directly supported by the excerpt, as there is no mention of the Hindenburg disaster in the provided text. This suggests that the student may have introduced external knowledge, which is not ideal.

The third point about violent winds is also not directly supported by the excerpt, as there is no mention of the impact of winds on pedestrians. The student may have inferred this point, but it would be more effective to stick to the information provided in the excerpt.

In terms of writing quality, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is lacking. The sentences are short and lack cohesion, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, such as the use of ""Simply"" instead of ""simply"" and the incorrect use of ""@"" symbol.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, particularly in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and attention to detail. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the competitive pressure from Al Smith, the governor of New York, to build the tallest building in the world. This is a relevant point, as it highlights the external pressure that the builders faced. However, the student could have provided more context about how this pressure affected the building process.

The student also correctly identifies the challenge of creating a successful mooring mast that wouldn't harm the building's structure. The quote from the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame,"" is a good example of how the student has supported their answer with relevant information. However, the student could have explained the significance of this quote in more detail.

The student's discussion of the obstacles related to the mooring mast is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear structure. The student jumps between different points without providing a clear connection between them. For example, the student mentions that the mooring mast was ""dangerous for diringibles to land there"" and that the diringibles were ""highly flammable."" While these points are relevant, they could have been integrated more smoothly into the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to detail. For instance, the student writes ""Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework,"" but the symbol ""@"" is not a standard unit of currency.

The writer's main idea is clear: the author feels a sense of love and appreciation for their family, which is not limited by blood relations. However, the execution of this idea is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and insufficient evidence from the memoir to support the claim.

Firstly, the essay lacks proper grammar and sentence structure. The writer uses simple sentences that are often fragmented and lack clarity. For instance, the sentence ""The author loves thier parents because they came 'as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life' (@NUM2)"" is grammatically incorrect and does not flow well. The writer should have used a more complex sentence structure to convey their ideas.

Secondly, the essay lacks coherence and transitions between ideas. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing the author's neighborhood to their parents' immigration story. A more logical connection between these ideas would have made the essay more cohesive.

Lastly, the writer fails to provide sufficient evidence from the memoir to support their claim. While they mention that the author's parents ""came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM3), they do not explain how this relates to the mood of love.

Firstly, the student's thesis statement is clear and concise, stating that the author of the memoir created a peaceful mood. However, the supporting evidence provided is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student mentions that the author never mentioned any negative activities in the memoir, but this is not a sufficient reason to conclude that the memoir has a peaceful mood. A more nuanced analysis of the author's use of language, imagery, and tone would be more convincing.

Secondly, the student's writing could benefit from more specific and detailed examples from the memoir to support their claims. For instance, when discussing the author's description of his house, the student could have provided a more detailed analysis of how the author's use of words like ""simple,"" ""warm,"" ""humble,"" and ""full of memories"" contributes to the peaceful mood. Similarly, when discussing the author's portrayal of the neighborhood, the student could have provided more specific examples of how the author's description of the neighbors being ""friendly"" and ""caring"" creates a sense of safety and security.

Thirdly, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. This makes the essay feel a bit disjointed and difficult to follow.

The student effectively uses rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize their point, such as ""Why should censorship exist in our media if it doesn't exist in our everyday lives?"" and ""Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?""

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence.

Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been."" The use of colloquial expressions and informal language, such as ""People these days though,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more concrete examples to support their argument. While they mention that censorship denies the right to free speech, they do not elaborate on how this affects individuals or society as a whole. The essay could also benefit from more nuanced discussion of the complexities of censorship, such as the potential harm caused by certain materials or the role of parental discretion.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence. The writer uses the word ""proud"" to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but fails to provide specific evidence from the text to support this claim. The sentence ""she is saing what her parents did for her"" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the prompt. It seems the writer is trying to convey that the author is expressing gratitude towards her parents, but the sentence is too vague and does not effectively convey this idea.

The student's writing also lacks proper sentence structure and grammar. The use of ""saing"" instead of ""saying"" is a significant error that detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the writer does not provide any specific details or quotes from the memoir to support their claim, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of their response.

To improve, the student should focus on providing clear and concise writing, using proper grammar and spelling, and incorporating specific evidence from the memoir to support their claims.

The student's response attempts to analyze the author's conclusion but lacks a clear and focused argument. The student's main idea is that the author wants the reader to notice the bond between Saeng and her mother through gardening. However, this idea is not well-supported by specific details from the story. The student mentions that the author shows a way the mother and child bond through gardening, but this is not explicitly stated in the story. The student also makes a general statement about the author's writing style, saying that the author has a ""great mind and a good way thinking,"" but this is not relevant to the specific conclusion of the story.

The student does mention that the story is a ""gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from {LOCATION} to live out the rest of their lives,"" but this is not a conclusion drawn from the story, but rather a summary of the plot. The student also uses phrases such as ""it was fairly neat,"" ""it was a fairly interesting story,"" and ""it sounded very good to me,"" which are subjective opinions and do not provide a clear analysis of the author's conclusion.

The student's response could be improved by providing specific examples from the story to support their argument and avoiding general statements about the author's writing style. The student could also focus on the specific paragraph provided in the prompt and analyze why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng's vow to take the test again in the spring.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The student has attempted to write about a personal experience related to patience, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and a lack of coherence.

One of the major issues with the essay is the numerous grammatical errors, such as ""A time when I was patience,"" ""barly,"" ""illes,"" ""il,"" ""hurted,"" ""herted,"" ""magizene,"" and ""braekes."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

Furthermore, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The student jumps between ideas and sentences without a clear connection between them. For example, the transition from describing the crowded store to the family's experience at the checkout line is abrupt and unclear.

The student also struggles to provide specific details and descriptions that would make the experience more engaging and relatable. The use of phrases like ""It was like a duster of pebles in the sand"" and ""It was like a whole mall in one little store"" is clichéd and lacks originality.

However, the student attempts to demonstrate the concept of patience by describing the family's experience at the store. The student shows an understanding of what it means to be patient, as they describe their mother's frustration and their father's calm demeanor.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They have correctly identified the issue of stress on the building's frame due to the weight of the dirigible and the safety concerns related to the use of hydrogen in most foreign dirigibles. However, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the mooring mast to the safety concerns, and the transitions between sentences could be smoother. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt to support their claims.

The student's use of quotes from the excerpt is a good start, but they could have analyzed the quotes more thoroughly to provide a deeper understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders. For example, they could have explained why the use of hydrogen was a significant safety concern or how the builders' decision to build the mooring mast was a response to the stress issue.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack descriptive language, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. The student could have also provided a clearer conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the significance of the obstacles faced by the builders.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with three main points presented to support the argument. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, grammar, and referencing specific information from the excerpt.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the safety concerns related to hydrogen-filled dirigibles, referencing the ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst. This shows that the student has a good understanding of the historical context and can connect it to the topic at hand. Additionally, the student mentions the wind currents at the top of the Empire State building as another obstacle, which is a relevant point.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific details and evidence from the excerpt to support the claims made. For instance, the student mentions a law about airships flying too low over urban areas, but does not provide any information about where this law is mentioned in the excerpt. This lack of specificity makes the argument less convincing.

Furthermore, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay, such as ""far to great"" instead of ""too great"" and ""something that should have been obvious before construction started"" which is a bit unclear. The student could benefit from revising the essay to make it more concise and clear.

The essay effectively conveys the writer's stance on censorship in libraries, using personal anecdotes and logical reasoning to support their argument. The writer's use of rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios engages the reader and encourages them to consider the potential consequences of censorship. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed analysis of the issue, as well as more effective organization and transitions between paragraphs.

One of the strengths of the essay is its use of personal experience to illustrate the writer's point. The writer's recollection of being told ""no"" by their parents as a child and the subsequent realization that they can now make their own decisions is a relatable and effective way to introduce the topic of censorship. The writer also uses this experience to argue that children should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they watch and read, rather than having it dictated to them by others.

The writer's use of hypothetical scenarios, such as the removal of movies and games from shelves, is also effective in highlighting the potential consequences of censorship. The writer's argument that even if some movies are removed, new ones will simply take their place is a valid point, and the writer's use of examples from popular culture, such as the remake of a classic film, adds credibility to this argument.

However, the essay could benefit from more attention to organization and transitions between paragraphs. The writer jumps abruptly from discussing personal experience to hypothetical scenarios, and the connections between these ideas could be more explicitly stated. Additionally, the writer could benefit from more detailed analysis of the issue of censorship, including the potential impact on children's development and the role of parents in guiding their children's choices.

In terms of writing style, the writer's use of rhetorical questions and colloquial language makes the essay engaging and accessible. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall quality of the writing. For example, the sentence ""You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them"" is unclear and could be rephrased for greater clarity.

The student starts by describing the desert-like setting in Lodi, California, which is a good start.

Furthermore, the student jumps abruptly to the idea that the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite to escape the heat, without providing any clear connection between the setting and the cyclist's actions. The student also fails to provide any evidence from the text to support this claim.

The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing the concept of patience, but it lacks coherence and clarity. The writer starts by stating that patience is useful in certain situations, but then abruptly shifts to a contrasting example of the army, which seems unrelated to the initial statement. The transition between the two ideas is unclear, and the writer fails to provide a logical connection between them.

The writer also struggles to provide concrete examples to support their claims. The statement ""you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy"" is a vague and disturbing example that does not effectively illustrate the concept of patience. Furthermore, the writer's assertion that patience is mostly good because rushing might lead to negative consequences is a general statement that lacks specific evidence.

The writer's writing style is also informal and lacks proper grammar and punctuation. The use of phrases such as ""to me your??? again"" is unclear and confusing, and the sentence structure is often simplistic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, advocating for the removal of materials deemed offensive. The essay begins with a relevant quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the argument. However, the student's writing could benefit from a more cohesive and focused structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to connect their personal experience and observations to the topic. They effectively use examples from everyday life, such as walking into stores and finding objectionable materials, to illustrate the prevalence of potentially harmful content. The student also attempts to address the issue of children's exposure to negative ideas through media, such as movies, music, and books.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the writing lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps between ideas and fails to provide a clear argument. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

Furthermore, the student relies heavily on general statements and clichés, such as ""the children are the future of the world"" and ""it will be a better world if we do."" These statements lack specificity and do not provide concrete evidence to support the student's argument. The student also fails to address potential counterarguments, which would strengthen their position and demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

Firstly, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and punctuation mistakes.

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be more nuanced and developed. While they mention the benefits of computers, such as communication and access to information, they do not fully address the counterarguments presented in the prompt. For example, they mention that people spend too much time on computers, but they do not provide a clear solution to this problem or suggest ways to mitigate its effects.

Additionally, the student's conclusion could be more effective.

Firstly, the student's writing is clear and easy to follow, making it accessible to the reader. The use of transitional phrases such as ""Another problem was"" helps to connect the ideas and create a logical flow.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to convey the concept of patience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's personal experience is used to illustrate the idea of patience, but the narrative is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and an inconsistent tone.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the poor grammar and spelling. The writer uses phrases such as ""I didn't have no patience at all,"" ""he said not now"" (missing article), and ""I said pleaseee"" (excessive punctuation). These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand at times. The writer should focus on using correct grammar and spelling to convey their message effectively.

Another issue with the essay is the lack of coherence. The writer jumps abruptly from one scene to another, making it challenging to follow the narrative. For instance, the writer mentions going downstairs and eating lunch, but it is unclear why this is relevant to the story. A more cohesive narrative would help to engage the reader and make the story more believable.

The tone of the essay is also inconsistent. The writer starts by expressing eagerness and impatience but then shifts to anger and frustration. While this is a natural progression in the story, it would be more effective if the writer could convey a more nuanced understanding of patience. A patient person might experience frustration, but they would also be able to manage their emotions and wait for the desired outcome.

Despite these issues, the writer does attempt to illustrate the concept of patience. The story shows how the writer's dad encourages patience and eventually rewards it with a new bike. This is a good way to demonstrate the benefits of patience, and the writer could have built on this idea more effectively.

The writer's main points are centered around the idea that a library should be a place of learning and growth, and that offensive materials can hinder this goal. However, the essay lacks depth and nuance in its argumentation.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of concrete examples to support the writer's claims. The student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal,"" without providing specific instances or evidence to back up this assertion. This makes the argument feel somewhat superficial and unconvincing.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language and grammar is often simplistic and riddled with errors. Phrases like ""I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied"" and ""a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know"" demonstrate a need for improvement in sentence structure and vocabulary.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from a more thoughtful exploration of the complexities surrounding censorship. The writer's blanket statement that ""if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out the library"" oversimplifies the issue, ignoring the potential consequences of censorship on free speech and intellectual freedom.

Despite these criticisms, the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and a willingness to express their opinion. With further development and refinement, their argument could be more compelling and persuasive.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt to support the answer, which is a positive aspect of the writing. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the student has correctly identified the frame of the building, safety concerns, conditions at the top of the building, and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas as obstacles. The student has also provided relevant information from the excerpt to support these points, such as the need to modify the frame to a stronger material and the risk of hydrogen catching on fire.

However, there are some issues with the writing quality. The student has used the term ""durgible"" instead of ""dirigible,"" which is a minor error but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the sentence structure and grammar could be improved in some places. For example, the sentence ""With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used"" feels like a conclusion that could be more effectively integrated into the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more analysis and explanation of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, the student could have discussed how the safety concerns and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas interacted with each other, or how the conditions at the top of the building affected the design of the mooring mast.

The student has attempted to express their opinion on censorship in libraries, but their essay requires improvement in several areas. Here are some specific comments on the content:

1. **Clear thesis statement**: The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument. The student jumps directly into their personal experiences without a clear direction.
2. **Organization**: The essay lacks a logical flow of ideas. The student jumps between different topics, such as music, magazines, and movies, without connecting them to the main argument.
3. **Supporting evidence**: While the student provides some personal anecdotes, they lack concrete evidence to support their claims. For example, they mention that certain music is ""horrifying"" but don't provide specific examples or statistics to back up this claim.
4. **Language and tone**: The student's language is informal and sometimes awkward, which detracts from the persuasive quality of the essay. The tone is also somewhat emotional and judgmental, which may not be convincing to readers.
5. **Citation and referencing**: The student mentions that they ""read somewhere"" that things children see at a young age have a great effect on who they will become, but they don't provide a source or reference to support this claim.
6. **Grammar and mechanics**: The essay contains several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the memoir's tone, but their analysis could be more nuanced and supported by specific details from the text. The student correctly identifies the happy and loving mood of the memoir but fails to provide concrete evidence to back up their claims. For instance, they mention that Narciso's parents had ""their arms and dores open to any body they considered family,"" but they do not specify which events or passages in the memoir illustrate this point. Additionally, the student's conclusion that Narciso had a ""very happy, loving childhood"" feels somewhat generic and could be more effectively supported by specific examples from the memoir.

The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of their writing. For example, ""apreciates"" should be spelled ""appreciates,"" and ""there"" should be ""their"" in the sentence ""His mom and dad always had there arms and dores open to any body they considered family."" Furthermore, the sentence structure is often simplistic and lacks variety, which makes the writing feel somewhat flat.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the issue, arguing that certain materials, such as books, music, and movies, should be removed from public libraries if they are deemed offensive. The student's personal experience of encountering an offensive book in a public library serves as a catalyst for their argument. However, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and developed ideas, as well as stronger evidence to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to share a personal anecdote that illustrates their point. The description of encountering an offensive book in the library and feeling upset by the language and images is a powerful example of how certain materials can be hurtful. The student also raises valid concerns about the potential impact of exposure to mature themes on younger children.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more depth and complexity to the argument. For instance, the student could explore the concept of censorship and its implications on free speech, or discuss the role of libraries as a safe space for diverse perspectives and ideas. Additionally, the student could provide more evidence to support their claims, such as statistics or expert opinions, to make their argument more convincing.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the text, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. These errors can detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

In terms of organization, the essay could be improved by a clearer introduction and conclusion. The introduction could provide a more explicit thesis statement, and the conclusion could summarize the main points and reiterate the student's position on censorship in libraries.

The essay provided lacks a clear connection to the prompt, which asks for an explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay instead focuses on general road safety tips without providing any specific examples or analysis of how the setting influences the cyclist's experience. The writer mentions ""many things that could happen"" but fails to elaborate on what these things are or how the setting contributes to them. Furthermore, the sentence ""You have to take control when you're on the road"" is a vague statement that doesn't demonstrate an understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist.

The essay also lacks coherence and organization, with a disjointed structure that doesn't flow smoothly. The writer jumps abruptly from a general statement to a vague warning without providing any supporting evidence or analysis. The language is also simplistic and lacks detail, making it difficult to understand the writer's point.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing specific examples from the setting that affect the cyclist, such as road conditions, weather, or traffic patterns. They should also provide more detail and analysis to support their claims, and work on organizing their ideas in a clear and logical manner.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it falls short in providing a detailed and nuanced analysis. The writer mentions that the author is thankful for his parents' decision to move for him, which suggests a positive mood. However, the explanation is brief and lacks specific examples from the memoir to support this claim. The writer also mentions that the author's parents came to give him a better life, but this statement is not directly related to the mood created in the memoir. The writer could have explored the emotional impact of this decision on the author and how it influenced the overall mood of the memoir.

The writer's use of simple sentences and basic vocabulary limits the depth of analysis. For instance, the phrase ""He was thankful his parents moved for him and thinks it was very nice"" could be expanded upon to provide more insight into the author's emotions and thoughts. Additionally, the writer could have explored the contrast between the author's gratitude and any potential difficulties or challenges he faced during the move.

To improve, the writer should focus on providing more specific examples from the memoir and analyzing the author's emotions and thoughts in more depth. This would help to create a more detailed and engaging analysis of the mood created in the memoir.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay effectively identifies the primary concern as the stress to the building's frame due to the dirigible's load and wind pressure. However, the analysis could be more comprehensive and detailed.

One notable strength of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific information, such as the depth of the building's foundation (eleven hundred feet below) and the cost of modifications (over sixty thousand dollars). These details demonstrate the student's effort to support their answer with relevant information from the excerpt.

However, the essay could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the obstacles. For instance, the student could have explored the potential risks associated with modifying the building's framework or the impact of wind pressure on the structure. Additionally, the essay could have benefited from a clearer explanation of how the stress to the building's frame would be transmitted to the foundation.

Furthermore, the essay could have been more effective if it had addressed the excerpt's mention of the building's ""steel frame"" and how it would need to be modified and strengthened. The student could have also explored the potential challenges of accommodating the dirigible's size and weight.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist's thoughts and emotions. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's survival. The student has provided two examples from the passage to support their conclusion, but the analysis could be more detailed and nuanced.

One strength of the essay is that the student has identified specific moments in the passage where the setting affects the cyclist's thoughts. For instance, when the cyclist sees the mule, he starts to doubt the old man's advice, which suggests that the setting is influencing his perception of reality. The student also correctly notes that the broken-down juice factory gives the cyclist no hope, leading him to accept his fate.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's survival. For example, the student could have explored how the setting's features, such as the mule and the juice factory, contribute to the cyclist's physical and emotional state. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the passage to support their conclusion, such as the cyclist's physical reactions to the setting, like his decision to put pebbles in his mouth.

Furthermore, the student's writing could be more polished, with more attention to grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. For instance, the sentence ""This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die"" could be rephrased for clarity and concision.

The student has attempted to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their essay lacks clarity, coherence, and effective organization. The writing is informal, and the tone is conversational, which is not suitable for a formal letter to a newspaper. The student's argument is also based on personal experiences and opinions rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student starts by stating that they think it's a bad idea to make kids stay off of computers, but they don't provide a clear explanation of why they think this. Instead, they list a few benefits of computers, such as teaching hand-eye coordination and being useful for homework.

The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. For example, ""its"" should be ""it's,"" ""lof"" should be ""lot,"" and ""yor"" should be ""your.""

Furthermore, the student's argument is not well-supported. They claim that computers are necessary for homework, but they don't provide any evidence to back up this claim. They also make a contradictory statement by saying that people would be grumpy all the time if computers were taken away, but then they argue that people get enough exercise in school carrying heavy books.

To improve this essay, the student needs to work on developing a clear thesis statement, providing evidence to support their argument, and improving their grammar, spelling, and punctuation. They should also strive to use a more formal tone and organization.

Evaluation: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in a memoir, but their execution and analysis are somewhat limited. They have identified three key points that contribute to the mood created by the author: gratefulness and the author's perspective. However, their analysis is mostly superficial and lacks depth. The student relies heavily on direct quotes from the memoir, which is a good starting point, but they fail to provide a more nuanced explanation of how these quotes contribute to the overall mood. Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of parentheses and inconsistent capitalization.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the opposing viewpoint and consider the potential consequences of removing materials from the shelves.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, as described in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. The student has identified three main obstacles: public safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen, violent winds on top of the building, and an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. 

The student's analysis is well-supported by specific information from the excerpt, including the flammability of hydrogen and the potential for destruction caused by heavy weights dangling above pedestrians. However, the student could have benefited from providing more depth and detail in their explanation, as some of the points feel a bit superficial. For instance, the student could have explored the potential consequences of an accident involving hydrogen more thoroughly or discussed the specific laws and regulations that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.

Additionally, the student's writing is clear and easy to follow, with proper grammar and spelling. The student has also demonstrated the ability to summarize complex information from the excerpt in a concise manner. However, the writing could benefit from more varied sentence structure and vocabulary to make it more engaging and polished.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic of censorship in libraries and has provided a well-structured argument in support of their position. The essay begins with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student effectively uses examples from their own experience and observations to support their argument, including the idea that people may find certain materials offensive, and that others may find them inappropriate for younger generations.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the need for balance. They recognize that while some materials may be highly offensive, others may be able to be interpreted in different ways. The student also highlights the importance of individual rights and the need for people to have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or watch.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. At times, the writing can be a bit simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the sentence ""Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people"" could be more effectively phrased to convey a more nuanced understanding of the issue. Additionally, some of the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the student could benefit from using more varied sentence structures to create a more dynamic writing style.

Furthermore, while the student provides some strong examples, they could benefit from more specific and detailed analysis of these examples. For instance, when discussing the example of a book on how to rob a bank, the student could explain how this type of information could be used in real-life situations and why it would be problematic to have it available to the public.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the student demonstrates a good command of basic grammar and spelling, but there are some errors that could be improved upon. For example, the sentence ""They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing"" could be rephrased to ""They can choose to avoid that sort of thing"" to improve clarity.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific details from the narrative. The student correctly identifies the main character's decision to retake the test and connects it to the cyclical nature of the seasons, as exemplified by the geese's migration. However, the connection between the hibiscus plant and the main character's decision is not fully explored. The student also uses some vague phrases, such as ""things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again,"" which could be more specific and directly linked to the story.

The student's writing is clear and easy to follow, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""she had fond memories about the plant"" and ""she had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."" Additionally, the student uses some unfamiliar vocabulary, such as ""dok faeng – noi,"" which is not explained in the context of the story.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience, but it falls short in several areas. The writer's use of language and sentence structure is often unclear and lacks coherence. The essay starts with a vague statement about a time when the writer couldn't wait for a specific date, but it's unclear what the writer was waiting for. The writer then jumps to a scene where they receive gifts from their parents, but the narrative becomes confusing with repetitive phrases and unclear sentence structures.

The writer's attempt to demonstrate patience is also marred by their own impatience. The writer mentions being ""up and down"" and asking to open a gift, which contradicts the idea of being patient. Furthermore, the writer gets ""mad"" when their parents say no, which shows a lack of understanding and tolerance.

The writer's writing skills are also hindered by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and incorrect use of articles. The writer's use of capitalization is also inconsistent, with proper nouns and common nouns being capitalized randomly.

The essay could benefit from more clarity, coherence, and attention to grammar and mechanics. The writer should also strive to demonstrate patience in a more convincing and authentic way.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it requires significant improvement in terms of grammar, spelling, and coherence. The student has tried to share a personal experience related to patience, but the writing is marred by numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.

One of the major issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors. For instance, the student has used ""exprienced"" instead of ""experienced,"" ""caradable"" instead of ""carvable,"" ""considtrated"" instead of ""concentrated,"" and ""stomagh"" instead of ""stomach."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

Furthermore, the essay lacks coherence and clarity. The student has tried to include various details about the experience, but they are not well-connected and often seem unrelated. For example, the mention of the book and the organization's game seems out of place in the context of the essay. Additionally, the student has used colloquial expressions like ""we were a little caradable"" and ""we were crushing through the state of,"" which may be confusing for the reader.

In terms of content, the essay does touch on the idea of patience, but it is not explicitly stated. The student has tried to show patience through the experience, but it is not clearly explained. For instance, the student mentions that they ""didn't stop"" despite being bored and hungry, but it is not clear how this demonstrates patience.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They have provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, such as the stress added to the building's framework by a thousand-foot dirigible and the addition of two extra floors for an open observation platform and a boarding area. However, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and organization. The transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some sentences are worded awkwardly. Additionally, the student could have provided more analysis of the obstacles and their impact on the building's design.

For example, the student mentions that the architects wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, but they do not explain why this was a challenge or how it affected the building's design. Furthermore, the student states that the mast was ""doomed to never fulfill its purpose,"" but they do not provide evidence from the excerpt to support this claim.

The student's use of vocabulary and grammar is generally good, but there are some errors, such as the use of ""dirigidle"" instead of ""dirigible."" The student also uses some informal language, such as the phrase ""at the top of the Empire State building,"" which could be rephrased for more formal tone.

They could have explored the symbolism of the hibiscus plant in more depth and provided more specific examples from the text to support their claims.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks sophistication and depth.

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of the concept of patience, but their writing lacks depth and clarity. They have provided a clear definition of patience and given a relatable example of waiting in line for tickets to see a favorite band. However, their writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and simplistic sentence structures.

One of the major issues with the essay is the use of simplistic and vague language. Phrases such as ""without complaining or giving up"" and ""very respectful to yourself and others"" are not specific or detailed enough to convey a clear understanding of the concept of patience. Additionally, the student's writing lacks transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow their train of thought.

The student also struggles with grammar and spelling. There are several errors throughout the essay, including ""patienc"" instead of ""patience,"" ""lets"" instead of ""let's,"" and ""complaing"" instead of ""complaining."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand.

The student's use of examples is also limited and lacks depth. While the example of waiting in line for tickets is relatable, it is not a particularly nuanced or complex example of patience. The student also uses a simplistic and unrealistic example of a world without patience, which does not add much to their argument.

However, the student does show some understanding of the importance of patience and its benefits. They argue that patience is necessary for a harmonious world and that everyone could use a little more patience. This is a good starting point, but the student needs to develop this idea further and provide more evidence to support their claim.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary, as they rely heavily on simple phrases and sentences. Additionally, some of the sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. The student also uses informal language and colloquial expressions, such as ""veiws,"" ""waisting,"" and ""stick,"" which detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more nuanced and balanced arguments, acknowledging the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use. While they mention that computers can help with exercising, they could have also discussed the potential negative effects of too much screen time on physical health.

The student also repeats the same idea twice, which makes the response seem redundant.

The student's analysis is also limited to a single interpretation of the conclusion, which is that Saeng is a spring person and likes working in the garden during that time. While this is a plausible interpretation, it does not consider other possible meanings behind the conclusion. For example, the student could have explored how the conclusion relates to Saeng's emotional state or her relationship with the natural world.

In the story, the hibiscus is mentioned as ""budding"" in the spring, not in winter. Furthermore, the student does not consider the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus or the geese returning, which are crucial elements in the conclusion.

The student's analysis could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the author's intentions and the significance of the elements in the conclusion. For instance, the student could discuss how the author uses the spring season as a symbol of renewal and new beginnings, which is why the protagonist chooses to take the driving test at this time.

The essay attempts to describe a personal experience related to patience, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The writer starts by mentioning a doctor's appointment, but the narrative becomes disjointed as it jumps between checking in, waiting, and various tasks at the doctor's office.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. The use of short, simple sentences, such as ""I had to check-in at the desk,"" ""I had to sit and be patient,"" and ""I had to go to the check out desk,"" makes the text feel choppy and difficult to follow. Additionally, the writer uses phrases like ""and then I had to"" repeatedly, which can be considered a sign of a lack of varied sentence structure.

The writer does attempt to mention the concept of patience, stating that they had to ""be patient till the doctors called me back."" However, this sentence feels tacked on and doesn't fully integrate with the rest of the narrative. The writer also fails to provide any insight into how they felt during this experience or how it helped them develop patience.

Additionally, the writer could benefit from more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture in the reader's mind.

One notable strength of the essay is the writer's ability to connect the concept of patience to a personal experience. The writer effectively shows how they remained calm and didn't complain when they didn't get the video game immediately.

However, the writer could improve by providing more context and details about the experience. For instance, what was the name of the video game? How long did the writer have to wait? What were their feelings during that time? Providing more sensory details would make the experience more relatable and engaging for the reader.

Furthermore, the writer could work on varying sentence structure and using more complex sentences to convey their ideas.

Evaluation: The student provides a clear and concise explanation for why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. They effectively identify the connection between the winter season and the hibiscus plant's growth, which is a crucial element in the story. However, the student's analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific details from the text.

The student correctly points out that the story mentions the ""winter hibiscus"" and implies that it will start growing again in the spring. This is a good observation, but they could have further explored the significance of this detail and its connection to the story's themes. For instance, they could have discussed how the hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, and how the author uses the plant's growth to convey the main character's determination and resilience.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The essay is written mainly in simple sentences, which makes it seem a bit flat and lacks depth. Encouraging the student to use more complex sentence structures and transitions between ideas would help to strengthen their writing.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and examples to support their argument, which is a good approach for a middle school level essay. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to engage the reader with personal experiences and emotions. The writer's story about their half-sister and the use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Skype is relatable and helps to illustrate the benefits of computers in connecting people. Additionally, the writer's enthusiasm and excitement about learning new things on the computer are infectious and make the essay enjoyable to read.

However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The writer's writing style is often informal and lacks clarity, which makes it difficult to follow at times. The use of slang words and phrases, such as ""alot"" and ""man,"" detracts from the writer's credibility and makes the essay seem less polished. Furthermore, the writer's transitions between ideas are often abrupt, which disrupts the flow of the essay.

The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation. There are several errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and punctuation usage, which detract from the overall quality of the essay. For example, the writer uses the phrase ""I'll even tell you about these things"" in the second paragraph, which is a non sequitur and disrupts the flow of the essay.

In terms of content, the writer's argument could be strengthened by providing more evidence and examples to support their claims. While the writer mentions the benefits of computers in learning new things, they could have provided more specific examples of what they learned and how it benefited them. Additionally, the writer could have addressed the potential drawbacks of computers, such as the risk of addiction and social isolation, to provide a more balanced argument.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic of censorship in libraries and has provided a well-structured argument in support of their position. The essay begins with a relatable scenario that effectively grabs the reader's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student's use of rhetorical questions and personal anecdotes adds a touch of authenticity to their writing.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to think critically about the issue of censorship. They acknowledge that there may be a need for some level of censorship, particularly when it comes to protecting young children from explicit content. However, they also argue that censorship should be limited and not used to restrict adults' access to information.

The student's use of examples, such as the removal of a book about camels, is effective in illustrating the potential consequences of censorship. They also raise important questions about who should decide what is acceptable and who would be responsible for reviewing and censoring materials.

However, there are some areas where the student's writing could be improved. At times, the essay feels a bit disjointed, with ideas and sentences feeling disconnected from one another. Additionally, some of the language and phrasing could be more sophisticated. For example, the student uses the phrase ""truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment"" which could be rephrased as ""genuinely seeks out offensive content.""

Furthermore, the student could benefit from providing more evidence to support their arguments. While they raise some valid points, they could have strengthened their position by incorporating more examples or research to back up their claims.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing against its enforcement. The essay begins with a thought-provoking statement that sets the tone for the rest of the writing. However, the student's writing could benefit from more organization and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide personal experiences and observations to support their argument. For instance, they mention that children will still find ways to access inappropriate content despite censorship measures, such as music and movies. This shows that the student has given thought to the issue and is not just presenting a generic opinion.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the writing lacks transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. Additionally, the language and grammar are not always precise, with errors such as ""cencorship"" instead of ""censorship"" and ""nieve"" instead of ""naive."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more evidence to support their argument. While they mention the internet as a means of accessing information, they do not explore the implications of this in more depth. A more nuanced discussion of the role of the internet in shaping children's access to information would strengthen their argument.

Finally, the conclusion could be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement. The student's final sentence, ""censorship doesn'@CAPS1 be needed,"" feels somewhat abrupt and does not leave a lasting impression on the reader.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in relation to allowing dirigibles to dock. The writer has identified the main issue as a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to tie up to the building. The writer also mentions a publicity stunt that attempted to moor a dirigible to the building, but this idea was eventually shelved due to the unsolved problems of mooring airships at such a height.

However, the essay could benefit from more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support the writer's claims. For instance, the writer could have mentioned the specific height of the Empire State Building and how it posed a challenge for mooring airships. Additionally, the writer could have provided more context about the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, such as who enacted the law and when.

Furthermore, the writer's writing could be more polished, with more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Some sentences, such as ""The Idea of The mooring was shelved"" and ""The highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking Passengers, has never been open to The Public,"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion that computers have a positive effect on people. However, their writing lacks coherence and organization, making it challenging to follow their train of thought. The essay could benefit from a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion to provide a more structured argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples to support their claims. For instance, they mention using a computer to communicate with family and friends who live far away, which is a practical and relatable example. Additionally, they highlight the convenience of using a computer to look up information and work on tasks, which is a common benefit of technology.

However, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and a lack of proper punctuation. For example, ""I think that these reason will have you positive too"" should be ""I think that these reasons will have a positive effect on you too."" Similarly, ""you wouldent have to drive all the doun there"" should be ""you wouldn't have to drive all the way there."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to understand the student's intended message.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance. They present a simplistic view of the benefits of computers, without acknowledging potential drawbacks or counterarguments. For example, they mention that computers can help people work on tasks, but they don't consider the potential negative impact of excessive screen time on physical and mental health.

To improve their writing, the student should focus on developing a clear and concise thesis statement, organizing their ideas into logical paragraphs, and editing their work for grammar and punctuation errors. They should also strive to provide more balanced and nuanced arguments, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of computers.

The student has demonstrated a good effort in attempting to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the essay. Firstly, the student's use of vocabulary is limited, with words such as ""@CAPS1,"" ""@CAPS2,"" and ""@CAPS3"" being used instead of actual words. This makes it challenging to understand the intended meaning and creates a sense of informality. Additionally, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence, with sentences such as ""So @CAPS4 the end of the memoire @CAPS5 startes to talk about the @CAPS6 things like not Be able to find the kind or jod they deserved"" being difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the mood is not well-supported by specific examples from the memoir. While they mention that the mood is a mix of ""@CAPS1,"" ""@CAPS6,"" and ""alsomeness,"" they do not provide concrete evidence from the text to back up their claims. The student also uses phrases such as ""that way @CAPS1 mood there to"" and ""that not that much @CAPS6 thing @CAPS5 talk,"" which are unclear and do not contribute to a clear understanding of the mood.

The student also fails to consider the symbolic significance of the hibiscus in the story.

The essay on censorship in libraries presents a well-structured argument, but it requires refinement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer effectively introduces the topic by mentioning the quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the discussion on censorship. The essay then explores the idea that censorship is necessary to protect children from inappropriate content, but the writer also acknowledges the potential harm it can cause to authors and the limitation of knowledge for students.

Strengths:

1.  The writer provides a clear thesis statement, albeit indirectly, by stating that ""Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives.""
2.  The writer uses relevant examples, such as the impact of book banning on unknown authors and the importance of discussing books in a classroom setting.
3.  The writer attempts to consider multiple perspectives, including the need to protect children from vulgar content and the potential harm caused by censorship.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and direct thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the writer's argument at times.
2.  The writer jumps between ideas without providing a clear transition, making the essay feel disjointed.
3.  The writer relies heavily on vague terms, such as ""vulgar"" and ""innappropriate,"" without defining what these terms mean in the context of the essay.
4.  The writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims, relying on general statements and hypothetical scenarios.
5.  The conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Revise the thesis statement to be more direct and clear.
2.  Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and improve the flow of the essay.
3.  Define the terms used in the essay, such as ""vulgar"" and ""innappropriate,"" to provide a clear understanding of the writer's perspective.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, effectively conveying their opinion through a well-structured essay. The writer's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it?"" effectively engages the reader and encourages them to consider the issue from the student's perspective.

The essay's organization is logical, with the writer presenting three main arguments: the importance of individuality, the freedom of press, and the potential harm to the future. However, the writer could have benefited from more nuanced and detailed explanations to support these arguments.

One notable strength of the essay is the student's use of repetition, as seen in the phrase ""You should not ban books because..."" This repetition emphasizes the writer's main point and makes it more memorable for the reader. Additionally, the writer's use of transitional phrases, such as ""In conclusion,"" effectively signals the end of the essay and summarizes the main points.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more specific examples to support their arguments, such as citing a particular book that was banned and its impact on society. Furthermore, the writer's writing style is sometimes simplistic, with phrases like ""we have the freedom of press"" and ""we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want."" While these phrases are true, they could be more effectively expressed with more sophisticated language.

The writer's use of vocabulary is generally good, but there are some errors in grammar and punctuation. For example, the sentence ""If you ban books then you are giving up your indiviuality"" should be ""If you ban books, then you are giving up your individuality.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that people should not spend too much time on computers. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific reasons for their opinion, such as the importance of exercise, spending time outdoors, and interacting with friends.

The student also fails to address the opposing viewpoint, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing. While they mention that people can learn from books and school, they do not acknowledge the benefits of computers, such as teaching hand-eye coordination and allowing people to learn about faraway places and people.

The student's response to the prompt is brief and lacks clarity. The student attempts to explain why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph but fails to provide a coherent and well-supported argument. The student's reasoning is vague and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the story's themes and events.

The student mentions that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the protagonist, Saeng, thinks she will do better in the spring. However, this statement is not supported by any evidence from the story. The student also mentions that Saeng will be in a better mood in the spring, but this is not a clear connection to the story's conclusion. Furthermore, the student's statement that the spring will look more like her home place is unrelated to the story's themes and events.

The student's response lacks specific details and examples from the story to support their argument. The student does not demonstrate an understanding of the story's themes, such as the protagonist's emotional journey and her connection to her home. The student's response is also marred by grammatical errors and unclear sentence structure.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the stress added to the building's framework, the cost of modifications, and the violent air currents at the 1,050-foot altitude. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify and explain the main obstacles, including the structural issues, safety concerns, and legal restrictions. The student has also shown an understanding of the historical context, referencing the incident with the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs and a clearer thesis statement. Additionally, some of the sentences are worded awkwardly, and there are a few grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For instance, they could have explored the implications of the violent air currents on the building's design or the consequences of having weights suspended over pedestrians' heads.

Evaluation: 
The author concludes the story with the last paragraph to convey a sense of hope and determination in the face of failure. This conclusion effectively ties together the themes of perseverance and personal growth that are present throughout the narrative. 

The use of the phrase ""I will take that test again"" suggests that the protagonist, {PERSON}, has learned from her experience and is willing to try again, which is a crucial aspect of overcoming obstacles. This determination is reinforced by the seasonal imagery, where the ""spring"" and the ""geese return"" serve as a metaphor for new beginnings and renewal. The fact that the hibiscus is ""budding"" implies that even in the midst of adversity, there is always the potential for growth and change.

Furthermore, the use of the first-person narrative voice in the final sentence creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, drawing the reader into {PERSON}'s inner world and emphasizing the personal nature of her decision. This conclusion also raises questions about the nature of the test and what it represents, leaving the reader to ponder the significance of the protagonist's determination to retake it.

However, the conclusion could be strengthened by providing more context about the test and its importance to the protagonist. Additionally, the use of more descriptive language could help to create a more vivid image in the reader's mind.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a positive impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides several reasons to support their argument, including the access to information, entertainment, and job opportunities that computers offer.

Strengths:

1.  The student effectively uses transitional phrases to connect their ideas, making the essay easy to follow.
2.  They provide specific examples, such as online schools and colleges, to support their argument.
3.  The student acknowledges potential counterarguments, such as the concern that people spend too much time on computers, but does not fully address this point.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks depth and nuance in its analysis. The student primarily presents surface-level benefits of computers without exploring potential drawbacks or complexities.
2.  The writing is often simplistic and lacks varied sentence structure, which can make it seem juvenile.
3.  The student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""computers are beneficial to society,"" without providing concrete evidence to support these claims.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a story about a boy who learns the value of waiting for something he wants. However, the narrative is marred by several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of coherence. The writer struggles to express their ideas clearly, which detracts from the overall impact of the story.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the poor use of grammar and spelling. The writer frequently uses incorrect verb tenses, misspells words, and fails to use proper punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""But the was a sertant basketball he wanted"" should be ""But there was a certain basketball he wanted."" Additionally, the writer often uses simplistic sentence structures, which makes the text seem childish and lacking in sophistication.

Furthermore, the writer's attempt to explain the concept of patience is somewhat superficial. The definition provided by the boy's mom, ""it is a thing when you understand and tolerant,"" is vague and doesn't offer much insight into the complexities of patience. The writer could have delved deeper into the story to illustrate the boy's growth and understanding of patience.

The writer also struggles to create a cohesive narrative. The story jumps abruptly from the boy wanting a basketball to him being happy in high school, which doesn't provide a clear connection between the events. A more effective approach would be to show the boy's growth and development over time, rather than jumping to a conclusion.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against censorship, supported by relevant arguments and quotes from Katherine Paterson. The writer effectively uses the author's quote to emphasize the slippery slope of censorship, where one person's right to remove a book leads to the removal of all books. This is a strong point, as it highlights the potential consequences of censorship.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas, such as discussing the benefits of dividing the library into sections and the definition of censorship. While these points are relevant, they are not fully developed and disrupt the flow of the essay.

The writer also struggles with grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several errors throughout the essay, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and misspelled words. These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay and make it difficult to follow at times.

The writer's use of evidence is limited, and they rely heavily on the quote from Katherine Paterson. While the quote is effective, it would be beneficial to include more examples or personal anecdotes to support their argument. This would make the essay more engaging and convincing.

The writer's tone is generally clear, but there are moments where the language is simplistic or clichéd. For example, the statement ""where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?"" is a bit too vague and could be rephrased for more impact.

Overall, the essay shows promise, but could benefit from more development, organization, and attention to grammar and spelling.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance on the topic, arguing that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The student's position is based on the idea that individuals have the right to choose what they read, listen to, or watch, and that censorship in libraries should be minimal.

Strengths:

1.  The student starts with a relevant quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the essay and highlights the importance of individual freedom of choice.
2.  The student provides a clear thesis statement, stating that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive.
3.  The student uses personal experience to support their argument, sharing a story about seeing books with provocative titles as a child and understanding that they are meant for reading, not just looking at.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear structure, with ideas and sentences that seem disconnected and not well-organized.
2.  The student's writing is informal, with many grammatical errors, misspellings, and incomplete sentences.
3.  The student relies heavily on simplistic and vague statements, such as ""you should just walk away and ignore it"" or ""you should make a wise choice.""

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the writer's use of language is informal and lacks proper grammar and spelling. The frequent use of abbreviations, such as ""b/c"" for ""because"" and ""u"" for ""you,"" detracts from the overall clarity of the writing. Additionally, the writer often uses simplistic sentence structures, which can make the text seem childish. For instance, the sentence ""People have computer at they houses becous we and they need"" could be rephrased to ""People have computers at home because we and they need them."" This would improve the sentence's clarity and make it easier to understand.

Furthermore, the writer fails to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. While they mention that computers are important for learning and communication, they do not provide specific examples or details to back up this assertion. For example, they state that computers help people learn about important people, but they do not provide a specific example of how this is done.

The writer also struggles to organize their ideas coherently. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers to mentioning that some people do not have computers at home. A more logical flow of ideas would help to make the essay more engaging and easier to follow.

Finally, the writer's conclusion is somewhat unclear. They state that they know most families want to spend time together, but they need to think about their future and the importance of computers. However, this conclusion does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay or provide a clear call to action.

The essay attempts to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on society. However, it lacks a clear and focused thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer jumps between various points, such as the benefits of technology, the risks of viruses, and the stress-relieving qualities of computers, without providing a cohesive argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's enthusiasm for technology and its potential to improve society. The use of phrases like ""our society grows increasingly advanced"" and ""set our goals beyond reach"" showcases the writer's optimism about the impact of technology. Additionally, the writer highlights the educational benefits of computers, stating that they ""teach us and sometimes can guide you.""

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, such as the use of ""it's"" instead of ""its"" (e.g., ""has it's up and down's""), ""ups's"" instead of ""ups,"" and ""oppertunity"" instead of ""opportunity."" These errors detract from the writer's message and make the essay difficult to follow.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more concrete examples to support their claims. For instance, instead of stating that computers can ""get you away from all the stress in your life,"" the writer could have described a specific situation where technology helped them manage stress.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis statement, providing more specific examples to support their claims, and editing their work to eliminate grammatical errors.

However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific examples from the text. The student correctly identifies the author's nostalgia for his childhood but fails to consider the complexity of the mood, which might be a mix of nostalgia and appreciation for his family's selflessness. The student also shows a good understanding of the author's tone, describing it as loving and admiring towards his parents. However, the analysis could be more nuanced, considering the author's perspective and the impact of his experiences on his emotions.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of personal opinions and experiences to support their argument. For instance, the student states, ""You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it."" This shows that the student has thoughtfully considered the issue and is not simply regurgitating information. Additionally, the student's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned?"" effectively engages the reader and encourages them to consider the topic.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but there are areas that need improvement in terms of writing quality and coherence. The student has attempted to provide a story about patience, but it lacks a clear and concise narrative. The essay jumps abruptly from one scene to another, and the transitions between sentences are not smooth.

One of the strengths of the essay is that it includes a relatable scenario where the main character, @CAPS5, is frustrated with her younger brother @PERSON1's slow pace during a game of Sorry. However, the student could have explored this scenario further to demonstrate the concept of patience more effectively.

The student's use of dialogue is a good attempt, but it feels forced and unnatural at times. For instance, the phrase ""I'm so sorry @PERSON1! So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry"" seems to be a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow of the story.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind. For example, instead of saying ""@CAPS5 was getting extremely angry,"" the student could have described the emotions and physical reactions of @CAPS5 in more detail.

In terms of grammar and mechanics, the essay has several errors, including subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and capitalization mistakes. For instance, the sentence ""She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 â€œ@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about?

The essay attempts to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence. The writer starts by stating that they were patient, but the context is unclear. The sentence ""my mom when to the doctors and she was having a baby"" is grammatically incorrect and seems to be missing a verb. The phrase ""I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour for???."" is also incomplete and lacks a clear purpose. It appears that the writer is trying to describe a situation where they were patient, but the details are not well-developed.

The use of ""when"" instead of ""went"" and the missing verb in the first sentence make it difficult to understand the writer's intended meaning. Additionally, the sentence ""I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour for???."" is unclear because it lacks a clear purpose or outcome.

The writer could have also benefited from more descriptive language and sensory details to help the reader visualize the situation. For example, they could have described the waiting room, the people around them, or their own feelings and thoughts while waiting.

Evaluation:

The student has attempted to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people, but their essay lacks coherence, clarity, and proper grammar. The writing is informal, and the tone is somewhat aggressive, which may not be suitable for a formal letter to a newspaper. The student uses colloquial expressions and slang, such as ""necessarily,"" ""nessesary,"" ""i,"" and ""trust me,"" which detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's argument is centered around the idea that computers are bad for people's health, particularly in terms of weight gain. However, the examples provided are anecdotal and lack concrete evidence to support the claim. The student's personal experience with a friend who is overweight is used to illustrate the point, but it is not a convincing argument. The student also fails to acknowledge the potential benefits of computers, such as teaching hand-eye coordination and allowing people to learn about faraway places and people.

The student's writing lacks organization and transitions between paragraphs. The ideas are not clearly connected, and the essay jumps abruptly from one topic to another. The student also uses repetitive language, such as ""I believe that"" and ""I think that,"" which makes the writing seem monotonous.

The student's use of vocabulary is limited, and the language is often simplistic. The student uses phrases such as ""big fat,"" ""heart breaking,"" and ""terrible,"" which are not suitable for a formal essay. The student also uses capitalization incorrectly, capitalizing random words and phrases throughout the essay.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay provides specific information from the excerpt, such as the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, which led to concerns about the potential consequences of a dirigible catching fire on the building. The student also mentions the impact of violent air currents and the danger of lead weights snapping off and falling to the pedestrians below.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more detailed and nuanced explanations of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, the student could have discussed how the builders attempted to mitigate the risks of spontaneous combustion or how they might have adapted to the changing winds. Additionally, the student could have provided more evidence from the excerpt to support their claims, rather than relying on general statements.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. Many of the sentences are simple and lack transition words or phrases to connect ideas. The student could also benefit from more precise language, as some of the sentences contain vague terms such as ""many obstacles"" or ""the law.""

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir but falls short in providing a clear and well-supported analysis. The student starts by stating that the mood is ""happy,"" but fails to provide sufficient evidence from the memoir to support this claim. The mention of the author's childhood, Cuban food, and music is a good starting point, but the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""verry"" instead of ""very"" and ""hapily"" instead of ""happily."" Additionally, the sentence structure is simplistic and lacks coherence.

The student also uses informal language, such as ""injoyes"" instead of ""enjoys,"" which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Furthermore, the student fails to provide specific details from the memoir to support their claim, relying on vague statements like ""the unity of his invirorment"" instead of providing concrete examples.

The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The student provides several examples to support their argument, such as the ability to communicate with loved ones across the globe, learn about foreign places, and access information about tourist attractions.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""fascinating synthetics"" and ""lively planet we call earth"" seem out of place and may not accurately convey the intended meaning. Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity.

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of subject-verb agreement errors, and the use of commas is inconsistent. For example, in the sentence ""What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people,"" the comma after ""country"" is missing.

Furthermore, the student could benefit from more nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the topic.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, but it could be improved in several areas. The writer attempts to connect the concept of patience to a personal experience, but the narrative is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity. The writer jumps between different scenes and characters, making it challenging to follow the story.

One of the strengths of the essay is the writer's ability to use specific details to illustrate the concept of patience. For example, when describing the speech competition, the writer mentions that their friend was nervous and had too much cologne on, which shows that the writer is trying to convey the idea that patience is necessary in situations where people are anxious or uncertain.

However, the writer's use of language and grammar is not always accurate. There are several spelling and punctuation errors throughout the essay, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, the writer uses the phrase ""alittle bit"" instead of ""a little bit,"" and fails to use proper capitalization in certain places.

Furthermore, the writer's conclusion is somewhat confusing. The writer states that having patience is a good thing, but then immediately contradicts this statement by saying that people can't have patience when they want to become friends. This inconsistency undermines the writer's argument and makes the conclusion feel abrupt.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the setting affects the narrator in the given text. They have provided specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion, which is a commendable effort. However, there are areas where the student could improve to elevate their writing quality.

Firstly, the student could have provided a clearer and more detailed explanation of how the setting affects the narrator. For instance, when discussing the heat, they mention that it makes the narrator uncomfortable and thirstier, but they could have elaborated on how this discomfort affects the narrator's mood or behavior. Additionally, the student could have provided more quotes or examples to support their points, making their argument more convincing.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more precise and accurate language. For example, when referring to the road, they say it is ""rolling hills,"" but this is not an exact quote from the text. They could have used the actual quote from the text to support their point. Also, the student could have used more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to express their ideas.

Lastly, the student's conclusion could be more effective if they had provided a clearer summary of the main points and a more explicit statement about how the setting affects the narrator. This would help the reader understand the student's argument more clearly.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that nothing should be censored from the shelves. They provide a balanced perspective, acknowledging that some individuals may find certain materials offensive, while others may see them as a form of artistic expression. The student's use of a personal anecdote about a book on {PERSON1} is a good attempt to support their argument, as it highlights the importance of having access to comprehensive information.

However, the essay could benefit from more development and organization. The student jumps between ideas without providing a clear structure or logical flow. For instance, the transition from discussing the benefits of uncensored materials to mentioning the potential benefits of censorship feels abrupt. Additionally, the student's suggestion to provide both clean and explicit versions of music albums is an interesting idea, but it is not fully explored or explained.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some areas where grammar and punctuation could be improved. For example, the sentence ""On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The writer attempts to identify the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but the response is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and a failure to provide specific information from the excerpt.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clarity in the writer's thoughts. The sentences are often fragmented and difficult to follow, making it challenging to understand the writer's argument. For instance, the first sentence, ""The obstacles the engineers faced were that Of Any @CAPS1 builder,"" is unclear and does not provide any specific information about the obstacles. The writer then jumps to discussing the sturdiness of the frame and payroll for the engineers, which are not directly related to the prompt.

The writer also fails to provide specific information from the excerpt to support their claims. While they mention Al Smith, they do not provide any relevant details about how he addressed the challenges of the mooring mast. The writer's statement that Al Smith ""did not run into the @CAPS2 Problems"" is also unclear and does not provide any context.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is informal and lacks precision. For example, the phrase ""how high is to high wind conditions"" is grammatically incorrect, and the writer's use of ""agood idea"" is a colloquialism that detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The student's analysis is on the right track, but they could have delved deeper into the significance of the final paragraph and its connection to the rest of the story.

They could have also explored how the mother's gesture of planting the hibiscus represents a second chance for Saeng, and how this moment is a turning point in the story.

Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples from the text to support their claims. For example, they could have mentioned how Saeng's initial failure on the test is contrasted with her determination to try again, as evident in the final paragraph. They could have also discussed how the author's use of sensory details, such as the sound of Saeng whispering the names of the plants, contributes to the emotional impact of the story.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar and punctuation.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, arguing that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves simply because they are found offensive. The student provides several examples from personal experiences and observations to support their position.

Strengths:

1.  The student effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate their point, making the essay more relatable and engaging. For instance, they mention a friend who gets offended by movies that portray black characters in a negative light, and a magazine that makes people feel insecure about their appearance.
2.  The student attempts to consider multiple perspectives, acknowledging that some people might be offended by certain materials, but also highlighting the importance of not removing everything that might be considered offensive.
3.  The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of censorship and its potential consequences, such as the removal of valuable resources that could help people.

Weaknesses:

1.  The student's writing lacks clarity and coherence at times, with some sentences being fragmented or difficult to understand. For example, the sentence ""So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better comprehension.
2.  The student's arguments could be more developed and supported with evidence. While they provide some personal anecdotes, they could benefit from incorporating more research or expert opinions to strengthen their position.
3.  The student's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and could be more effectively linked to the rest of the essay. A more polished conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis statement would be beneficial.

The student's use of quotes from the memoir is a good start, but they could have analyzed these quotes more thoroughly to explain how they contribute to the overall mood.

For example, when discussing the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" the student could have explained how this sentence creates a sense of nostalgia and sadness, and how it contrasts with the happy memories that the author is trying to hold onto. Similarly, when discussing the sentence ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture,"" the student could have explained how this sentence creates a sense of admiration and respect for the author's parents, and how it contributes to the overall mood of the memoir.

The student's statement that the girl in the story is ""almost like the flower itself"" is an interesting observation, but it could be further developed with more evidence from the text.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic of censorship in libraries, as evident from their essay. They have provided examples of books, music, and movies that have been banned or restricted due to their content. However, the student's writing lacks clarity, coherence, and organization, which affects the overall impact of their argument.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear thesis statement. The student jumps abruptly from discussing book censorship to music and movies, without a clear connection between the ideas. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought and understand their main argument.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, misspellings, and informal language. For instance, the use of ""Cencorship"" instead of ""Censorship"" and ""sutable"" instead of ""suitable"" detract from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the student's use of phrases such as ""I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out"" is informal and not suitable for a persuasive essay.

The student's use of examples is also somewhat superficial. While they mention specific books, music, and movies that have been banned, they do not provide a nuanced analysis of the issues surrounding censorship. For instance, they simply state that ""Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it"" without exploring the complexities of the issue.

Despite these limitations, the student shows some potential in their writing. They demonstrate a willingness to engage with the topic and provide some thoughtful insights, such as the idea that people need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.

The writer attempts to use rhetorical devices, such as metaphors (""it will be alot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it"") and allusions (""@CAPS3 will be much easier and less @CAPS2 if we sometimes deal with the difficullt @CAPS3 in @CAPS4""), although they may not be executed perfectly.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument.
2.  The writer jumps between ideas and transitions between paragraphs can be smoother. For instance, the transition from the personal experience to the general statement about people having different interests is abrupt.
3.  The writer could benefit from more evidence to support their argument, such as examples of books or materials that have been challenged or banned in the past, and how these challenges have affected the community.
4.  The writing could be more polished, with fewer grammatical errors (""Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going,"" ""diffrernt looks about different @CAPS3 in this way of @CAPS4"") and more varied sentence structures.

The essay attempts to address the prompt about patience, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and engaging narrative. The story is brief and does not provide sufficient details for the reader to visualize the scene. The writer fails to establish a connection between the events and the concept of patience, making it difficult to understand how the experience relates to the definition of patience.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is simple and lacks variety. The sentence structure is basic, and there is no attempt to use descriptive language or vivid imagery. The writer also fails to provide a clear resolution or conclusion to the story, leaving the reader with a sense of abruptness.

Additionally, the writer's use of the phrase ""I was still not calming down"" is unclear. It is not evident what the writer was trying to calm down from, and the phrase seems to contradict the initial statement of being patient. The writer also fails to provide any insight into their dad's behavior or how he handled the situation, which could have added depth to the story.

The writer does attempt to show patience in the story, but it is not explicitly stated. The writer mentions waiting for the next person to go, which is a demonstration of patience, but it is not clearly connected to the definition provided in the prompt.

The student has attempted to provide a thoughtful analysis of the concluding paragraph of the story. However, their response lacks clarity and depth, making it challenging to fully understand their reasoning. The student mentions two possible reasons for the author's conclusion but fails to provide concrete evidence from the story to support their claims. 

The student suggests that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it might mean that the main character, {PERSON}, can only take the test in the spring. This is a plausible interpretation, but the student does not provide any evidence from the story to support this claim. The student also mentions that the main character's surroundings during the spring period are relaxed, which is an interesting point, but it is not directly related to the conclusion of the story.

Furthermore, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""it could mean she can only take the test in the spring"" (should be ""it could mean that she can only take the test in the spring"") and ""heR"" (should be ""her""). Additionally, the student's use of the phrase ""@CAPS1"" is unclear and seems to be a mistake.

The student has attempted to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir, but their response lacks depth and specific details from the text. The student's understanding of the author's emotions seems to be based on general assumptions rather than evidence from the memoir. The student mentions that the author is remembering a ""really good time"" and is ""happy for having a good childhood,"" but fails to provide specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support this claim. The student also uses vague terms like ""sad"" and ""happy"" without explaining how these emotions are conveyed through the author's writing.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt by presenting their stance on censorship in libraries. However, the writing lacks clarity, coherence, and effective organization. The student's argument is based on a personal experience with a magazine, but it is not well-supported or developed. The essay relies heavily on simplistic statements and lacks concrete evidence to back up the claim that offensive materials should be removed from library shelves.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise writing. The student uses short, fragmented sentences that make it difficult to follow their argument. For instance, the sentence ""If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone"" is unclear and contains several grammatical errors. The student also fails to provide a clear thesis statement, making it challenging to understand the main argument.

The student's use of evidence is also limited and not effectively integrated into the essay. The anecdote about the magazine being removed from the shelves is an interesting example, but it is not developed or analyzed in any meaningful way. The student simply states that they argued with the librarian for five minutes and the magazine was removed, but this does not provide any insight into the complexity of the issue.

Furthermore, the student's argument relies on a simplistic and binary view of censorship. They suggest that materials should be removed if they are ""offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs,"" but this does not account for the nuances of free speech and the importance of intellectual freedom. The student also fails to consider the potential consequences of censorship, such as the suppression of diverse perspectives and ideas.

To improve this essay, the student should focus on developing a clear and well-supported argument, using more complex and nuanced language, and providing concrete evidence to back up their claims. They should also consider multiple perspectives on the issue and address potential counterarguments.

The essay provides a good attempt at describing the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The writer mentions that the author's story creates a mood that makes the reader think about themselves and their family, but this is a vague statement and does not provide specific evidence from the memoir to support this claim. 

The writer does attempt to provide some specific information from the memoir, such as the author's discussion of his family, neighborhood, and love of music. However, the writer's analysis of these points is often superficial and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of how these elements contribute to the mood of the memoir. For example, the writer states that the author's discussion of his family and neighborhood ""makes you think about your self and your family,"" but does not explain why this is the case or what specific details from the memoir support this interpretation.

Furthermore, the writer's writing is often marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles. The writer also uses simplistic sentence structures and relies heavily on vague phrases, such as ""He also talkes about..."" and ""He also uses music to simbolize his life.""

The student mentions that the geese came back and the girl was happy, but this is a simplistic interpretation that does not fully capture the significance of the final paragraph.

The student could have provided more insight by analyzing the symbolism of the geese and the hibiscus plant in the story. For example, the geese returning could represent a new beginning or a second chance, which is reinforced by the girl's decision to take the test again in the spring. The hibiscus plant, which is budding, could symbolize growth and renewal. By considering these elements, the student could have provided a more nuanced explanation for why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, effectively conveying their opinion through a well-structured essay. The writer's use of personal anecdotes and observations adds depth to their argument, making it more relatable and engaging.

Strengths:

1.  The student has taken a clear stance on the topic, arguing against censorship in libraries, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing.

The essay demonstrates a clear attempt to express the writer's opinion on the effects of computers on people. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the importance of computers in everyday life, particularly in the workplace. The use of examples, such as parents working on computers while the writer was young, effectively conveys the writer's point that computers are a necessary tool for many jobs.

However, the essay lacks coherence and organization. The writer jumps between different ideas, such as the benefits of computers in the workplace, the internet, and online social media, without a clear transition between paragraphs. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is informal and lacks proper grammar and spelling. The use of phrases such as ""Most people east, sleep, and drink computer"" and ""they need to be senting work to other companies over sea's"" demonstrate a lack of attention to detail and a need for improvement in writing mechanics.

The writer also fails to address the opposing viewpoint, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing. The essay could be strengthened by acknowledging the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use and providing a more balanced argument.

Furthermore, the writer's use of statistics, such as ""ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs,"" is not supported by evidence and may be exaggerated. The writer also uses colloquial expressions, such as ""you can just go on you computer and chechk the news,"" which detract from the overall professionalism of the essay.

In terms of content, the writer provides some interesting points, such as the ability to watch TV and movies online and the convenience of buying music and other items online. However, these ideas are not fully developed and could be explored further.

The student's analysis of the grateful mood is somewhat accurate, as they mention the family's good fortune in moving to a new location.

However, the prompt specifically asks for a story about patience, which involves understanding and tolerance in the face of difficulties. The writer's narrative about the horse's impatience does not align with the prompt's requirements.

2.  The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their argument, such as the example of a child accessing a Playboy magazine in the youngster's section.
3.  The student also explores the potential consequences of censorship, suggesting that it could lead to a lack of access to information and ultimately contribute to societal problems.
4.  The writer attempts to address the issue of freedom of expression, stating that people should be able to choose what they read, watch, and listen to.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to follow the writer's argument at times.
2.  The writer relies heavily on personal opinions and anecdotes, which, while effective, could be strengthened with more evidence and research to support their claims.
3.  The essay jumps between different topics, such as movies, magazines, and music, without a clear connection between them, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought.
4.  The writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to improve clarity and engagement.

Suggestions for improvement:

1.  Develop a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the essay and guides the reader through the writer's argument.
2.  Incorporate more evidence and research to support the writer's claims, such as statistics, expert opinions, or historical examples.
3.  Organize the essay to focus on a specific aspect of censorship, such as the impact on children or the role of libraries, to create a more cohesive argument.
4.  Edit the writing to improve sentence structure, vocabulary, and clarity, making it easier for the reader to follow the writer's ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's conclusion, but their analysis could be more in-depth and detailed. They correctly identify the main reason for the protagonist's decision to retake the test, which is related to her school work and the blooming flowers. However, their explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks specific examples from the story to support their claims.

The student mentions that the protagonist is looking forward to springtime, but they do not provide any evidence from the text to support this statement. A more thorough analysis would involve referencing specific details from the story, such as the image of the hibiscus budding, to explain the protagonist's emotional connection to the season.

Furthermore, the student could have explored the symbolism of the hibiscus and its connection to the protagonist's determination to retake the test. The story implies that the hibiscus represents a new beginning and a chance for the protagonist to start anew, which is a more nuanced interpretation that the student could have explored.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of mood in the memoir and has provided some relevant examples to support their answer. However, there are areas where the analysis could be more in-depth and specific. The student has identified the mood of belonging, comfort, and gratitude, which are all present in the memoir. They have also provided quotes that illustrate these moods, such as ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" and ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" 

However, the student could have delved deeper into the analysis by exploring how these moods are created through the author's use of language, imagery, and tone. For instance, they could have discussed how the use of words like ""warm home"" and ""endless celebrations"" contribute to the sense of comfort and belonging. Additionally, they could have analyzed how the author's tone, particularly in the statement ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" conveys a sense of gratitude.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific examples from the memoir to support their analysis. For example, they could have discussed how the author's description of his parents' sacrifices, such as leaving everything behind when they immigrated to {LOCATION1} from Cuba, contributes to the sense of gratitude.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, the essay could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and use of specific details from the excerpt. 

The student starts by stating that building a docking mast for dirigibles is a difficult task, which is a good starting point. However, the explanation that follows is somewhat vague and lacks specific information from the excerpt. The student mentions consulting with experts, touring equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in {LOCATION}, and meeting with the president of an airship transport company, but these points are not clearly connected to the main idea of the essay.

The student also mentions that the construction workers had to modify the frame of the building, which is a crucial point, but the explanation is not entirely clear. The student states that the modification required over sixty thousand dollars, but this information is not directly related to the docking mast. Furthermore, the student mentions that construction was halted due to the danger of pedestrians, which is not supported by the excerpt.

To improve the essay, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt, such as the challenges of building the docking mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building, and how the builders came up with a solution to modify the building's frame. The student could also have provided more clarity on how the meetings with experts and the president of the airship transport company contributed to the solution.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, expressing their opinion on the benefits of technology and its impact on society. They have provided some valid points, such as the ability to discover new things through media, the advancement of the music industry, and the convenience of staying updated on current events through television. However, their argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete evidence and addressing the opposing views more effectively.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use transitional phrases and connect their ideas logically. For instance, they transition smoothly from discussing the benefits of technology to the music industry and its economic benefits. Additionally, they use rhetorical questions to engage the reader and make their points more relatable.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are simple and lack depth, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as statistics or personal anecdotes.

The student also struggles with grammar and punctuation at times. There are several instances of missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. These errors can make the essay difficult to follow and detract from the student's overall message.

In terms of content, the student could have addressed the opposing views more effectively.

The student has attempted to provide a clear explanation of why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. However, their response lacks depth and clarity. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the give plans,"" ""show is all gone,"" and ""etcs."" Furthermore, the student's use of the phrase ""the author @MONTH1"" is unclear and seems to be a reference to a specific month, but it is not relevant to the context of the paragraph.

The student's analysis is also somewhat superficial, as they only mention the geese and the hibiscus flower as reasons for the author's conclusion, without exploring the deeper meaning behind these elements. For example, the student could have discussed how the geese and the hibiscus flower serve as symbols of renewal and hope, which is a central theme in the story.

The essay provides a clear and concise explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the desolate landscape the cyclist encounters. For instance, the phrase ""run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert"" effectively conveys the bleakness of the environment, which in turn affects the cyclist's emotional state. The use of words like ""sad,"" ""hopeless,"" and ""laugh"" emphasizes the cyclist's despair and desperation.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's physical and emotional state. The writer mentions dehydration but does not fully explore its effects on the cyclist's body and mind. Additionally, the transition between the cyclist's despair and newfound hope feels abrupt, and more explanation of the significance of ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp"" would strengthen the essay.

The writer also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. For example, the sentence ""He says, “It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.”"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors.

The student has also identified the contrast between the cyclist's initial amusement and later frustration, which is a key aspect of the setting's impact on the cyclist.

The use of abbreviations and incomplete sentences, such as ""?? my little brothers and my two cousins"" and ""she said she would pay me if I would?? them,"" makes it difficult to follow the story.

The student's writing also lacks descriptive language and vivid details, which are essential for engaging the reader.

Additionally, the use of phrases like ""A couple days were my mom???(@CAPS1) @CAPS2 turned out piclity good for me after all"" is unclear and may be a result of a grammatical error.

However, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of patience, as they mention that a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. This understanding is evident in the student's attempt to describe a situation where they had to be patient.

Evaluation: The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. They seem to be exploring different ideas, but fail to provide a clear and focused explanation of why the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""It some thing personely"" and ""She trying to say,"" which detract from the overall quality of the response.

The student's first idea, that the paragraph is important to the author because it is something personally about Saeng, is an interesting one, but it is not fully developed. The student could have explored this idea further by analyzing specific details from the story that suggest why Saeng's past or her place of origin is significant to her. For example, the student could have mentioned the fact that Saeng is willing to wait until spring to take the test again, which suggests that she is not ready to move on from her past or her old life.

The student's second idea, that Saeng is going to plant something in the spring, is not supported by the text. The paragraph actually suggests that Saeng is going to take the test again, not plant something. This confusion suggests that the student may not have fully understood the content of the paragraph.

4.  The writer provides a clear and concise thesis statement at the end of the essay, summarizing their argument against censorship.

Weaknesses:

The writer effectively uses descriptive language and vivid details to bring their memories to life, making the reader feel like they are part of the story. The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion that ties everything together.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to convey the writer's emotions and feelings towards their grandfather. The writer's love and appreciation for their grandfather are palpable throughout the essay, and the use of specific anecdotes and memories helps to create a sense of intimacy and connection. The writer also does a great job of showing, not telling, the importance of laughter in their relationship, rather than simply stating it.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as some of the sentences are quite simple and repetitive. Additionally, there are a few places where the writer could have expanded on their ideas or provided more context to make the story even more engaging. For example, the writer mentions that their grandfather was a barber shop owner, but doesn't elaborate on what that meant for their relationship or how it impacted their interactions.

The writer also struggles with grammar and punctuation at times, with a few instances of missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and run-on sentences. While these errors do not detract from the overall impact of the essay, they do make it harder to read and understand in some places.

Finally, the writer could have benefited from more attention to detail in their use of transitions and connections between paragraphs. While the essay flows generally well, there are a few places where the writer jumps abruptly from one idea to another without providing a clear connection.

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt, but the essay lacks depth and clarity. The writer fails to provide a clear and well-supported explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay relies heavily on vague statements and lacks specific examples to support the claim. 

The student mentions that the high deserts of California in June create a high intensity level in the story, but this statement is not developed further. The writer also mentions that a different date would change the story, but this is a vague and unsubstantiated claim. The essay could be improved by providing more specific examples and explanations of how the setting affects the cyclist.

For instance, the writer could have discussed how the heat and dryness of the desert environment might affect the cyclist's physical condition, or how the scenery of the desert landscape might influence the cyclist's mood or perspective. The writer could also have explored how the time of year (June) might impact the cyclist's experience, such as the presence of heatwaves or the blooming of certain plants.

The writer's use of the phrase ""make the intensity level of the story very high"" is also unclear. What does the writer mean by ""intensity level""? Is it the physical difficulty of the ride, the emotional impact of the experience, or something else? The writer should have provided more context and explanation to clarify this point.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear opinion on the effects of computers on people. The essay is well-structured, and the writer has used transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to provide specific examples of how computers are beneficial, such as video chatting with relatives and using the internet for information. The writer also acknowledges the potential drawbacks of excessive technology use, such as spending too much time on devices and losing touch with family and friends.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and clarity. The writer jumps between ideas and sometimes uses vague language, such as ""it can slowly us the human race down."" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes.

The writer also struggles with using proper capitalization and spelling, as seen in the use of ""@CAPS1,"" ""@CAPS2,"" and ""@CAPS3."" This suggests a lack of attention to detail and a need for more proofreading.

To improve, the writer should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. They should also work on providing more concrete evidence to support their claims and organizing their ideas in a more logical and coherent manner.

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt, but their response could be improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and depth of analysis. The student mentions that the setting affects the cyclist, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion. 

The student mentions that the aridity of the climate and the lack of water are problems for the cyclist, but they do not provide a clear explanation of how these features of the setting specifically impact the cyclist. Additionally, the student states that the scorching sun would make the cyclist become dangerously dehydrated, but this is not supported by any evidence from the essay. 

To improve, the student could have provided more specific examples from the essay to illustrate how the setting affects the cyclist.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the story. The essay provides specific examples from the narrative to support the conclusion, showcasing the student's ability to analyze and connect the setting to the character's experience.

The student effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting, such as ""lifeless and most importantly, waterless"" and ""water tasting like 'battery acid'."" These descriptions help to create a sense of tension and hardship, which is consistent with the student's argument that the setting affects the cyclist's journey.

However, the essay could benefit from more depth and analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotions and actions. For example, the student could explore how the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign affects the cyclist's confidence or how the empty juice factory tempts him.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, effectively arguing that computers have a positive impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides specific examples to support their claims, such as the benefits of hand-eye coordination, online research, and social interaction.

However, there are areas for improvement. The student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. Phrases such as ""one of technology's greatest"" and ""sweeping the nation, as well as the world"" are a bit generic and could be replaced with more precise language. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""So if you use a computer, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out.""

The student also relies heavily on vague statistics, such as ""over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers"" and ""@PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games."" Providing specific numbers or credible sources to support these claims would strengthen the argument.

The essay attempts to convey the concept of patience through a personal anecdote, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that ties the story to the concept of patience. The narrative jumps abruptly from the student's experience with their dad to a separate instance involving @PERSON1, which makes it challenging to follow and understand the connection to the prompt.

The essay also fails to provide a detailed description of the events, making it difficult to visualize the situation. For instance, the student mentions waiting for their dad to put gas in the dirt bike, but the context and emotions involved are not explored. Similarly, the story about @PERSON1 is brief and lacks any emotional depth.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to engage the reader. The use of simple sentences and basic vocabulary limits the essay's impact. Additionally, the essay could be improved by providing more insight into the student's thoughts and feelings about patience, rather than simply stating that a person was patient.

However, the essay does attempt to address the prompt by highlighting the importance of waiting and being understanding, which is a key aspect of patience. The student also demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept by providing examples from their personal experience.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt by explaining how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's emotions and physical state. The student has provided some vivid descriptions of the setting, such as the ""ghost town,"" ""ramshackle shed,"" and ""tumbleweeds,"" which effectively convey the cyclist's growing unease and desperation.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of sensory details to describe the setting, which helps the reader visualize the cyclist's journey. For example, the phrase ""rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds"" effectively conveys the harsh and unforgiving nature of the environment. The student also does a good job of showing how the setting affects the cyclist's emotions, particularly his confidence and hope. The sentence ""Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out"" effectively illustrates the cyclist's emotional state.

However, the essay could benefit from more analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist's physical state. While the student mentions that the cyclist is ""dehydrated and losing all hope,"" the essay could delve deeper into how the setting contributes to this physical state. Additionally, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother, and the essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between ideas.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt and has provided a clear and concise analysis of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student has effectively identified the emotions of gratitude, admiration, and love that are present in the memoir and has provided specific examples from the text to support their claims.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use quotes from the memoir to illustrate their points. For example, when discussing the author's gratitude for his parents, the student quotes the line ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude,"" which effectively conveys the depth of the author's emotions. Similarly, when discussing the author's admiration for his family, the student quotes the words ""selfless and hardworking"" to demonstrate the author's positive feelings.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. At times, the essay feels a bit simplistic and lacks depth. For example, the student states that the author's descriptions of his parents' feats and hardships ""convey his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader."" While this is true, it would be more effective if the student could elaborate on how the author's descriptions specifically convey this feeling. Additionally, the student could benefit from providing more analysis of the author's use of language and literary devices to create the mood.

Furthermore, the student could improve their writing by varying their sentence structure and using more complex vocabulary. For example, the sentence ""Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir"" could be rephrased to be more concise and engaging.

The essay starts with a clear statement of the topic, but the organization and structure of the essay are not well-developed. The student jumps between ideas without connecting them logically, making it difficult to follow their argument.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar and spelling. There are numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout the essay. For example, ""exersize"" should be spelled as ""exercise,"" ""eyesite"" should be spelled as ""eyesight,"" and ""adicting"" should be spelled as ""addicting."" These errors make the essay difficult to read and understand.

The student also struggles to provide supporting evidence for their claims. While they mention some potential negative effects of excessive computer use, such as addiction, lack of exercise, and eye strain, they do not provide any concrete examples or statistics to back up these claims. Additionally, the student's writing lacks depth and nuance, failing to consider multiple perspectives on the issue.

The student's writing also lacks proper transitions and connections between ideas. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the addictive nature of computers to the negative effects on physical health. A more effective essay would have used transitional phrases or sentences to connect these ideas and create a more cohesive argument.

Despite these challenges, the student shows some potential in their writing. They are able to express their opinion clearly and concisely, and they demonstrate a basic understanding of the topic.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, arguing that certain materials should be removed from shelves to protect children from offensive content. The essay begins with a thought-provoking question that encourages the reader to consider the potential impact of objectionable materials on children. However, the writing could benefit from more cohesion and organization.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's use of personal experience and observations to support their argument. The statement ""Nothing is censored like it was back in the day"" effectively conveys the idea that the current lack of censorship contributes to the prevalence of violence and bad attitudes among children. Additionally, the student highlights the importance of libraries as a place for learning and suggests that removing offensive materials would be a step towards creating a safer environment for children.

However, the essay could be improved in several areas. Firstly, the writing lacks transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. The ideas are not fully developed, and some sentences seem disconnected from the rest of the essay. For instance, the sentence ""Schools could help prevent this problem by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries"" feels like a non-sequitur and could be integrated more smoothly into the previous paragraph.

Furthermore, the student's use of language and grammar is not always accurate. For example, the sentence ""Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be protected from bad materials"" contains a grammatical error, and the phrase ""thats how the generation is today"" should be ""that's how the generation is today."" Additionally, the student could benefit from using more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to convey their ideas.

Lastly, the conclusion feels abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. The student could have rephrased the final sentence to provide a more satisfying conclusion.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and attempts to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir.

The student relies heavily on a single example from the memoir to support their claim, which may not be sufficient to establish a comprehensive understanding of the mood. Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary and sentence structure is basic, which affects the overall clarity and coherence of the essay.

The student correctly identifies the mood as ""proud"" and provides a relevant quote from the memoir to support their claim. However, the analysis of the quote is limited to a surface-level interpretation, and the student fails to explore the context and nuances of the author's message. For instance, the student mentions that the author's parents ""were the richest people either,"" which seems to be an error or an inaccuracy, and does not contribute to the analysis of the mood.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks transitions and connections between ideas, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. The use of phrases such as ""I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that"" is also awkward and detracts from the overall quality of the essay.

The student also uses informal language, such as ""Surely this effect could be very serious,"" which is not suitable for a formal essay.

The student's use of evidence is also limited. While they provide a quote from a student who studies computer mechanics, it is unclear whether this is a credible source. Furthermore, the student relies heavily on general statements, such as ""Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks time the person brain could be damaged.""

Firstly, the student has provided specific quotes from the memoir to support their answer, which is a good practice. The quote ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" effectively conveys the theme of sacrifice and love, which is a key element in creating a powerful mood. 

However, the student's analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. They mention feeling ""love and thoughtfulness"" and ""admiration"" but do not explain how these emotions are created by the author's use of language or literary devices. For example, they could have discussed how the author's use of words like ""selflessly"" or ""incredible"" contribute to the mood.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. The transition between paragraphs is abrupt, and the sentences are often short and simplistic. For instance, the sentence ""This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does"" is a good start, but it could be developed further to provide more insight into the student's thoughts and feelings.

Furthermore, the student's use of language is sometimes imprecise. For example, they use the phrase ""put me in her shoes,"" which is a common idiom, but it would be more effective to use more descriptive language to convey the idea that the author has created a sense of empathy in the reader.

The student has identified some of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, but their analysis is not thorough and lacks specific details from the excerpt. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of clear and concise sentences. The student has used short, fragmented sentences that make it difficult to follow their train of thought. For example, ""The @CAPS1 Had to modify and strengthen the building to Accommodate the new situation."" This sentence could be rephrased to make it clearer and more concise.

One of the strengths of the essay is its attempt to connect patience with a personal experience, which is a good approach to making the concept more relatable. However, the writer could have benefited from more descriptive language and sensory details to bring the reader into the scene.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to address the prompt, but it lacks clarity and coherence in its writing. The student has tried to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the ideas are not well-developed and are often disconnected from each other. The use of transitions and connections between sentences is limited, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use vivid imagery to describe the cyclist's experience. For example, the sentence ""He was riding real fast through the short cut"" effectively conveys the sense of speed and freedom that the cyclist feels. Similarly, the phrase ""he came over a long, crippling hill"" effectively conveys the sense of challenge and difficulty that the cyclist faces.

However, the essay would benefit from more specific and detailed analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist. For instance, the student mentions that the cyclist feels ""free"" when riding, but does not explain why this is the case or how the setting contributes to this feeling. Additionally, the student jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's experience on the road to making a statement about the cyclist's future, which feels disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical and mechanical errors, such as the use of ""real"" instead of ""really"" and the lack of punctuation in some sentences. These errors detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response is incomplete and lacks clarity. The essay fails to provide a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The only example provided, ""the condition of his jar,"" is vague and does not effectively support a conclusion. The student could have explored other features of the setting, such as the terrain, weather, or time of day, to demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

The student's writing also lacks proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The sentence structure is simple and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of how to effectively organize ideas. The use of the phrase ""one example is"" is a weak transition and does not provide a clear connection between the example and the rest of the essay.

To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear and concise thesis statement, supporting it with specific examples, and demonstrating a better understanding of grammar and sentence structure.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt to identify the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and effective use of textual evidence. 

The student correctly identifies the mood as grateful and happy, which is a positive tone. They provide specific examples from the text, such as the quote from paragraph six, to support their claim. However, the analysis of the quote is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. The student simply states that the quote shows the author's gratitude without explaining how the language or context of the quote contributes to the overall mood.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions and connections between ideas is limited. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the author's gratitude towards parents to mentioning neighbors, without providing a clear link between the two ideas. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow.

Additionally, the student's use of vocabulary and sentence structure is basic, which may make the essay seem less engaging and less polished. For example, the sentence ""He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" is unclear and contains grammatical errors.

The essay provides a clear and concise thesis statement that effectively identifies the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, the analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific examples from the memoir. The student mentions the grateful sense of the mood but fails to explain how the author achieves this mood through specific language, imagery, or events described in the memoir.

The student correctly identifies a quote from the memoir, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love,"" which suggests a positive and appreciative tone. However, the student could have analyzed this quote further to explain how it contributes to the overall mood of the memoir.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The student has identified three main reasons: safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen, the impact of changing winds, and the illegality of airships flying low over urban areas. However, the essay could benefit from more detailed and specific information from the excerpt to support these claims.

The student correctly quotes a statement from the article, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" However, this quote is not directly related to the obstacles faced by the builders. The student should have provided more relevant information from the excerpt to support their claims.

The student's explanation of the safety concerns is partially correct, stating that hydrogen is highly flammable, but they fail to mention that helium is a safer alternative. The mention of changing winds is a good point, but it could be more specific and detailed. The student also correctly identifies the illegality of airships flying low over urban areas as a reason, but they should have provided more context or information from the excerpt to support this claim.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and lack of proper punctuation. The use of ""thats"" instead of ""that's"" is a notable error. Additionally, the sentence structure could be improved for better clarity and coherence.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of patience, but their writing skills need improvement. The essay lacks coherence and clarity, with several grammatical errors and misspellings. The student has attempted to provide examples of situations where patience is necessary, but the explanations are brief and lack depth.

One of the main issues with the essay is the inconsistent spelling of the word ""patient."" The student has used different variations of the word, including ""paceint,"" ""pacient,"" and ""pacint."" This suggests a lack of attention to detail and a need for proofreading.

The student's examples of patience are mostly related to everyday situations, such as cooking cookies and playing games. While these examples are relevant, they are not well-developed and lack specific details. For instance, the student mentions waiting in a waiting room, but does not explain why patience is necessary in this situation.

The student's writing also lacks variety in sentence structure and vocabulary. Many of the sentences are short and simple, which makes the essay feel flat and unengaging. Additionally, the student relies heavily on basic vocabulary, such as ""you have to be patient"" and ""it takes a long time.""

To improve their writing, the student should focus on proofreading their work for spelling and grammar errors. They should also strive to provide more detailed and specific examples of patience, and use a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary to make their writing more engaging.

The essay is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and effective use of transitional phrases. The writer provides specific examples from personal experiences to support their claims, which adds credibility to their argument.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to address potential counterarguments. They acknowledge the concerns about excessive screen time and eye damage, but effectively counter these points by highlighting the benefits of computers, such as communication with family and friends, learning about other cultures, and research opportunities.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which can make the text seem a bit flat. Additionally, some sentences, such as ""Computers are a more positive thing than negative,"" feel like a conclusion without much supporting evidence.

The use of specific examples and personal anecdotes is a strength, but the student could have taken it a step further by providing more depth and analysis. For instance, they mention using the computer to research, but could have elaborated on the specific skills they learned or the projects they worked on.

They have provided specific examples from their personal experience and observations to support their arguments, such as the book ""To {CAPS3} a {CAPS4}"" and the impact it had on them. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence.

One of the primary issues with the essay is the lack of a clear and logical structure. The student jumps between different topics, such as books, music, and magazines, without a clear transition between paragraphs. This makes it difficult to follow the student's train of thought and understand their arguments. Additionally, the use of slang and informal language, such as ""tuff,"" ""thats,"" and ""mkae,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's arguments could be strengthened by providing more evidence and supporting details. For instance, when discussing the impact of music on young people, they could have provided specific examples of songs or artists that they believe are setting a bad example. Similarly, when discussing the benefits of magazines, they could have provided more specific examples of the types of informative facts and articles that they find valuable.

The student also shows a good understanding of the issue of censorship and its impact on individuals, particularly young people.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic of censorship in libraries, effectively using persuasive language to argue against the removal of books and other materials from shelves. The essay begins with a thought-provoking quote from Katherine Paterson, which sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writer skillfully uses rhetorical questions and vivid imagery to emphasize the importance of freedom of speech and the potential consequences of censorship.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to use personal experiences and observations to support their argument. For instance, when discussing the impact of censorship, the writer asks the reader to imagine a world where influential books like {CAPS4} are locked away, highlighting the potential loss of valuable perspectives and ideas. This approach helps to engage the reader and makes the argument more relatable.

The student also demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of freedom of speech and its significance in a democratic society. They effectively argue that censorship can be used to suppress diverse opinions and stifle creativity, leading to a world without direction or progress. The writer's use of examples, such as the controversy surrounding the {CAPS1} series and the impact of {ORGANIZATION1} on children, adds depth to their argument.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from more cohesive transitions between paragraphs, as some ideas seem to be disconnected. Additionally, the writer could have provided more specific examples to support their claims, such as citing instances of books or authors that have been censored in the past.

Furthermore, the student could have taken a more nuanced approach to addressing the issue of children's access to certain materials.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of commas. For example, ""Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early"" should be ""My friends and I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 early."" Additionally, ""alot"" should be spelled as ""a lot.""

The student also struggles with sentence structure and organization. The essay jumps between different ideas without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow. For instance, the paragraph about the bus being late and the example of a team scoring a goal seem unrelated to the main idea of patience.

Despite these challenges, the student shows some understanding of the concept of patience and its different aspects. They mention that patience can be both good and bad, and that it requires mental peace. However, the examples provided are not well-developed and lack supporting evidence.

To improve, the student should focus on developing their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and punctuation. They should also work on organizing their ideas and providing clear transitions between paragraphs. Additionally, they should provide more detailed and relevant examples to support their arguments.

The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear thesis statement or a logical structure to support their claims. The essay jumps abruptly from discussing the advice of old men to the road conditions and then to the hot weather, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought.

The writer does attempt to provide some specific examples from the setting, such as the presence of tumbleweeds and a large snake on the road, which could potentially impact the cyclist's experience. However, these examples are not effectively connected to the overall argument and lack depth in their explanation. For instance, the writer mentions that the hot weather leads to dehydration, but they do not elaborate on how this affects the cyclist's performance or well-being.

Furthermore, the writer's use of language is informal and lacks precision. Phrases such as ""ridiculously large snake"" and ""come into play"" detract from the overall quality of the essay. The writer also fails to use transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas, making the essay feel disjointed.

The student has attempted to provide a thoughtful analysis of the author's decision to conclude the story with the given paragraph. However, their response lacks clarity and specific details from the story to support their claim. The student's statement that the paragraph represents a ""new start"" for the protagonist is somewhat vague and does not directly relate to the events of the story. 

The student also makes a statement that the protagonist has had a ""hard time"" and that she will ""alway have hard times,"" but this is not supported by the provided paragraph or the story as a whole. The paragraph actually suggests that the protagonist is looking forward to a new opportunity, as indicated by her vow to take the test again in the spring when the hibiscus is budding. This implies that she is hopeful and optimistic about her future, rather than resigned to a life of hardship.

To improve their analysis, the student could have provided more specific examples from the story to support their claims. For instance, they could have discussed the protagonist's initial failure on the test and how this experience has motivated her to try again. They could also have analyzed the symbolism of the hibiscus and the geese returning in the spring, and how these elements contribute to the sense of renewal and new beginnings.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's tone and has attempted to identify the mood created by the author. However, there are several areas where the student's analysis could be improved. Firstly, the student has identified the emotions of love, appreciation, and unity as the primary moods created by the author, but could have provided more specific examples and quotes to support their claims. For instance, the student mentions that the author expresses love for his culture, but fails to provide a detailed explanation of how this is demonstrated in the text.

The student also struggles with grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For example, the sentence ""Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture"" contains a grammatical error, and the phrase ""he stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music"" is unclear. Additionally, the student uses informal language and colloquial expressions, such as ""he talks alot"" and ""tended to stick together,"" which is not suitable for formal writing.

Furthermore, the student could have provided a more nuanced analysis of the author's use of language and literary devices to create the mood. For instance, the student mentions that the author talks about the aromas of the kitchen, but fails to explain how this sensory detail contributes to the overall mood of the memoir.

The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist. However, the essay lacks depth and supporting details to make the argument more convincing. The student has provided some relevant examples, but they are not fully developed and lack specific evidence from the text to support the claims.

The student correctly identifies that the cyclist had limited water, had to pedal harder to get up hills, and was getting dehydrated from the heat. However, the explanation for why the cyclist had limited water is not entirely clear, as it is stated that he took directions from the old men, which is not directly related to the setting. A more effective explanation would be to describe how the setting, such as the terrain or the time of day, contributed to the cyclist's limited water supply.

The student also mentions that the cyclist had to pedal faster and harder to get up the rolling hills, which is a good point. However, the explanation for how this affected the cyclist is brief and lacks specific details. For example, the student could have described how the cyclist's exhaustion from pedaling harder impacted his overall performance or well-being.

Furthermore, the student correctly identifies that it was a June day and that the heat contributed to the cyclist's dehydration. However, this point is not fully developed, and the student could have provided more specific details about how the heat affected the cyclist, such as how it made him feel or how it impacted his ability to pedal.

To improve this essay, the student could provide more specific and detailed examples from the text to support their claims. They could also develop their explanations and provide more analysis of how the setting affected the cyclist.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist. However, there are areas where the writing could be improved to make it more effective and cohesive. 

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to describe the physical effects of the desert setting on the cyclist, such as the blistering sun, heat, and sweat. For example, the sentence ""The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles"" effectively conveys the intensity of the heat. Additionally, the student provides a clear example of how the heat affects the cyclist's physical state, stating ""The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy."" This shows that the student can analyze the impact of the setting on the character.

However, there are some areas where the writing could be improved. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the physical effects of the setting to mentioning the elderly men giving terrible directions. This transition feels disconnected from the rest of the essay and could be clarified. Furthermore, the student could have provided more specific details about how the directions affected the cyclist's journey. 

The student also uses some simplistic sentence structures and vocabulary, which may make the writing seem less engaging. For instance, the sentence ""If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammar. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and the cyclist's experience.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the setting affects the cyclist in the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" The student has provided specific examples from the essay to support their conclusion, which is a strong aspect of their writing. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, and clarity.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to describe the negative effects of the setting on the cyclist. For instance, the student mentions that the ""unbearable heat"" and ""crippling"" hilly terrain reduce the cyclist to a ""stale of severe dehydration."" This shows that the student can analyze the setting and its impact on the character. Additionally, the student provides a vivid description of the cyclist's isolation, stating that there was ""no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind"" for over ""@NUM1 miles of arid desert."" This helps the reader visualize the situation and understand the cyclist's plight.

However, the student's writing could benefit from more attention to grammar and sentence structure. For example, the sentence ""Obviously not exactig a positive effect"" is a grammatical error, and the student could have rephrased it to ""clearly, the setting was having a negative effect."" Additionally, some sentences are wordy and could be condensed for better clarity. For instance, the sentence ""The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply"" could be broken up into two separate sentences for easier reading.

Furthermore, the student could have provided more analysis of the setting and its impact on the cyclist. While they mention the negative effects, they could have explored why the setting is significant to the narrative and how it contributes to the overall theme.

However, the analysis of the memoir's mood could be more in-depth and supported by more specific details from the text. The student primarily focuses on the positive aspects of the author's life, which is accurate, but fails to consider potential counterarguments or nuances that could have added depth to the analysis.

The student correctly identifies the author's positive tone and mentions specific examples, such as the love for cooking and the author's gratitude for it. Additionally, the student notes the author's description of the neighborhood as a place where ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship,"" which effectively conveys a sense of community and warmth.

However, the student could have explored the author's use of language and literary devices to create the mood. For instance, the student could have analyzed how the author's descriptions of the neighborhood and the author's family life contribute to the overall positive mood.

The essay provides a clear and relatable example of patience through the writer's personal experience with their old teacher, @PERSON1. The writer effectively conveys @PERSON1's patient nature by describing specific situations where he remained calm and understanding, even when faced with challenging students. The use of phrases such as ""explained a million times"" and ""got attitudes"" effectively illustrates the writer's perspective and creates a vivid image in the reader's mind.

However, there are areas for improvement. The writer could have provided more details about the specific situations where @PERSON1 demonstrated patience, making the story more engaging and concrete. Additionally, the writer could have explored the impact of @PERSON1's patience on the writer and their classmates, adding depth to the narrative.

Furthermore, the writer's writing style is simple and lacks variety in sentence structure. The use of short, basic sentences, such as ""He was a very patient man,"" could be improved by incorporating more complex sentence structures and descriptive language. The writer also uses informal language, such as ""we got on his nerves"" and ""we got attitudes,"" which may not be suitable for formal writing.

Lastly, the writer's conclusion feels abrupt, with the sentence ""I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin"" feeling somewhat disconnected from the rest of the essay.

Evaluation:

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a mixed bag of ideas and arguments. On one hand, the student attempts to address the prompt and provide their perspective on censorship. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its effectiveness.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps between ideas without a clear structure, making it challenging to follow their train of thought. For instance, the student starts by stating that they believe in censorship but then immediately contradicts themselves by saying it's ""not that big of a deal."" This inconsistency sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing is plagued by grammatical errors, misspellings, and poor sentence structure. Phrases like ""I do belive in censorship"" and ""I have never found a book and readed it"" demonstrate a lack of attention to detail and proofreading. These errors detract from the student's credibility and make it difficult to take their arguments seriously.

In terms of content, the student's arguments are somewhat superficial. They rely on general statements, such as ""if it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it."" However, they fail to provide concrete examples or supporting evidence to back up their claims. The student also struggles to articulate a clear position on censorship, vacillating between supporting and opposing it.

The student's use of vocabulary and sentence-level writing is also a concern. Phrases like ""some things are not ment to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a yonger age"" demonstrate a lack of sophistication and clarity. The student's writing would benefit from more varied and precise language.

Despite these criticisms, the student does attempt to engage with the prompt and provide some thoughtful ideas. They recognize that censorship should be used judiciously and for a good reason, such as protecting children from graphic content. This shows that the student is capable of thinking critically about the issue.

The essay starts with a clear thesis statement, stating that computers have a positive effect on people. However, the supporting paragraphs are disorganized and lack specific examples to back up the claims.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of proper grammar and spelling. There are several instances of misspelled words, such as ""possitive"" instead of ""positive,"" ""electronics"" instead of ""electronic devices,"" and ""alaphabet"" instead of ""alphabet.""

The student also struggles to provide a clear conclusion, instead repeating their initial statement that computers have a positive effect on people. A more effective conclusion would have summarized the main points and re-emphasized the writer's stance.

Evaluation: 
The student's essay attempts to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the student uses incorrect grammar and spelling, which makes it challenging to understand their intended message. For instance, the phrase ""affects in his journy"" should be ""effects on his journey."" Additionally, ""he hills"" should be ""the hills,"" and ""enerf"" should be ""enough."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's writing lacks clarity and coherence. The transition between ideas is abrupt, and the sentences are short and simplistic. For example, the sentence ""The other one was water, the lack of water"" is unclear and could be rephrased to provide a more logical connection to the previous idea.

However, the student does attempt to address the prompt by mentioning the effects of hills and water on the cyclist. The statement ""it used most of his energy and slowed him down"" is a good example of how the features of the setting (hills) can affect the cyclist. Similarly, the idea that ""a boost"" from having enough water would have helped the cyclist is a reasonable conclusion.

To improve, the student should focus on refining their writing skills, including grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. They should also work on providing more detailed and logical connections between ideas.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, but their essay lacks depth and clarity in addressing the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The student starts by mentioning the importance of wind in air and sea vehicles, which is a relevant point. However, they fail to provide specific information from the excerpt to support their claim. The student also introduces a new idea about changing wind speeds and direction being a huge threat, but this is not directly related to the excerpt. 

Furthermore, the student's argument is weakened by the mention of the law preventing dirigibles from floating at low altitudes, which is not supported by the excerpt. This seems to be an assumption made by the student rather than a conclusion drawn from the text.

The student's writing is also marred by informal language and a lack of coherence. The use of phrases such as ""its game over"" and ""downright cool"" detract from the overall quality of the essay.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity, coherence, and supporting evidence. The essay starts with a vague statement about the features of the setting affecting the cyclist, but fails to provide a clear explanation or connection to the examples provided. The student mentions dehydration and the road causing bike malfunctions, but these points are not well-developed or supported with specific details.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as ""the road my cause bike to stop working"" (should be ""the road may cause the bike to stop working"") and ""the guy could get dehydrated easily"" (should be ""the cyclist could get dehydrated easily""). Additionally, the sentence structure is simplistic and lacks variety, making the text difficult to follow.

The student attempts to provide examples from the setting, such as the lack of water in the desert and the intense heat, but these are not effectively connected to the main idea of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept that the features of the setting can affect the cyclist. However, the essay lacks clarity, coherence, and proper grammar, which hinder the overall impact of the argument. The student's writing is also marred by several errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the student's ability to identify the setting as a hot summer day in California and how it affects the cyclist. The student writes, ""It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike."" This sentence effectively conveys the harsh conditions the cyclist faces. Additionally, the student highlights the cyclist's lack of preparation for the route, stating, ""The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route."" This shows an understanding of how the setting can impact the cyclist's experience.

However, the essay is weakened by several issues. The student's writing is often unclear, with sentences such as ""His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date."" The use of ""instincts"" instead of ""instinct"" and ""was"" instead of ""wasn't"" creates confusion. Furthermore, the student's use of colloquial expressions, such as ""meschy bottle of water"" and ""moth,"" detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay.

The student also struggles with coherence, as the essay jumps abruptly from discussing the cyclist's decision to take the shortcut to the consequences of that decision. A clearer transition between these ideas would improve the essay's flow.

The essay presents a clear and well-defined opinion on the negative effects of excessive computer use on society. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and expert opinions to support their argument, making the essay engaging and relatable. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

Strengths:

1.  The writer takes a clear stance on the issue, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing.
2.  The use of personal anecdotes, such as the interview with the eye doctor, adds a touch of authenticity to the essay.
3.  The writer effectively uses rhetorical questions, such as ""It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer,"" to engage the reader and encourage action.

Weaknesses:

1.  The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement, making it difficult to understand the writer's main argument.
2.  The writing is often informal and lacks proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. For example, ""I belive"" should be ""I believe,"" and ""deing"" should be ""dying.""
3.  The writer relies heavily on sensational and extreme examples, such as a child killing people and getting shot by a cop, which may not be credible or relevant to the topic.
4.  The essay lacks supporting evidence from credible sources, making it difficult to take the writer's argument seriously.
5.  The writer's tone is often condescending and judgmental, which may alienate the reader.

The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting can affect a cyclist. However, the writing lacks depth and clarity in its explanation. The student has attempted to address the prompt, but the ideas are not well-developed and lack supporting evidence. 

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps between different ideas without connecting them logically. For instance, the transition from discussing dehydration to the effect of the sun on vision feels abrupt. The student could have used transitional phrases or sentences to link these ideas together.

Furthermore, the student's writing could benefit from more specific and detailed examples. The statement ""what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape"" is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of how this affects the cyclist. The student could have provided a more concrete example, such as ""if the road is full of potholes, it can cause the cyclist to lose control of their bike.""

Additionally, the student's writing contains some grammatical errors and lacks proper punctuation. For example, the sentence ""One way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike"" is unclear and contains a run-on sentence.

Evaluation: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the story's theme and the significance of the final paragraph.

Additionally, the student has correctly interpreted the symbolism of the natural events mentioned in the final paragraph, such as the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus, as indicators of rebirth and new beginnings.

However, the student's analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. For instance, they could have explored how Saeng's attachment to the hibiscus plant is not just about her homeland but also about her sense of identity and belonging. Furthermore, they could have delved deeper into how the final paragraph serves as a turning point in the story, marking Saeng's decision to overcome her obstacles and retake the test.

The student's writing is clear and concise, but it lacks specific textual evidence to support their claims.

The essay demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has identified three obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, which are safety hazards, nature itself, and a law restricting airships from flying low above urban cities. However, the student's analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth.

Firstly, the student's understanding of the safety hazards is limited to a single quote from the excerpt, which is not entirely relevant to the topic. The quote mentions the destruction of the Hindenburg, but it does not directly relate to the Empire State Building. A more accurate analysis would have explored the specific safety concerns related to airships docking at the Empire State Building.

Secondly, the student's discussion of ""nature itself"" as an obstacle is vague and lacks specific examples. The student mentions that winds would make an airship go around like crazy, but this is not a clear or convincing argument. A more effective analysis would have provided concrete evidence from the excerpt to support this claim.

Lastly, the student's discussion of the law restricting airships from flying low above urban cities is accurate, but it is not well-supported by the excerpt.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear and relatable argument, but it requires improvement in several areas to reach its full potential. The writer effectively uses personal experiences and observations to support their stance on the issue, which is a commendable approach for a middle school student.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to connect the issue of censorship to a real-life scenario, making it more engaging and accessible to the reader. The writer's personal experience of witnessing students not returning books and the subsequent struggles of their junior class to complete their term paper effectively illustrates the consequences of not having access to necessary materials. This narrative approach helps to build a sense of empathy and understanding in the reader.

However, the essay could benefit from more organization and coherence. The writer jumps between ideas and sentences, making it challenging to follow the logical flow of the argument. For instance, the transition from discussing overdue fees to involving parents in the process feels abrupt. A clearer structure and more transitional phrases would enhance the essay's overall clarity and persuasiveness.

Additionally, the writer's writing style is informal, with several grammatical errors and misspellings. While this is not uncommon for middle school students, it's essential to encourage more attention to detail and proofreading to improve the overall quality of the writing.

The writer's argument against censorship is also somewhat unclear. While they argue that everyone should have access to books and materials, they fail to address the issue of potentially offensive content. The quote from Katherine Paterson at the beginning of the essay hints at this concern, but it's not fully explored in the essay. A more nuanced discussion of the complexities surrounding censorship would strengthen the writer's position.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured, and the student has provided specific information from the excerpt to support their answer. However, there are some areas that need improvement.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has identified three main obstacles: the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, violent air currents, and the safety hazard posed by hydrogen-filled dirigibles. The student has also provided relevant quotes from the excerpt to support their points, which shows that they have read and understood the text.

However, there are some areas where the student could improve. Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement that sets out the main argument. The student starts by stating that the builders faced obstacles, but it is not clear what they are trying to argue or prove. A stronger thesis statement would help to guide the reader through the essay and provide a clearer direction.

Secondly, the student could provide more analysis and explanation of the obstacles they have identified. For example, when discussing the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, the student could explain how this law affected the builders' plans and what they could have done to overcome this obstacle. Similarly, when discussing the safety hazard posed by hydrogen-filled dirigibles, the student could explain why this was a particular concern and what the consequences of an accident could have been.

Finally, the student could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures. The essay is written mainly in simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat and lacking in depth. Using more complex sentence structures and varying the length of the sentences could help to create a more engaging and dynamic essay.

The student's essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against removing books and other materials from shelves if they are deemed offensive. The writer effectively uses personal opinions and experiences to support their argument, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the essay is marred by several issues that hinder its overall effectiveness.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The student's use of grammar, spelling, and punctuation is often incorrect, making it challenging to follow their train of thought. For instance, the sentence ""No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin"" is a jumbled mix of words that conveys a confusing message. Similarly, the sentence ""What's a child without it's @CAPS1?"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.

Another issue is the student's reliance on personal opinions and anecdotes, which, while relevant, are not always well-supported or effectively integrated into the essay. The writer mentions that some offensive materials are ""part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now,"" but fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to back up this claim. Additionally, the student's use of rhetorical questions, such as ""What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive?"" feels like a forced attempt to persuade rather than a genuine inquiry.

The student also struggles to address potential counterarguments, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing. While they acknowledge that some people might be offended by certain materials, they do not provide a thoughtful response to this concern. Instead, they simply assert that ""no one should"" be complaining about the books and materials.

The student's essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks clarity and coherence. The writer seems to be trying to convey that the author of the story has a positive relationship with the place, but the explanation is marred by grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, and a lack of specific details from the story. The student mentions that the author likes working with people and seeing his life come back, but these points are not directly connected to the last paragraph of the story. The writer also incorrectly states that the author does not like the place, which contradicts the evidence from the story. The student could have strengthened their argument by analyzing the last paragraph more closely and providing more specific examples from the story to support their claims.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of how the features of the setting can affect the cyclist in the given scenario. The essay effectively highlights the challenges faced by the cyclist due to the hot weather, lack of water, poor road conditions, and the presence of a snake. However, the writing could be improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of specific examples to support the conclusion. For instance, the student mentions that the water tastes like ""battery acid"" when it's hot, which effectively conveys the cyclist's frustration and discomfort. Additionally, the student provides a clear explanation of how the poor road conditions affect the cyclist's speed, stating that he can only travel at 12 mph.

However, the essay could benefit from more detailed explanations and transitions between ideas. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the hot weather to the poor road conditions, without providing a clear connection between the two. Furthermore, some sentences are quite short and lack supporting evidence, such as the statement that the snake is a setback. To improve the essay, the student could provide more context and details about the snake's encounter.

The student's writing also shows some grammatical errors, such as the use of the phrase ""he is travelling through a desert in California in June"" which could be rephrased to ""he is traveling through a desert in California in June"" to maintain consistency in verb tense. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""he cannot find any other water himself"" could be rephrased to ""he cannot find any other water"" to make the sentence more concise.

The essay provides a clear explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it could be improved with more detailed and specific examples. The writer effectively uses quotes from @PERSON1 to support their points, which helps to create a sense of authenticity and engagement. However, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance its overall clarity and coherence.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to describe the physical challenges faced by the cyclist in the setting. For example, when @PERSON1 mentions ""having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable,"" it effectively conveys the physical toll of dehydration on the cyclist. Additionally, the description of the terrain as ""short, rolling hills"" after a ""flat road"" effectively highlights the physical demands of the journey.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more specific details about the setting and its impact on the cyclist. For instance, the writer mentions the ""high deserts of California in June,"" but does not elaborate on how the heat and dust affect the cyclist's body. Furthermore, the writer could have explored the emotional and psychological effects of the setting on the cyclist, such as feelings of isolation or frustration.

To take the essay to the next level, the writer could also vary sentence structures and vocabulary to create a more engaging and dynamic writing style. For example, instead of using simple sentences like ""Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable,"" the writer could use more complex sentences that incorporate more descriptive language, such as ""The lack of water not only made @PERSON1 weak and unstable but also left them feeling parched and desperate for relief.""

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a negative impact on society. However, the essay lacks a structured and organized approach to presenting their argument. The writer jumps between various points, including environmental concerns, financial waste, and security risks, without providing a clear connection between them.

One of the strengths of the essay is the use of personal anecdotes and quotes from family members and a local resident, which adds a sense of authenticity and relatability to the argument. The writer also attempts to use rhetorical devices, such as allusions to the environment and the economy, to emphasize the negative effects of computers.

However, the essay is marred by grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and a lack of coherence in sentence structure. The writer often uses simplistic language and relies on colloquial expressions, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and balanced arguments, as the writer presents a one-sided view of the issue.

The essay attempts to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but it falls short in several areas. Firstly, the essay lacks clarity and coherence, making it challenging to understand the author's intended message. The writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as ""it's about family culture and how I'd be in a house with your family friends,"" which should be rewritten as ""it's about family culture and how I'd be in a house with your family and friends."" Additionally, the essay contains several spelling mistakes, including ""outhor"" instead of ""author,"" ""ond"" instead of ""and,"" and ""olwoys"" instead of ""always.""

Furthermore, the essay fails to provide specific and relevant information from the memoir to support the author's claim about the mood created by the author. The text mentions Narciso Rodriguez's parents keeping their door open to people they considered family, but it does not explain how this action contributes to the mood of the memoir. The essay also lacks depth and analysis, simply stating that Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to his parents and that he likes being with his neighborhood.

The essay could be improved by providing more specific examples from the memoir to support the author's claims and by addressing the grammatical and spelling errors. The author should also strive to create a more cohesive and clear writing style.

The student has made an effort to express their opinion on the topic, but their writing lacks clarity, coherence, and organization. The essay is written in a conversational tone, which is suitable for a letter to the editor, but it requires improvement in terms of sentence structure and grammar.

One of the strengths of the essay is that the student has identified three valid points to support their argument: the potential negative effects of excessive computer use on physical health, the limitations of computers in teaching certain skills, and the risk of becoming too attached to technology. However, these points are not developed thoroughly, and the student fails to provide concrete evidence or examples to support their claims.

The student's writing is also marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and spelling mistakes. For instance, the sentence ""Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght & start to lose control over the eating habits"" is unclear and contains several errors. Similarly, the sentence ""Whats sometimes different with a computer"" is grammatically incorrect.

To improve the essay, the student should focus on developing their ideas, providing evidence to support their claims, and revising their writing to eliminate grammatical errors. They should also work on varying their sentence structure and using more complex vocabulary to make their writing more engaging.

Furthermore, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The writing appears to be a collection of disconnected sentences rather than a cohesive piece of writing.

The essay demonstrates a good attempt at addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has chosen to write about a personal experience of patience, which is a good approach. However, the essay lacks a clear and concise narrative structure, making it difficult to follow at times.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it hard to understand the sequence of events. For instance, the student starts by mentioning waiting for a friend to get home from school, but then shifts to playing Xbox and getting online with another friend. The connection between these events is unclear.

Another issue is the use of informal language and slang, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Phrases like ""I did plenty of things"" and ""got on the computer"" are not suitable for formal writing. Additionally, the use of abbreviations like ""@NUM1"" and ""@CAPS1"" is unnecessary and should be avoided.

The student has attempted to describe the mood created by the author in the memoir, but their analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks depth. They have identified some relevant elements that contribute to the mood, such as the author's discussion of family, memories, and the warmth of the home. However, their explanation is often vague and relies on general statements rather than specific textual evidence.

For instance, when discussing the author's parents moving from Cuba, the student states that this would create a ""calm, caring, and happy mood."" While this is a reasonable inference, it would be more convincing if they provided specific details from the text to support this claim. Similarly, when describing the atmosphere of the home, the student mentions ""passionate Cuban music"" and ""aromas of the kitchen,"" but fails to explain how these elements specifically contribute to the mood.

The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computers on society, particularly on children. The writer effectively uses personal anecdotes and statistics to support their argument. However, the writing is marred by several issues that detract from the overall quality of the essay.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and organization. The essay jumps abruptly from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For instance, the writer starts by discussing the benefits of computers, only to shift gears and focus on the negative effects. This lack of cohesion makes it challenging to understand the writer's main argument.

Another issue is the use of simplistic and emotive language, which often comes across as immature. Phrases such as ""dispicable,"" ""waste,"" and ""outragous"" are overused and detract from the writer's credibility. Additionally, the writer relies heavily on personal anecdotes, which, while engaging, are not always relevant to the topic at hand.

Furthermore, the writer's use of statistics is often inaccurate or misinterpreted. For example, the claim that ""at least an hour @MONEY1 exercise is needed everyday"" is not supported by any credible sources, and the statement that ""@PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because @MONEY1 to much information on the internet"" is an unsubstantiated claim.

However, the student could have provided more depth and analysis of these obstacles, and supported their points with more specific details from the excerpt.

The student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence ""This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations"" could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to connect their ideas and make the essay flow better.

The student has attempted to address the prompt, but their response lacks clarity and coherence. The essay starts by stating that the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but fails to provide a clear explanation or supporting evidence. The student mentions two specific features: the lack of information on where to go and the lack of water. However, the connection between these features and their impact on the cyclist is not well-established.

The student states that the cyclist needed water for his trip, which is a reasonable point, but does not elaborate on how the lack of water specifically affects the cyclist. Additionally, the sentence ""This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go"" is unclear and contains grammatical errors. The use of ""were"" instead of ""where"" in the phrase ""on were to go"" is a notable error.

The student's response could be improved by providing more specific examples and explanations of how the features of the setting impact the cyclist. For instance, they could describe how the lack of information on where to go might lead to confusion or disorientation, or how the lack of water might affect the cyclist's physical well-being or performance.

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. However, there are some areas that need improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the essay lacks specific and detailed examples from the memoir to support the claims made about the mood. For instance, the statement ""He looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphere of his home"" could be more effective if it were accompanied by a specific description from the memoir that illustrates this atmosphere. This would help the reader visualize and connect with the author's emotions.

Secondly, there are some grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as ""gratefullness,"" ""courageus,"" and ""hospitable."" These errors can be distracting and detract from the overall impact of the essay. Additionally, some sentences are worded awkwardly, such as ""Setting a mood a gratefulness a true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget."" This sentence is unclear and could be rephrased for better coherence.

Thirdly, the essay could benefit from more nuanced and specific language to describe the mood created by the author. While the essay states that the mood is ""happy and lighthearted,"" it would be more effective to provide specific examples from the memoir that demonstrate this mood, such as a particular anecdote or description that showcases the author's joy and appreciation.

Lastly, the essay could be strengthened by providing more analysis and depth to the author's emotions and experiences. For example, the essay could explore how the author's experiences with his parents and community shaped his perspective on life and influenced his mood.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has effectively used specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, citing relevant details such as the flammability of hydrogen, the violent winds at the top of the building, and the pre-existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have explored the potential consequences of a dirigible accident or the impact of the law on the builders' plans. Additionally, some of the sentences could be more concise and varied in terms of sentence structure.

The student's use of transition words and phrases, such as ""Another potential obstacle"" and ""A final and very obvious obstacle,"" is good, but could be improved with more sophisticated language. The conclusion could also be more effective in summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it falls short in several areas. The student has attempted to write a personal anecdote about being patient, but the narrative is disjointed and lacks coherence. The essay jumps between different scenes and events without a clear chronological order, making it challenging to follow.

One of the significant strengths of the essay is the student's attempt to showcase their patience in various situations. They describe their efforts to act patiently, such as cooking breakfast for their mom and dressing professionally, which demonstrates their understanding of the concept of patience. However, the execution of these scenes is marred by grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of descriptive language.

The student's writing is also hindered by the inclusion of irrelevant details, such as the specific dates and times, which do not add to the narrative. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""I was feeling intense"" and ""my smile turned into a fake smile"" could be more effectively conveyed through more descriptive language.

To improve, the student should focus on creating a more cohesive narrative, using more descriptive language, and eliminating unnecessary details. They should also work on varying sentence structure and avoiding grammatical errors.

The essay demonstrates a good effort in addressing the prompt, but it requires improvement in several areas. The student has attempted to share a personal experience of being patient, but the writing is marred by grammatical errors, lack of coherence, and unclear sentences. The essay could benefit from more attention to detail and organization.

One of the major issues with the essay is the abundance of grammatical errors, including misspelled words, incorrect verb tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For instance, the sentence ""It fit live it would never spend"" should be rewritten as ""I didn't have my game or music player, and it felt like it would never end."" Similarly, the sentence ""Not as in thout to myself"" should be rewritten as ""Not even thinking to myself."" These errors make the essay difficult to understand and detract from the student's message.

Another issue with the essay is the lack of coherence and organization. The student jumps between different ideas and events without clear transitions or connections. For example, the essay shifts abruptly from describing the train ride to the museum to talking about the history exhibit. A clearer structure and more logical flow of ideas would improve the essay's overall clarity.

The student also struggles to provide specific details and examples to support their claim about patience. While they mention that they didn't complain during the train rides, they don't provide any concrete reasons why they were patient or how they felt during those experiences. Adding more descriptive language and sensory details would help the reader visualize and connect with the student's experience.

Finally, the essay could benefit from more attention to sentence-level writing. Many of the sentences are short and lack variety, which makes the essay feel choppy and difficult to read. The student could try using more complex sentence structures and varying their sentence length to create a more engaging and dynamic writing style.

The student has made an attempt to address the prompt, but their response lacks depth and specific details from the story to support their claim. They simply state that the test is a big part of Saeng's life or tradition without providing any evidence from the story to back up this assertion. The student fails to consider the significance of the test in the context of the story and its impact on Saeng's character development.

For instance, the story does not explicitly mention that the test is a significant part of Saeng's life or tradition. Instead, the test seems to be a pivotal moment in Saeng's journey, as it is the reason she is struggling to come to terms with her past and her identity. The story's focus on Saeng's emotional state and her connection to the hibiscus plant suggests that the test is more than just a routine event, but rather a symbol of her growth and self-discovery.

Furthermore, the student does not consider the symbolism of the hibiscus plant and its connection to Saeng's decision to retake the test. The hibiscus plant is described as ""budding"" in the spring, which suggests new life and renewal. This imagery implies that Saeng's decision to retake the test is not just a repetition of a past event, but rather a new beginning and an opportunity for growth.

Evaluation: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the author's intention in concluding the story with the given paragraph.

However, the analysis could be more nuanced and detailed. The student could have explored the symbolism of the hibiscus plant and its significance in Saeng's life, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

The essay provided demonstrates a good effort from the student in addressing the prompt about censorship in libraries. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance the overall quality of the writing. 

Firstly, the introduction could be more effective in grabbing the reader's attention. The opening sentence, ""Libraries Do you go to libraries?"" is a bit too casual and does not directly address the topic of censorship. A more engaging introduction that sets the stage for the discussion on censorship would be beneficial.

The body of the essay attempts to provide various reasons why people visit libraries, but it lacks a clear connection to the topic of censorship. The student mentions their personal experiences and observations, which is a good start, but it would be more effective if they directly linked these experiences to the issue of censorship. For instance, they could discuss how censorship affects the availability of certain books or materials in libraries.

The student also raises a valid point about the rules and restrictions in libraries, such as the requirement for a library card and parental permission for children to borrow books. However, this point could be further developed to explore its relevance to the topic of censorship.

The conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points made in the essay. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the student's stance on censorship and provide a final thought or call to action.

Score: 3

The student identifies the moods of love, happiness, and selflessness, which are all relevant to the memoir. However, the analysis could be more nuanced and supported by more specific quotes and explanations.

The student correctly identifies the excerpt where the author mentions learning the true definition of family, which creates a mood of love. However, the analysis could be more detailed, such as explaining how the author's use of words like ""gracious neighborhood"" contributes to the mood of love. Additionally, the student could have explored how this mood is developed throughout the memoir.

The student also identifies selflessness as a mood, but the analysis is somewhat vague. The student could have provided more specific examples from the text to support this claim, such as explaining how the author's description of immigrants leaving behind their families and careers to give their children a better life creates a sense of selflessness.

The student's analysis of happiness as a mood is also somewhat superficial.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the prompt, but their analysis of the setting's impact on the cyclist is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. They have identified some key features of the setting, such as the ""ghost town,"" the ""ramshackle shed,"" and the road sign, and have attempted to explain how these features affect the cyclist. However, their analysis is often based on surface-level observations and lacks supporting evidence from the text.

For example, when discussing the ""ghost town,"" the student states that the narrator ""chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,"" which suggests that the narrator is not especially worried. However, the student fails to consider the narrator's tone and the context of the situation. The chuckle could be interpreted as a nervous laugh, and the narrator's actions could be seen as a sign of anxiety rather than nonchalance.

Similarly, when discussing the ""ramshackle shed,"" the student notes that the narrator describes the place as ""troubling"" and concludes that the narrator wouldn't replenish his water there. However, the student doesn't consider the narrator's emotional state or the potential symbolism of the shed. The narrator's description of the shed as ""troubling"" could suggest that it's a foreboding or ominous place, which might affect the cyclist's mood and behavior.

The student also makes a claim that the setting is ""all the fault"" of the cyclist's negative experience, which oversimplifies the complex relationship between the setting and the narrator. While the setting certainly contributes to the narrator's mood and actions, it's unlikely that it's the sole cause of his negative experience.

1. **Clear thesis statement**: The essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the argument. The student starts with a statement that opposes censorship, but it's not explicitly stated as a thesis. A stronger opening sentence could be: ""I firmly believe that no books should be removed from library shelves, as censorship restricts individual freedom of choice and promotes a narrow-minded society.""

2. **Organization and coherence**: The essay jumps between different ideas, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. For example, the transition from discussing personal taste in horror novels to poetry is abrupt. The student could use transitional phrases or sentences to connect their ideas and create a more cohesive narrative.

3. **Supporting evidence**: While the student mentions their personal preferences and experiences, they could provide more concrete evidence to support their argument. For instance, they could discuss specific examples of books or authors that have been censored and how it affects the community.

4. **Writing style and vocabulary**: The essay contains some grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and informal language (e.g., ""Its very hard"" instead of ""It's very hard""). The student could benefit from revising their writing to make it more polished and engaging.

The student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and has attempted to express their opinion on censorship in libraries. However, the essay lacks depth and clarity in its arguments. The writing is simple and lacks proper organization, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

One of the major issues with the essay is the lack of supporting evidence. The student relies heavily on vague statements, such as ""they should be removed for those various reasons,"" without providing concrete examples or explanations. This makes it challenging to understand the student's perspective and makes the argument less convincing.

The student also struggles with sentence structure and grammar. There are several run-on sentences, missing articles, and incorrect verb tenses. For example, ""A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people."" The use of semicolons and commas is also inconsistent.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitional phrases and connecting words is limited, making the essay feel disjointed. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the purpose of a library to arguing for censorship without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

Despite these challenges, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and attempts to address the question. With more practice and attention to organization, sentence structure, and supporting evidence, the student has the potential to write a more effective and persuasive essay.

Evaluation: The essay attempts to address the prompt but lacks depth and clarity in its explanation of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The writer fails to provide a clear and concise thesis statement, and the supporting evidence is limited to a single sentence. The use of quotes is also not effectively integrated into the essay.

The essay starts by describing the cyclist's surroundings as ""old and barren"" and mentions the ""hot @CAPS1 like weather."" However, it does not explicitly explain how these features affect the cyclist. The sentence ""The road is hard to ride on"" is a good start, but it is not supported by any further explanation or evidence. The quote ""Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills"" seems to be a contradictory statement, as it suggests that the road is not as flat as initially described. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the essay.

Furthermore, the writer could have provided more details about the cyclist's physical and emotional state as a result of the challenging setting. For example, they could have described how the hot weather made the cyclist feel tired or thirsty, or how the rough road affected their balance and control.

To improve the essay, the writer should focus on providing a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. They should also provide more supporting evidence and details to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Additionally, they should ensure that the quotes are effectively integrated into the essay and do not contradict the main argument.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The writer identifies several key challenges, including safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen or helium in most foreign dirigibles, the risk of explosion, and the impact of wind currents at the top of the building. Additionally, the writer mentions the issue of dirigibles not being allowed to fly over urban areas, which made it difficult for them to approach the building.

However, there are some areas where the writer could improve. The essay could benefit from more specific and detailed information from the excerpt to support the writer's claims. For example, the writer mentions the Hindenburg incident, but does not provide any specific details about how it affected the builders' decisions. The writer also uses some vague language, such as ""it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws"" and ""Nature was believed to be its biggest obstacle,"" which could be more specific and concrete.

Furthermore, the writer could improve sentence structure and grammar. Some sentences are fragmented or contain errors, such as ""It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen of helium"" and ""The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast @CAPS1."" Additionally, the writer could use more precise vocabulary and avoid using phrases like ""most probably"" and ""belived.""

The essay provides a clear and concise description of the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student has identified the key themes of happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction, which are effectively supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, the essay could benefit from more detailed analysis and explanation of how these themes are developed throughout the text.

One of the strengths of the essay is its ability to identify the author's positive emotions and relationships with their family. The student correctly notes that the author is ""eternally greatful"" for their family and that they ""got along great and were very happy they had each other."" This suggests that the author values their relationships and finds joy in their family's company. Additionally, the student mentions that the family ""helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives,"" which highlights the author's sense of unity and compassion.

However, the essay could be improved by providing more specific quotes or examples from the memoir to support the student's claims. For instance, the student could have included a quote that illustrates the author's gratitude for their family or a specific instance where the family helped someone in need. This would have added more depth and credibility to the analysis.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more nuanced language and sentence structure. Some of the sentences are quite simple and lack variety, which makes the essay feel a bit flat. For example, the sentence ""That was the mood created by the author"" feels like a conclusion that could be more effectively supported by more detailed analysis.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The essay is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student has effectively used specific information from the excerpt to support their answer, citing relevant quotes and details.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The student could have provided more depth and analysis of the obstacles, rather than simply listing them. For example, they could have explained how the strong winds and debris from a crash would impact the building and the city. Additionally, the student could have provided more context about the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas, such as who enacted the law and when.

The student's writing is clear and concise, but there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation. For instance, the sentence ""For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building"" could be rephrased to improve clarity and flow.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the memoir's mood, but their analysis could be more in-depth and supported by more specific details from the text. The student has identified some key elements that contribute to the comfortable and loving mood, such as the description of the kitchen table in paragraph @NUM1, the mention of Passionate and Cuban music in paragraph @NUM2, and the expression of gratitude in paragraph @NUM3. However, the analysis could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of how these elements create the mood.

For instance, the student could have explored how the description of the kitchen table as a happy place where @LOCATION1, Sergio, and Edelmira would gather creates a sense of warmth and togetherness. They could have also analyzed how the mention of Passionate and Cuban music and the aromas of the kitchen in paragraph @NUM2 evoke a sense of joy and comfort. Furthermore, the student could have delved deeper into the significance of the first sentence in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and how it reveals the author's appreciation for the love and care they received in their childhood.

Additionally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures, as well as more precise vocabulary. For example, instead of saying ""This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what,"" the student could have written ""The narrative highlights the author's childhood home as a welcoming space where friends and family would gather, and where everyone was treated with kindness and compassion.""

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. They have identified three main challenges: the use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles, the unpredictable nature of the winds, and an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. However, there are several areas where the student's writing could be improved.

Firstly, the student has used the word ""obsticles"" instead of ""obstacles,"" which is a grammatical error that affects the overall clarity of the essay. Additionally, the student has not provided a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay.

Furthermore, the student's analysis of the obstacles is somewhat superficial. For example, when discussing the use of hydrogen in foreign dirigibles, the student only mentions that it is ""highly flammable,"" but does not explain why this is a significant concern. Similarly, when discussing the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, the student only mentions that it would be ""dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian,"" but does not explain how this law would impact the builders' ability to allow dirigibles to dock.

Finally, the student's writing could benefit from more varied and sophisticated vocabulary. For example, instead of using the phrase ""one last example,"" the student could use a more descriptive phrase to introduce the final obstacle.

The student has made a sincere effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on society. They have provided three main reasons to support their argument: computers taking away time from friends and family, contributing to the rise in obesity rates, and people spending too much time indoors. The student has also referenced a few studies to support their claims, which demonstrates their ability to incorporate outside sources into their writing.

However, there are several areas where the student's writing can be improved. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the essay. The student jumps directly into their arguments without providing a clear introduction that ties everything together.

Additionally, the student's writing is marred by grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect use of articles, and misspelled words. For example, ""I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family"" should be ""I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining than being with your friends and family."" These errors can make the essay difficult to follow and detract from the student's message.

Furthermore, the student's use of transitions between paragraphs is lacking, making the essay feel disjointed and hard to follow. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the rise in obesity rates to talking about people spending too much time indoors, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas.

Finally, the student's conclusion feels abrupt and lacks a clear call to action. The student states that computers have ""only created a nuisance to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life,"" but does not provide a clear solution or suggestion for how to address this issue.

Strengths:

1. The student has taken a clear stance on the topic, which is a crucial aspect of persuasive writing.
2. They have provided relevant historical context, such as the American colonies' struggle against censorship, to support their argument.
3. The student has acknowledged the need for some form of censorship, such as the movie and song rating system, which shows an understanding of the complexity of the issue.
4. They have proposed a practical solution, suggesting a rating system or warning labels for potentially objectionable materials in libraries.

Weaknesses:

1. The essay could benefit from more nuanced and detailed explanations of the student's arguments. Some points, such as the comparison between the United States and communist countries, feel a bit superficial.

The student has attempted to write a story about a time when they were patient, but the essay lacks coherence and clarity. The narrative jumps abruptly from one event to another, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought. The use of transitions and connections between ideas is minimal, resulting in a disjointed reading experience.

One of the main issues with the essay is the lack of descriptive language and vivid details. The student relies heavily on simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which fails to engage the reader. For instance, when describing the room, the student states it was ""amazing"" and ""great,"" but does not provide any specific details to support this claim.

Furthermore, the student's use of capitalization is inconsistent, with proper nouns and titles not being capitalized correctly. This is evident in the use of ""@CAPS1"" instead of proper capitalization.

The student's writing also lacks depth and insight into the concept of patience. While they mention waiting in lines, they do not explore the emotional or psychological aspects of being patient. The essay feels more like a series of events rather than a thoughtful reflection on patience.

However, the student does attempt to use sensory details, such as listening to music on their iPod, which shows some awareness of the importance of sensory experiences in writing.

The student has demonstrated a clear stance on the topic, arguing that computers have a negative impact on society. The essay is well-structured, with three main points presented to support the claim: lack of exercise, neglect of nature, and strained social skills. However, the writing quality is marred by several issues that detract from the overall effectiveness of the argument.

One of the primary concerns is the lack of coherence and clarity in the writing. The student often uses simplistic sentence structures and relies heavily on vague phrases, such as ""Surely the effects of computers can't be good"" and ""This is a growing problem which must be put to end."" These phrases do not contribute to the argument and make the text seem less convincing.

Furthermore, the student struggles with grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of incorrect verb tenses, missing articles, and incorrect use of commas. For example, ""Experts say, '@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily'"" should be rephrased to ""Experts say that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily."" Additionally, the use of abbreviations like ""I. M."" and ""or"" (instead of ""or to the"") detract from the overall professionalism of the writing.

The student also relies heavily on general statements and lacks specific examples to support their claims. For instance, the statement ""Obesity and diabetes effects <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4"" is not supported by any concrete evidence. The student could have provided statistics or personal anecdotes to make the argument more convincing.

Finally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points. The student could have rephrased the conclusion to reiterate the main arguments and provide a final thought on the importance of addressing the issue.

The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt, which is to share a true story where laughter was an essential element in forming a friendship. The writer effectively uses a personal anecdote to illustrate how laughter brought them closer to their friend, @PERSON1. The story is engaging, and the writer's use of descriptive language helps the reader visualize the scene.

Strengths:

1.  The writer starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention, comparing laughter to magic. This sets the tone for the rest of the essay.
2.  The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene, such as ""the kitchen was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there.""

4.  The writer uses transitions effectively to move the story forward, such as ""Eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside.""

Weaknesses:

1.  The writer's writing style is informal, which may not be suitable for all audiences. The use of slang and colloquial expressions, such as ""you can't pass it up,"" may not be clear to all readers.
2.  The writer could have provided more detail about the writer's and @PERSON1's personalities, which would have made the story more engaging.
3.  The writer jumps abruptly from talking about the fire to discussing girls and cracking jokes. A smoother transition would have been more effective.
4.  The writer could have provided more depth to the story by exploring the themes of friendship and laughter in more detail.

4. **Language and vocabulary**: The student's writing is simple and lacks variety in vocabulary. The use of phrases like ""really bad for you"" and ""not very offensive"" is not effective in conveying a strong argument.
5. **Transitions and connections**: The essay lacks transitional phrases and connections between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, as described in the excerpt. The student has identified three main obstacles: the structural issue of the building's frame, the violent winds on top of the building, and the restriction on airship flight over urban areas. However, the student's analysis could be more detailed and nuanced.

The student's discussion of the structural issue is clear and concise, citing the need to modify and strengthen the building's frame to accommodate a moored dirigible. This shows a good understanding of the excerpt's content. However, the student could have provided more specific details from the excerpt to support this point, such as the exact words or phrases used by the author to describe the issue.

The student's discussion of the violent winds on top of the building is also clear, but it could be more effective if the student had provided more specific examples or quotes from the excerpt to illustrate this point. The student states that the winds ""often shifted directions,"" but it would be more convincing if they had provided a specific quote or description from the excerpt to support this claim.

The student's discussion of the restriction on airship flight over urban areas is accurate, but it could be more effective if the student had provided more context or explanation of how this restriction affected the builders' plans. The student simply states that this restriction made it ""impossible"" for dirigibles to moor on top of the building, but it would be more convincing if they had provided more specific details or quotes from the excerpt to support this claim.

In terms of writing quality, the student's essay is clear and easy to follow, but it could benefit from more varied and sophisticated sentence structures.
