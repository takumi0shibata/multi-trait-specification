# Note
I have made an effort to remove personally identifying information from the essays using the Named Entity Recognizer (NER). The relevant entities are identified in the text and then replaced with a string such as "{PERSON}", "{ORGANIZATION}", "{LOCATION}", "{DATE}", "{TIME}", "{MONEY}", "{PERCENT}”, “{CAPS}” (any capitalized word) and “{NUM}” (any digits). Please do not penalize the essay because of the anonymizations.
